300,Biped,"Biped is a charming and cooperative puzzle-platformer that delivers a fun and lighthearted experience. You control adorable robots, ""Aku"" and ""Sila,"" as they traverse a series of levels that require precision, teamwork, and creative problem-solving. The game’s standout mechanic is its unique movement system, where each leg is controlled individually, adding an extra layer of challenge and hilarity as you wobble around.

The puzzles are well-designed and progressively more difficult, encouraging communication and coordination, especially in co-op mode. Whether you’re balancing on narrow platforms or solving timing-based puzzles, every moment feels like a fun test of your teamwork skills.

Visually, the game’s colorful, minimalist aesthetic adds to its charm, and the lighthearted soundtrack complements the cheerful vibe. However, the game is relatively short, and while it’s perfect for a few hours of fun, some players might wish for more content.

Overall, Biped is a delightful co-op game that shines in its simplicity and creativity. It’s an ideal choice for those looking to enjoy some light puzzle-solving with a friend.",13.0,Positive

399,Biped,"Biped is a charming and cooperative puzzle-platformer that delivers a fun and lighthearted experience. You control adorable robots, ""Aku"" and ""Sila,"" as they traverse a series of levels that require precision, teamwork, and creative problem-solving. The game’s standout mechanic is its unique movement system, where each leg is controlled individually, adding an extra layer of challenge and hilarity as you wobble around.

The puzzles are well-designed and progressively more difficult, encouraging communication and coordination, especially in co-op mode. Whether you’re balancing on narrow platforms or solving timing-based puzzles, every moment feels like a fun test of your teamwork skills.

Visually, the game’s colorful, minimalist aesthetic adds to its charm, and the lighthearted soundtrack complements the cheerful vibe. However, the game is relatively short, and while it’s perfect for a few hours of fun, some players might wish for more content.

Overall, Biped is a delightful co-op game that shines in its simplicity and creativity. It’s an ideal choice for those looking to enjoy some light puzzle-solving with a friend.",14.0,Positive

Give it back",86.0,Positive
601,Project Winter - Blackout,"This DLC is completely worth it. For a great price, it completely changes the game. The map is SUPER new and redone, the new roles are very interesting and allow more complex and deceitful gameplays, and the new items along with all these add-ons are completely worth it. Many are complaining that this DLC splits the community but it doesn't. Only a host needs a DLC and you can have one free try per day on this DLC. That means you can give it a try and see if it's worth it YOURSELF. And once again, ITS PER DAY. Completely worth, give these devs the money they deserve",20.0,Positive
602,Project Winter - Blackout,"[h1]You Might Not Want to Buy This DLC[/h1]
In this review I will give a very detailed overview of what exactly is this DLC and what makes it different. Basically, this DLC is like another game mode. I am not going to say its bad I just believe that for most players its not a necessary purchase.

In Project Winter you have your classic 6 survivors 2 traitor’s games but in the Blackout DLC there are 3 key differences
[List]
[*]The map
[*]The Global Events
[*]The Roles/abilities
[/List]

[b]The Map[/b]
The map in Blackout has 9 hatches (similar to traitor hatches in the classic game mode) but survivors can take 8 of them. There is 1 hatch that only traitors can take that leads to the south-east part of the map which kind of like a little traitor hide away, with some traitor crates that they can open. The whole purpose of these hatches is to allow players quick travel across the map. Now this is interesting because while you can get to anywhere really fast it means you can also be quickly separated from the group with your screams to quite for anyone to ever hear.

[b]The Global Events[/b]
In the Blackout DLC it uses some of the same global events that are in the main game mode, but it also introduces two new ones. 

The first new event is called total eclipse. Everyone is exiled from the cabin and first objective, and it turns dark outside making it difficult for survivors to see far in front of them. The traitors have perfect vision during this event. Name tags are also hidden allowing sneak attacks to happen.

The second new event is called witching hour, basically all animals become aggressive towards people, and animals that were killed come back to life as ghosts. When the event ends all animals that aren’t normally hostile stop and all ghost animals disappear.

[b]The Roles[/b]
This is the biggest difference from the main game that this DLC offers and its basically the whole point of playing it. First off there is only 1 traitor at the start, but they aren’t like a normal traitor. Traitors are either a demon (you can convert people by knocking them) or a whisperer (you convert people by activating a hidden radius ability that slowly fills up a conversion bar). There are also survivor roles that are unique to this DLC which include: 
[List]
[*]Hunter (Can’t be converted to a traitor, and has the ability to use a truth serum once after charging up ability) 
[*]Yeti (You can’t be converted to a traitor, basically ID thief but instead of stealing a body you just have to complete your bonus objective and you can win with either the survivors or traitors
[*]Medium (Can see players who died walking around as ghosts, they can’t hear the ghosts but through movement this role can be used to gather important information)
[*]Padre (has the ability to give a boost to someone after its charged with time, the boost grants +50% of all stats so, health, hunger, warmth)
[/list]

The reason why you might not want to buy this DLC is because in my opinion the normal game is more fun, and there are always more classic game lobbies running. What I have found is most new players prefer the classic game mode and experienced players quickly grow tired of the DLC Game mode and develop a preference for classic, it’s what happened to me.

[b] So my final statement. If you are a very devoted Project Winter player and you plan to play 100+ hours and want to experience everything this game has to offer than buy it. Otherwise don’t, you already own the best game mode[/b]",28.0,Positive
603,Project Winter - Blackout,I bought the Project Winter bundle which includes this and the base game while it was on sale. The bundle was more on sale than the base game and was cheaper than the base game. So I got this DLC for -10 cents. 10/10 got 10 cents for free.,8.0,Positive
604,Project Winter - Blackout,"Project Winter - Blackout is a DLC for experienced players: wildlife is far more dangerous, the new roles promote a slower (and scarier) traitor infiltration and the overall supernatural feeling tunes up the anxiety.

Hoping to see new awesome stuff for this awesome hidden gem, keep up the good work, devs!
",4.0,Positive
605,Project Winter - Blackout,"[h1] This will be a fair review and overview of the content here [/h1]

[b] TL;DR [/b]
The game has a free trial mode to test out the DLC once a day. Its very well priced overall and IMO provides double the content of the base game without making the base game feel cheated on. Its worth a buy to support the Devs and the community they've grown but again its optional to buy this. My recommendation is if you like the main game buy it, if you want something more complex and harder than the base game then buy it, if you want to get a DLC that will give you more enjoyment that most modern AAA companies then [b] BUY IT [/b]

[b]Contents:[/b]
[list]
[*]Several unique and cool roles
[*]A new map with unique mechanics (no reused assets)
[*]Unique cosmetics
[*]2 new in game events
[*]New items
[*]A new and original twist to the traitors to make things fresh and new
[/list]

[h1] The Good [/h1]
[list]
[*] Optional and daily free trials
[*] Very good pricing
[*] New Unique map with a lot of care put into it 
[*] New items [spoiler] Flashbang, torch, crossbow repeater, and much more[/spoiler]
[*] A ton of unique roles which change up the gameplay a lot
[*] Very minor bugs and a helpful discord
[*] Exclusive DLC crate that has alterations of popular skins
[/list]

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] There are major balancing issues between roles and objective types
[*] The best way to prevent conversions is to kill each other instead of letting the problem grow. So you either kill off a hunch or lose at a very alarming rate.
[*] New players will have a hard transition between modes if they don't know vanilla game mechanics

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
One of the best DLC I've ever played and it switched up the game's formula rather well. This mode has been in development for a while and show very little fault which will be improved on later. I enjoy the change of pace and this is a [b] MUST [/b] buy. However.... [spoiler] NERF THE BEARTRAPS ALREADY(/s) [/spoiler]",43.0,Positive

608,Project Winter - Blackout,"I usually don't write reviews for games on Steam, but Project Winter's ""Blackout"" deserved it big time. If you're familiar with the base game, you know that there are a number of different roles you can play as. Blackout introduces new roles to the game as well as new items, objectives, achievements, global events, and more! Absolutely love the game, and you always start off with one traitor as opposed to the regular game where you start off with 2. Traitors can pretty easily convert players to the dark side, although the community has been saying Blackout is easier for the survivors than the original game. 

Nonetheless, if you have the base game or are considering buying the entire Project Winter bundle, I would definitely recommend ""Blackout."" Super addicting and a mix of super competitive and friendly players within the community.

657,Project Winter - Blackout,"[h1]You Might Not Want to Buy This DLC[/h1]
In this review I will give a very detailed overview of what exactly is this DLC and what makes it different. Basically, this DLC is like another game mode. I am not going to say its bad I just believe that for most players its not a necessary purchase.

In Project Winter you have your classic 6 survivors 2 traitor’s games but in the Blackout DLC there are 3 key differences
[List]
[*]The map
[*]The Global Events
[*]The Roles/abilities
[/List]

[b]The Map[/b]
The map in Blackout has 9 hatches (similar to traitor hatches in the classic game mode) but survivors can take 8 of them. There is 1 hatch that only traitors can take that leads to the south-east part of the map which kind of like a little traitor hide away, with some traitor crates that they can open. The whole purpose of these hatches is to allow players quick travel across the map. Now this is interesting because while you can get to anywhere really fast it means you can also be quickly separated from the group with your screams to quite for anyone to ever hear.

[b]The Global Events[/b]
In the Blackout DLC it uses some of the same global events that are in the main game mode, but it also introduces two new ones. 

The first new event is called total eclipse. Everyone is exiled from the cabin and first objective, and it turns dark outside making it difficult for survivors to see far in front of them. The traitors have perfect vision during this event. Name tags are also hidden allowing sneak attacks to happen.

The second new event is called witching hour, basically all animals become aggressive towards people, and animals that were killed come back to life as ghosts. When the event ends all animals that aren’t normally hostile stop and all ghost animals disappear.

[b]The Roles[/b]
This is the biggest difference from the main game that this DLC offers and its basically the whole point of playing it. First off there is only 1 traitor at the start, but they aren’t like a normal traitor. Traitors are either a demon (you can convert people by knocking them) or a whisperer (you convert people by activating a hidden radius ability that slowly fills up a conversion bar). There are also survivor roles that are unique to this DLC which include: 
[List]
[*]Hunter (Can’t be converted to a traitor, and has the ability to use a truth serum once after charging up ability) 
[*]Yeti (You can’t be converted to a traitor, basically ID thief but instead of stealing a body you just have to complete your bonus objective and you can win with either the survivors or traitors
[*]Medium (Can see players who died walking around as ghosts, they can’t hear the ghosts but through movement this role can be used to gather important information)
[*]Padre (has the ability to give a boost to someone after its charged with time, the boost grants +50% of all stats so, health, hunger, warmth)
[/list]

The reason why you might not want to buy this DLC is because in my opinion the normal game is more fun, and there are always more classic game lobbies running. What I have found is most new players prefer the classic game mode and experienced players quickly grow tired of the DLC Game mode and develop a preference for classic, it’s what happened to me.

[b] So my final statement. If you are a very devoted Project Winter player and you plan to play 100+ hours and want to experience everything this game has to offer than buy it. Otherwise don’t, you already own the best game mode[/b]",28.0,Positive
658,Project Winter - Blackout,I bought the Project Winter bundle which includes this and the base game while it was on sale. The bundle was more on sale than the base game and was cheaper than the base game. So I got this DLC for -10 cents. 10/10 got 10 cents for free.,8.0,Positive
659,Project Winter - Blackout,"Project Winter - Blackout is a DLC for experienced players: wildlife is far more dangerous, the new roles promote a slower (and scarier) traitor infiltration and the overall supernatural feeling tunes up the anxiety.

Hoping to see new awesome stuff for this awesome hidden gem, keep up the good work, devs!
",4.0,Positive
660,Project Winter - Blackout,"[h1] This will be a fair review and overview of the content here [/h1]

[b] TL;DR [/b]
The game has a free trial mode to test out the DLC once a day. Its very well priced overall and IMO provides double the content of the base game without making the base game feel cheated on. Its worth a buy to support the Devs and the community they've grown but again its optional to buy this. My recommendation is if you like the main game buy it, if you want something more complex and harder than the base game then buy it, if you want to get a DLC that will give you more enjoyment that most modern AAA companies then [b] BUY IT [/b]

[b]Contents:[/b]
[list]
[*]Several unique and cool roles
[*]A new map with unique mechanics (no reused assets)
[*]Unique cosmetics
[*]2 new in game events
[*]New items
[*]A new and original twist to the traitors to make things fresh and new
[/list]

[h1] The Good [/h1]
[list]
[*] Optional and daily free trials
[*] Very good pricing
[*] New Unique map with a lot of care put into it 
[*] New items [spoiler] Flashbang, torch, crossbow repeater, and much more[/spoiler]
[*] A ton of unique roles which change up the gameplay a lot
[*] Very minor bugs and a helpful discord
[*] Exclusive DLC crate that has alterations of popular skins
[/list]

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] There are major balancing issues between roles and objective types
[*] The best way to prevent conversions is to kill each other instead of letting the problem grow. So you either kill off a hunch or lose at a very alarming rate.
[*] New players will have a hard transition between modes if they don't know vanilla game mechanics

[b]The Global Events[/b]
In the Blackout DLC it uses some of the same global events that are in the main game mode, but it also introduces two new ones. 

The first new event is called total eclipse. Everyone is exiled from the cabin and first objective, and it turns dark outside making it difficult for survivors to see far in front of them. The traitors have perfect vision during this event. Name tags are also hidden allowing sneak attacks to happen.

The second new event is called witching hour, basically all animals become aggressive towards people, and animals that were killed come back to life as ghosts. When the event ends all animals that aren’t normally hostile stop and all ghost animals disappear.

[b]The Roles[/b]
This is the biggest difference from the main game that this DLC offers and its basically the whole point of playing it. First off there is only 1 traitor at the start, but they aren’t like a normal traitor. Traitors are either a demon (you can convert people by knocking them) or a whisperer (you convert people by activating a hidden radius ability that slowly fills up a conversion bar). There are also survivor roles that are unique to this DLC which include: 
[List]
[*]Hunter (Can’t be converted to a traitor, and has the ability to use a truth serum once after charging up ability) 
[*]Yeti (You can’t be converted to a traitor, basically ID thief but instead of stealing a body you just have to complete your bonus objective and you can win with either the survivors or traitors
[*]Medium (Can see players who died walking around as ghosts, they can’t hear the ghosts but through movement this role can be used to gather important information)
[*]Padre (has the ability to give a boost to someone after its charged with time, the boost grants +50% of all stats so, health, hunger, warmth)
[/list]

The reason why you might not want to buy this DLC is because in my opinion the normal game is more fun, and there are always more classic game lobbies running. What I have found is most new players prefer the classic game mode and experienced players quickly grow tired of the DLC Game mode and develop a preference for classic, it’s what happened to me.

[b] So my final statement. If you are a very devoted Project Winter player and you plan to play 100+ hours and want to experience everything this game has to offer than buy it. Otherwise don’t, you already own the best game mode[/b]",28.0,Positive
713,Project Winter - Blackout,I bought the Project Winter bundle which includes this and the base game while it was on sale. The bundle was more on sale than the base game and was cheaper than the base game. So I got this DLC for -10 cents. 10/10 got 10 cents for free.,8.0,Positive
714,Project Winter - Blackout,"Project Winter - Blackout is a DLC for experienced players: wildlife is far more dangerous, the new roles promote a slower (and scarier) traitor infiltration and the overall supernatural feeling tunes up the anxiety.

715,Project Winter - Blackout,"[h1] This will be a fair review and overview of the content here [/h1]

[b] TL;DR [/b]
The game has a free trial mode to test out the DLC once a day. Its very well priced overall and IMO provides double the content of the base game without making the base game feel cheated on. Its worth a buy to support the Devs and the community they've grown but again its optional to buy this. My recommendation is if you like the main game buy it, if you want something more complex and harder than the base game then buy it, if you want to get a DLC that will give you more enjoyment that most modern AAA companies then [b] BUY IT [/b]

[b]Contents:[/b]
[list]
[*]Several unique and cool roles
[*]A new map with unique mechanics (no reused assets)
[*]Unique cosmetics
[*]2 new in game events
[*]New items
[*]A new and original twist to the traitors to make things fresh and new

[h1] The Good [/h1]
[list]
[*] Optional and daily free trials
[*] Very good pricing
[*] New Unique map with a lot of care put into it 
[*] New items [spoiler] Flashbang, torch, crossbow repeater, and much more[/spoiler]
[*] A ton of unique roles which change up the gameplay a lot
[*] Very minor bugs and a helpful discord
[*] Exclusive DLC crate that has alterations of popular skins
[/list]

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] There are major balancing issues between roles and objective types
[*] The best way to prevent conversions is to kill each other instead of letting the problem grow. So you either kill off a hunch or lose at a very alarming rate.
[*] New players will have a hard transition between modes if they don't know vanilla game mechanics
[/list]

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
One of the best DLC I've ever played and it switched up the game's formula rather well. This mode has been in development for a while and show very little fault which will be improved on later. I enjoy the change of pace and this is a [b] MUST [/b] buy. However.... [spoiler] NERF THE BEARTRAPS ALREADY(/s) [/spoiler]",43.0,Positive

718,Project Winter - Blackout,"I usually don't write reviews for games on Steam, but Project Winter's ""Blackout"" deserved it big time. If you're familiar with the base game, you know that there are a number of different roles you can play as. Blackout introduces new roles to the game as well as new items, objectives, achievements, global events, and more! Absolutely love the game, and you always start off with one traitor as opposed to the regular game where you start off with 2. Traitors can pretty easily convert players to the dark side, although the community has been saying Blackout is easier for the survivors than the original game. 

Nonetheless, if you have the base game or are considering buying the entire Project Winter bundle, I would definitely recommend ""Blackout."" Super addicting and a mix of super competitive and friendly players within the community.

767,Project Winter - Blackout,"[h1]You Might Not Want to Buy This DLC[/h1]
In this review I will give a very detailed overview of what exactly is this DLC and what makes it different. Basically, this DLC is like another game mode. I am not going to say its bad I just believe that for most players its not a necessary purchase.

In Project Winter you have your classic 6 survivors 2 traitor’s games but in the Blackout DLC there are 3 key differences
[List]
[*]The map
[*]The Global Events
[*]The Roles/abilities
[/List]

[b]The Map[/b]
The map in Blackout has 9 hatches (similar to traitor hatches in the classic game mode) but survivors can take 8 of them. There is 1 hatch that only traitors can take that leads to the south-east part of the map which kind of like a little traitor hide away, with some traitor crates that they can open. The whole purpose of these hatches is to allow players quick travel across the map. Now this is interesting because while you can get to anywhere really fast it means you can also be quickly separated from the group with your screams to quite for anyone to ever hear.

[b]The Global Events[/b]
In the Blackout DLC it uses some of the same global events that are in the main game mode, but it also introduces two new ones. 

The first new event is called total eclipse. Everyone is exiled from the cabin and first objective, and it turns dark outside making it difficult for survivors to see far in front of them. The traitors have perfect vision during this event. Name tags are also hidden allowing sneak attacks to happen.

The second new event is called witching hour, basically all animals become aggressive towards people, and animals that were killed come back to life as ghosts. When the event ends all animals that aren’t normally hostile stop and all ghost animals disappear.

This is the biggest difference from the main game that this DLC offers and its basically the whole point of playing it. First off there is only 1 traitor at the start, but they aren’t like a normal traitor. Traitors are either a demon (you can convert people by knocking them) or a whisperer (you convert people by activating a hidden radius ability that slowly fills up a conversion bar).

822,Project Winter - Blackout,"[h1]You Might Not Want to Buy This DLC[/h1]
In this review I will give a very detailed overview of what exactly is this DLC and what makes it different. Basically, this DLC is like another game mode. I am not going to say its bad I just believe that for most players its not a necessary purchase.

In Project Winter you have your classic 6 survivors 2 traitor’s games but in the Blackout DLC there are 3 key differences
[List]
[*]The map
[*]The Global Events
[*]The Roles/abilities
[/List]

[b]The Map[/b]
The map in Blackout has 9 hatches (similar to traitor hatches in the classic game mode) but survivors can take 8 of them. There is 1 hatch that only traitors can take that leads to the south-east part of the map which kind of like a little traitor hide away, with some traitor crates that they can open. The whole purpose of these hatches is to allow players quick travel across the map. Now this is interesting because while you can get to anywhere really fast it means you can also be quickly separated from the group with your screams to quite for anyone to ever hear.

[b]The Global Events[/b]
In the Blackout DLC it uses some of the same global events that are in the main game mode, but it also introduces two new ones. 

The first new event is called total eclipse. Everyone is exiled from the cabin and first objective, and it turns dark outside making it difficult for survivors to see far in front of them. The traitors have perfect vision during this event. Name tags are also hidden allowing sneak attacks to happen.

The second new event is called witching hour, basically all animals become aggressive towards people, and animals that were killed come back to life as ghosts. When the event ends all animals that aren’t normally hostile stop and all ghost animals disappear.

[b]The Roles[/b]
This is the biggest difference from the main game that this DLC offers and its basically the whole point of playing it. First off there is only 1 traitor at the start, but they aren’t like a normal traitor. Traitors are either a demon (you can convert people by knocking them) or a whisperer (you convert people by activating a hidden radius ability that slowly fills up a conversion bar). There are also survivor roles that are unique to this DLC which include: 
[List]
[*]Hunter (Can’t be converted to a traitor, and has the ability to use a truth serum once after charging up ability) 
[*]Yeti (You can’t be converted to a traitor, basically ID thief but instead of stealing a body you just have to complete your bonus objective and you can win with either the survivors or traitors
[*]Medium (Can see players who died walking around as ghosts, they can’t hear the ghosts but through movement this role can be used to gather important information)
[*]Padre (has the ability to give a boost to someone after its charged with time, the boost grants +50% of all stats so, health, hunger, warmth)
[/list]

The reason why you might not want to buy this DLC is because in my opinion the normal game is more fun, and there are always more classic game lobbies running. What I have found is most new players prefer the classic game mode and experienced players quickly grow tired of the DLC Game mode and develop a preference for classic, it’s what happened to me.

[b] So my final statement. If you are a very devoted Project Winter player and you plan to play 100+ hours and want to experience everything this game has to offer than buy it. Otherwise don’t, you already own the best game mode[/b]",28.0,Positive
823,Project Winter - Blackout,I bought the Project Winter bundle which includes this and the base game while it was on sale. The bundle was more on sale than the base game and was cheaper than the base game. So I got this DLC for -10 cents. 10/10 got 10 cents for free.,8.0,Positive
824,Project Winter - Blackout,"Project Winter - Blackout is a DLC for experienced players: wildlife is far more dangerous, the new roles promote a slower (and scarier) traitor infiltration and the overall supernatural feeling tunes up the anxiety.

Hoping to see new awesome stuff for this awesome hidden gem, keep up the good work, devs!
",4.0,Positive
825,Project Winter - Blackout,"[h1] This will be a fair review and overview of the content here [/h1]

[b] TL;DR [/b]
The game has a free trial mode to test out the DLC once a day. Its very well priced overall and IMO provides double the content of the base game without making the base game feel cheated on. Its worth a buy to support the Devs and the community they've grown but again its optional to buy this. My recommendation is if you like the main game buy it, if you want something more complex and harder than the base game then buy it, if you want to get a DLC that will give you more enjoyment that most modern AAA companies then [b] BUY IT [/b]

[b]Contents:[/b]
[list]
[*]Several unique and cool roles
[*]A new map with unique mechanics (no reused assets)
[*]Unique cosmetics
[*]2 new in game events
[*]New items
[*]A new and original twist to the traitors to make things fresh and new
[/list]

[h1] The Good [/h1]
[list]
[*] Optional and daily free trials
[*] Very good pricing
[*] New Unique map with a lot of care put into it 
[*] New items [spoiler] Flashbang, torch, crossbow repeater, and much more[/spoiler]
[*] A ton of unique roles which change up the gameplay a lot
[*] Very minor bugs and a helpful discord
[*] Exclusive DLC crate that has alterations of popular skins
[/list]

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] There are major balancing issues between roles and objective types
[*] The best way to prevent conversions is to kill each other instead of letting the problem grow. So you either kill off a hunch or lose at a very alarming rate.
[*] New players will have a hard transition between modes if they don't know vanilla game mechanics
[/list]

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
One of the best DLC I've ever played and it switched up the game's formula rather well. This mode has been in development for a while and show very little fault which will be improved on later. I enjoy the change of pace and this is a [b] MUST [/b] buy. However.... [spoiler] NERF THE BEARTRAPS ALREADY(/s) [/spoiler]",43.0,Positive

828,Project Winter - Blackout,"I usually don't write reviews for games on Steam, but Project Winter's ""Blackout"" deserved it big time. If you're familiar with the base game, you know that there are a number of different roles you can play as. Blackout introduces new roles to the game as well as new items, objectives, achievements, global events, and more! Absolutely love the game, and you always start off with one traitor as opposed to the regular game where you start off with 2. Traitors can pretty easily convert players to the dark side, although the community has been saying Blackout is easier for the survivors than the original game. 

Nonetheless, if you have the base game or are considering buying the entire Project Winter bundle, I would definitely recommend ""Blackout."" Super addicting and a mix of super competitive and friendly players within the community.

886,Project Winter - Blackout,"Long search for a lobby but after a while me and my friend found one. We get instantly killed and a song of George Floyd that cant breath gets blasted in our ears. The people were dancing and singing while screaming on this song for 30 minutes...
Best 5 dollars i have ever spent. 10/10",2.0,Positive
887,Project Winter - Blackout,I bought both the game and the dlc while it was in free weekend. I bought them while I was IN the game so dlc bugged and can't use any function of the dlc. I paid the price but still can't play dlc what a bug.,3.0,Negative

893,Project Winter - Blackout,"YOU NEED MICROPHONE, THE THING YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO TALK IN TO!

If you cannot find the lobby, just host one maybe? :)",7.0,Positive

895,Project Winter - Blackout,"I love the base game, I have been a supporter for the longest time. Before it came out of beta. I even reviewed the game in December 2019...

BUT this DLC is terrible, I haven't found an English speaking lobby that hosts this game since I got it. No one plays it because it costs more money. You're better off buying another copy of the standard game for your friend.

TLDR: no one plays it, but its cool I guess",5.0,Negative

1232,Wobbly Life,"wobbly life is amazing,its really fun playing with random people and friends",0.0,Positive
1233,Wobbly Life,"Wobbly life is a great game, reminiscent of ""Human: Fall flat"" except it's entirely open world and has less focus on solving puzzles,
I'm not sure how great the experience would be alone, but if you have friends, you'll surely have a blast.
There's no real endgame or story, you are just doing jobs and quests, or messing around with the physics and vehicles.

The good:
+ Fun secrets
+ Wobbly physics, made more hilarious with your ability to grab on to almost anything, including moving players and vehicles
+ lots of collectibles (if you care about that kind of exploring)
+ Fitting sound and music

The bad:
- pets don't really serve any purpose, and will tire you with their noises
- homes don't serve much purpose either, they're mostly just a spawn point and a garage
- lacks actual story, but it's not too awful as the jobs and quests are kinda the main point
- the physics and controls aren't as perfected as some similar games like Human: Fall Flat, Gang Beasts and Party Animals

As long as you have something to do, it is an entertaining experience, but once you're out of jobs and quests, it hardly has staying power.
For an early access game, it has enough content to justify it's price and therefore it's an easy game to recommend.
I'd rate it around 7/10 if you're playing it alone, 8/10 if you have friends to play with.",0.0,Positive

I'm not sure how great the experience would be alone, but if you have friends, you'll surely have a blast.
There's no real endgame or story, you are just doing jobs and quests, or messing around with the physics and vehicles.

The good:
+ Fun secrets
+ Wobbly physics, made more hilarious with your ability to grab on to almost anything, including moving players and vehicles
+ lots of collectibles (if you care about that kind of exploring)
+ Fitting sound and music

The bad:
- pets don't really serve any purpose, and will tire you with their noises
- homes don't serve much purpose either, they're mostly just a spawn point and a garage
- lacks actual story, but it's not too awful as the jobs and quests are kinda the main point
- the physics and controls aren't as perfected as some similar games like Human: Fall Flat, Gang Beasts and Party Animals

As long as you have something to do, it is an entertaining experience, but once you're out of jobs and quests, it hardly has staying power.
For an early access game, it has enough content to justify it's price and therefore it's an easy game to recommend.
I'd rate it around 7/10 if you're playing it alone, 8/10 if you have friends to play with.",0.0,Positive

The only minor annoyance is not being able to load your mods when playing through GFN.

1500,Party Animals,"Long story short? 🤔
The game is fun and justifies its price (I’ve paid ~$6.5) — it has a really slick and nice UI, UX is decent enough, the gameplay is tons of fun and some modes/maps are hilarious 😂

There’s quite a variety of modes:
• Mario Kart alike gamemode
• Fighting maps
• Team based maps where you need to do various objectives (the most diversed mode)
• Smash Bros-esque 6 rounds fighting mode with roguelite (kinda) element!
• Also there’s a hub map (available only in Custom Modes) with 2 board games — one is, basically, UNO, but another one I didn’t try (needs more than 2 players).
• And so on…

My main gripe with the game is that Party Animals desperately needs more content — and I’m not talking about cosmetics, but maps and modes.

Currently, there’s quite little variety!

While the game is fun for the first time which you can prolong by playing a few maps per one time, but you will consume all the content pretty fast. Actually very fast. The game will last way longer if you have friends/family/partner, but it still won’t last long. Maybe a few weekends, tops.

The only solution I see is for the devs to drop one map/mode per month, at least.
Okay, maybe per two months, which is hilariously bad, but still something.

The game is paid but there’s such a huge amount of paid content, it’s baffling.

Like so many paid currencies!

Remember that hub map I’ve talked about? You can buy placeable stuff like swings and fireworks for ONE OF PAID CURRENCIES — and these placeables are CONSUMABLES, so they are not infinite. You can, somehow, earn this paid currency, but it’s very-very slow.

There’s an in-game currency (which you can still exchange to via main paid currency), but you cannot buy much stuff for it. There are even loot boxes. I’m okay-ish with them, however you get very little currency for said loot boxes — though you can pay real money to get them, of course.

Anyway, I wish the devs all the best, I really hope they will add more content reasonably fast.

If they implement some sort of map/mode builder, then it’ll be a banger for sure! 🔥

Well, that’s about it.

Message to the devs ✉️

“You are cooking a really good game, you already making something extremely fun and diverse — please continue making good stuff and do not abandon the game, neither flood it with microtransactions. Also, thanks a lot for the Friend’s Pass system — it’s amazing! We can invite one player for free and play with them in (almost?) all modes!”

P.S:

The game doesn’t have an offline mode (or so it seems). Please keep it in mind. I didn’t test local co-op, but, as far as I understand, it works. However, again, you need to have internet connection. I do not know any limitations of local co-op, but I do know that there’s split screen (not every map/mode has it!) and you can connect multiple controllers.

Hopefully someone will make a handler for this game for NucleusCOOP 💯",35.0,Positive

1504,Party Animals,"Note: Sadly I've requested a refund for this game.

Party Animals is a great example of a brilliant concept held hostage to poor execution and restrictions.
Taking a lot of inspiration from the popular game 'Gang Beasts', Party Animals takes on the appearance of a sandbox-style physics based fighting game where the player chooses from a large number of avatars to do battle across a number of interactive environments as well as the recent inclusion of mario-kart style minigames.

Overall the game's appearance is charming, and well polished. Character models and variants are funny to play around with and the gameplay is close to identical to what I would expect from Gang Beasts.

Sadly the drawbacks and limitations on this game are its downfall.
It would seem that the game has been built heavily around touting cosmetic microtransactions. At the time of this review, about 75% of the Main Menu is overcrowded with panels pushing sales and discounts.
The biggest let down however is that this game requires a constant internet connection to function and provides a limited split-screen capability. The developers have stated that they have no plans to introduce an offline mode, a big mistake in my opinion.

Party Animals sadly falls short of its name, taking a brilliant easy-going sandbox button-masher and holding it hostage to requiring a constant internet connection to work and a reduced experience. Yet all this could be easily reversed by introducing the sandbox experience that made its predecessors a success.",11.0,Negative

fun party game with an incredibly friendly friend pass system, where only one person has to pay for the full game, enabling *one* friend per copy to use the friend pass and play the game for free!
through this system alone i have shown off this game to a many of my friends, resulting in them actually purchasing the game for themselves as they enjoyed it way more than they thought they would.
the friend pass gives ""barebones"" access to the game, needing the paying player to invite them, they do not have access to cosmetics nor achievements however these are not necessary for what is essentially a ""demo version"" of the game.

1555,Party Animals,"Looking around on social media the game immediately had my attention because of how funny the videos were. Playing it now... Yeah. It still is funny. 

Skins (in my opinion) are easy to get if you're doing quick matches. I was looking around on forums about why I wasn't getting a lot of XP for the Dogs VS Cats event and you need to play quick matches for more. And when I say more, I mean A LOT more. There is a cap on how many bucks you get (with the leveling up system) which confuses me? There's probably a ton of skins from what I've seen and there's no real reason to have a leveling cap for that. Unless we can get the skins a different way. I don't know though, I got it a few days ago. (There's also some cool looking skins so wth)

Game modes are fine for the most part. I can cycle through without getting bored. But I agree that we do need an offline mode. I can't play Nemo Kart without my kart stopping multiple times (due to my horrendous ping). Every other game seems to play good though. And quick match adds on to those so you can't get bored while playing. 

Quick match is easy, but seems to be a more competitive option to custom games. I'm guessing this was set up to help with the pass and the Dogs VS Cats update. It's not a bad thing, it's just odd to have a competitive style in a party game. I would just suggest making getting XP in custom games easier, since you barely get anything for that compared to quick matches. Some people don't want to be competitive and grind everyday just to get a common skin, or from what I've heard a duplicate. (I don't know if the duplicate part is true though.) So far I've had no problems with this though. It gives me something to compete for.

The transactions are not much of an issue. You have to make profit somehow. Just make currency easier to get. More specifically the Nemo Bucks. Since there is a cap on the level apparently? (I still could be wrong about this so if anyone even reads this can you correct me lmao) But just from playing you get the currency to get skins. So not much of an issue to me. The one problem I do have is the XP you get from custom matches. Well, the XP for the factions rather. You barely get anything for it in custom matches.

This one mightttt be on me but the lag. The input lag is INSANE if you have a high ping. This might be on me again but I had to sit through a full day wondering why I've been getting horrible input lag. It's probably your ping. I see why people want an offline mode now.

Overall, the game isn't bad. I would recommend playing it if you just want to have fun with some friends. Apparently split-screen doesn't work but I don't have to reason to play split-screen. Just make an offline mode and I'm good. :P",0.0,Positive

Had enough of the team beatup game for a bit? Try the coop pirate mode where you have to fend of a bunch of pirates with your friends or maybe try one of the team game modes like football, hockey or american football. Looking for something different than smashing enemies? Maybe the winter cabin mode is better for you with a bunch of cozy activities and card games.

- Game requires a consistent internet connection, there is no offline mode (yet).
- You can invite a friend along without them having to pay for the game.
- Cosmetics in the game are 99.9% obtainable with in game currencies or through events, exceptions are certain collab skins.

1562,Party Animals,"I'll be honest..

I have spent far more time on this game over the last week + since buying it than I probably should have. Any time I have had free time, this game has taken priority because, as frustrating as it can be when things don't go the way you wanted them to, it's so darn silly and such good fun it's hard NOT to want to play it. Subtract about 6 - 8 hours at a guess from leaving the game running whilst AFK, and that's the genuine playtime.

[b]Let's talk about this awesome little game and it's modes.[/b]

[b]Classic :[/b] Last-Team Standing, with sports based and objective modes, all of the fun stuff.
[b]Smash :[/b] Pure combat. Every round, pick a card based power up and win points over six rounds.
[b]Nemo Kart :[/b] Kart-racing. More or less a carbon-copy of MK and a mid one at that.

Classic is, for me, the ideal, go-to mode. You have your combat maps, you have maps designed around securing objectives whilst fighting and you have maps designed around fighting and playing sports.

SMASH is, okay? If you like pure combat and no real objectives, this one is great as it'll rotate maps between rounds as you secure power-ups. Comeback potential is there as later rounds afford more points.

Nemo Kart is not that good. No reason to play it over other well designed alternatives really. It's there, but I think the developers should focus on other things, it's sub-par to me.

[b]The juicy stuff, how's the combat?[/b]

It's goofy, physics based, doesn't always go the way you expect it nor want it to, but even when it's frustrating, it's grand. I'd be lying if I said I haven't had mid-game mini-rants, arguing as to why I'm knocked out longer after a single punch than someone who I've KO'd three times for example, but even when it's frustrating, it can be funny and oh so enjoyable.

There isn't much complexity to it, knowledge comes more down to timing than anything else. You have a punch / sprint punch, kick / drop-kick and a headbutt / roll. You can obviously grab too. The grabbing is based more on proximity of where your arms are, rather than you having control of each arm, punches will be carried by momentum, headbutts aided by your ability to grab people and drop kicks are either super intentional or super random.

[b]So, what about progression and monetisation?[/b]

Right now, there's a free battle pass event going on, I'm unaware of previous passes. Upon purchase of the game, you'll also progress a 100-tier track through normal play and normal XP gain, of which you'll get multiple currencies and cosmetics. Cookies are given out very fairly, many shop skins can be bought with those, NEMO bucks given out more sparingly, but enough to use on the gacha system to test your luck if you wish and they also throw egg coins at you for the gacha system too, so you have a chance to unlock things always, without buying into MTX.

[b]So, should you buy it?[/b]

See if you have a mate that owns it first, ask them if they're willing to invite you and let you try via the friend pass and give it a go. If not, it's fairly affordable for what it is and I think monetisation contrasted with the progression you get is more than fair in this day and age.

I think it's worth every penny personally. I've loved it, I encouraged my kids to play it with me and we've laughed at it, I've had a few funny session with my wife on it too and I've even played it with some of my good mates as well and it's been top-notch every time, even when I get frustrated.

There is also additional game modes to choose from appart from the regular fighting gameplay. The sound effects is also a nice touch from a freezing snow blizzard to wind blasting past your character while walking on the wingtips of a airplane makes it a even more nerve wracking experience than anticipated while fighting out for glory against your friends. To put it simple, this is a combat game similar to Gang Beasts, but with way better graphics and simpler gameplay. So no need to be button mashing 20-30 times to acheive your wanted commands for your character. 

Pros - Unltimited fun to be had with your friends
Cons - The game is online only, so a internet connection is required at all times

Gameplay -  9/10

1564,Party Animals,"When you mix up a game with the ragdoll effect like Fall Guys; and you add the gameplay of Pummel Party games + Karting; you get Party Animals with very very cute furry characters to choose from. 

Although I have been beaten over and over again by my own teammates; and therefor actually lose even harder than normal. It's fun the first time, not so fun after a losing streak of 40. But you know, you can always hope to play against random bots, you might have a chance to win. 

But definitely worth playing if you have a bunch of friends to play with, and cross platform if you have xbox buddies. It can be a fun party night",1.0,Positive

1567,Party Animals,"Have I played much? No. However, If you're questioning to get party animals? I'd say go for it when its on discount. I got it for 9. and its hella worth it, if you're into the fornite type of layout with the store and shit, and a mix of gang beasts and adding Nemo kart is basically Mario kart 8 if you're into that.

1569,Party Animals,"This game is a delightful, chaotic, and lighthearted escape—perfect for when you're tired of overly competitive environments. 

It features adorable characters and party-style gameplay that anyone can jump into!
It’s not meant to be taken too seriously, but sometimes it feels like the player base hasn’t quite gotten that memo.

Seriously, people need to relax—this isn’t [i]League of Legends [/i].

That aside.. I absolutely recommend this game for anyone looking to have some lighthearted fun with friends. There are a few areas where improvements could be made, but the core experience is still a blast.

[hr][/hr]

[h1] Notes for the Developers: [/h1]
[u]Disable ""Everyone"" Voice Chat by Default:[/u]One of the key issues right now is the potential for harassment via voice chat. By default, all players can communicate with each other, and while that can sometimes lead to funny moments, it too often results in toxicity. I recommend turning off open voice chat by default, or at the very least limiting it to party members. It's a party game, but no one signed up for verbal abuse.

[u]Blocking Players on Corners:[/u]There’s a common issue where players block others in tight spaces or corners for entire rounds. It’s frustrating and feels like an exploit rather than a valid strategy. Introducing a timeout penalty for players who intentionally block others would make gameplay feel more balanced and fair for everyone.

[u]Visual Timer for Hazardous Areas (Fog/Lava/etc.):[/u] Some levels involve survival elements like fog or lava, where players must manage how long they can hold out. It would be great to have a visual timer or some indicator that shows exactly how long you can stay in these danger zones before your character is eliminated. This would make it easier for players to strategize and manage their moves more effectively.

[u]UI Accessibility and Highlighting in Menus:[/u] The UI while navigating menus with a controller is difficult to see, especially when it comes to highlighting menu options.

[u]Matchmaking Feels Unbalanced in Parties:[/u] While the game’s matchmaking system works well most of the time, it often feels like the balance shifts unfairly when playing in a party. As a casual player, I find myself frequently matched against players with 300+ hours of experience, which can be frustrating when all I want is to have fun with my friends. Some kind of skill-based matchmaking or balance adjustments for parties would help even out the playing field.",2.0,Positive
1570,Party Animals,only one person on a friend's pass can join a paid user's lobby. this isn't stated anywhere relevant and attempting to have a second user on a friend's pass join will fail and show an intentionally useless error code. also full of microtransactions and paid shop items. much better choices on the market,1.0,Negative
1571,Party Animals,"When Party Animals was first released a year ago, I thought it would follow the path of many similar games—enjoy a brief moment of popularity and then fade away, with little to no support from the developers. However, I'm pleased to say that I was completely wrong. A year later, Party Animals continues to receive regular content updates, keeping the game fresh and engaging for its players.

One of the most notable additions has been the new kart racing mode, which adds a fun and dynamic twist to the game’s chaotic multiplayer action. This mode, along with other new content, shows that the developers are committed to keeping the game alive and exciting.

In terms of gameplay, Party Animals excels within its genre. The controls are simple but effective, making it easy for players of all skill levels to jump in and have a good time. The physics-based combat is hilariously unpredictable, leading to countless laugh-out-loud moments as you and your friends wrestle, punch, and throw each other across the colorful maps.

Overall, Party Animals has proven to be more than just a flash in the pan. It's a well-crafted party game that has managed to maintain its charm and fun factor long after its initial release, thanks to the steady stream of updates and the dedication of its developers. Whether you're playing with friends or hopping into online matches, this game is a great choice for anyone looking for a lighthearted and entertaining experience.",4.0,Positive

1577,Party Animals,"Cheaters are running rampant, ruining match after match with speed hacks, invulnerability and other exploits that destroy any sense of fair play. What’s the point of a competitive brawler if one single player can dominate the entire lobby with hacks? I’ve reported so many, but the problem just keeps getting worse.

But here’s the kicker - rather than focusing on real anti-cheat measures, the devs decide to reintroduce macros that only help players automate and abuse the game mechanics. It’s like they’re actively encouraging people to find new ways to exploit the game.

It’s beyond frustrating that the devs aren't taking the community's feedback seriously. Instead of banning cheaters and tightening security, they’re just adding features that make the situation even more chaotic. Hopefully one day I can change my review to a positive one.",0.0,Negative

1600,Party Animals,"Long story short? 🤔
The game is fun and justifies its price (I’ve paid ~$6.5) — it has a really slick and nice UI, UX is decent enough, the gameplay is tons of fun and some modes/maps are hilarious 😂

There’s quite a variety of modes:
• Mario Kart alike gamemode
• Fighting maps
• Team based maps where you need to do various objectives (the most diversed mode)
• Smash Bros-esque 6 rounds fighting mode with roguelite (kinda) element!
• Also there’s a hub map (available only in Custom Modes) with 2 board games — one is, basically, UNO, but another one I didn’t try (needs more than 2 players).
• And so on…

My main gripe with the game is that Party Animals desperately needs more content — and I’m not talking about cosmetics, but maps and modes.

Currently, there’s quite little variety!

While the game is fun for the first time which you can prolong by playing a few maps per one time, but you will consume all the content pretty fast. Actually very fast. The game will last way longer if you have friends/family/partner, but it still won’t last long. Maybe a few weekends, tops.

The only solution I see is for the devs to drop one map/mode per month, at least.
Okay, maybe per two months, which is hilariously bad, but still something.

The game is paid but there’s such a huge amount of paid content, it’s baffling.

Like so many paid currencies!

Remember that hub map I’ve talked about? You can buy placeable stuff like swings and fireworks for ONE OF PAID CURRENCIES — and these placeables are CONSUMABLES, so they are not infinite. You can, somehow, earn this paid currency, but it’s very-very slow.

There’s an in-game currency (which you can still exchange to via main paid currency), but you cannot buy much stuff for it. There are even loot boxes. I’m okay-ish with them, however you get very little currency for said loot boxes — though you can pay real money to get them, of course.

Anyway, I wish the devs all the best, I really hope they will add more content reasonably fast.

If they implement some sort of map/mode builder, then it’ll be a banger for sure! 🔥

Well, that’s about it.

Message to the devs ✉️

“You are cooking a really good game, you already making something extremely fun and diverse — please continue making good stuff and do not abandon the game, neither flood it with microtransactions. Also, thanks a lot for the Friend’s Pass system — it’s amazing! We can invite one player for free and play with them in (almost?) all modes!”

P.S:

The game doesn’t have an offline mode (or so it seems). Please keep it in mind. I didn’t test local co-op, but, as far as I understand, it works. However, again, you need to have internet connection. I do not know any limitations of local co-op, but I do know that there’s split screen (not every map/mode has it!) and you can connect multiple controllers.

Hopefully someone will make a handler for this game for NucleusCOOP 💯",35.0,Positive

1602,Party Animals,"[quote=Party Animals] Paw it out with your friends remotely, or huddle together for chaotic fun on the same screen. [/quote]

Well. Apparently this only applies to a few game modes. At least at the moment you can't play many of them together on the same screen, such as racing. It's a kind of false advertising.

Hopefully this will change in the future.

1604,Party Animals,"Note: Sadly I've requested a refund for this game.

Party Animals is a great example of a brilliant concept held hostage to poor execution and restrictions.
Taking a lot of inspiration from the popular game 'Gang Beasts', Party Animals takes on the appearance of a sandbox-style physics based fighting game where the player chooses from a large number of avatars to do battle across a number of interactive environments as well as the recent inclusion of mario-kart style minigames.

Overall the game's appearance is charming, and well polished. Character models and variants are funny to play around with and the gameplay is close to identical to what I would expect from Gang Beasts.

Sadly the drawbacks and limitations on this game are its downfall.
It would seem that the game has been built heavily around touting cosmetic microtransactions. At the time of this review, about 75% of the Main Menu is overcrowded with panels pushing sales and discounts.
The biggest let down however is that this game requires a constant internet connection to function and provides a limited split-screen capability. The developers have stated that they have no plans to introduce an offline mode, a big mistake in my opinion.

Party Animals sadly falls short of its name, taking a brilliant easy-going sandbox button-masher and holding it hostage to requiring a constant internet connection to work and a reduced experience. Yet all this could be easily reversed by introducing the sandbox experience that made its predecessors a success.",11.0,Negative

fun party game with an incredibly friendly friend pass system, where only one person has to pay for the full game, enabling *one* friend per copy to use the friend pass and play the game for free!
through this system alone i have shown off this game to a many of my friends, resulting in them actually purchasing the game for themselves as they enjoyed it way more than they thought they would.
the friend pass gives ""barebones"" access to the game, needing the paying player to invite them, they do not have access to cosmetics nor achievements however these are not necessary for what is essentially a ""demo version"" of the game.

[b]Not recommend[/b] If you are not into the type of game that is just silly fun and nothing more. It takes skill to master the game tho with how the movement and how to place yourself infront of an enemy, but still most of the time it's considered a silly fun game in my opinion.",0.0,Positive
1648,Party Animals,"For the most part the game is fun.

But it has the most inconsistent damage. It seems like you'll throw 30 punches and nothing happens, but then the person you're fighting throws one and you're out cold for for the next 3-5 business days. Just long enough for them to pick you up and throw you off the arena, but don't worry you'll wake up the second they throw you so you can flail your way down.

I'd recommend this to play with your friends. But if you play online solo, expect to carry your team.

Wish they'd hide unobtainable cosmetics as well.",0.0,Negative
1649,Party Animals,"This game is great fun for the price it comes with. The developers seem nice and eager to add updates according to the community's feedback. It's got some lovely optimization, with quite a few stuff to do across different categories of modes. Servers work all the time and overall it's a great experience. Hopefully, they can add even more stuff as time goes by, since this game is only 1yrs old, at the time of this review.

1654,Party Animals,"Looking around on social media the game immediately had my attention because of how funny the videos were. Playing it now... Yeah. It still is funny. 

Skins (in my opinion) are easy to get if you're doing quick matches. I was looking around on forums about why I wasn't getting a lot of XP for the Dogs VS Cats event and you need to play quick matches for more. And when I say more, I mean A LOT more. There is a cap on how many bucks you get (with the leveling up system) which confuses me? There's probably a ton of skins from what I've seen and there's no real reason to have a leveling cap for that. Unless we can get the skins a different way. I don't know though, I got it a few days ago. (There's also some cool looking skins so wth)

Game modes are fine for the most part. I can cycle through without getting bored. But I agree that we do need an offline mode. I can't play Nemo Kart without my kart stopping multiple times (due to my horrendous ping). Every other game seems to play good though. And quick match adds on to those so you can't get bored while playing. 

Quick match is easy, but seems to be a more competitive option to custom games. I'm guessing this was set up to help with the pass and the Dogs VS Cats update. It's not a bad thing, it's just odd to have a competitive style in a party game. I would just suggest making getting XP in custom games easier, since you barely get anything for that compared to quick matches. Some people don't want to be competitive and grind everyday just to get a common skin, or from what I've heard a duplicate. (I don't know if the duplicate part is true though.) So far I've had no problems with this though. It gives me something to compete for.

The transactions are not much of an issue. You have to make profit somehow. Just make currency easier to get. More specifically the Nemo Bucks. Since there is a cap on the level apparently? (I still could be wrong about this so if anyone even reads this can you correct me lmao) But just from playing you get the currency to get skins. So not much of an issue to me. The one problem I do have is the XP you get from custom matches. Well, the XP for the factions rather. You barely get anything for it in custom matches.

This one mightttt be on me but the lag. The input lag is INSANE if you have a high ping. This might be on me again but I had to sit through a full day wondering why I've been getting horrible input lag. It's probably your ping. I see why people want an offline mode now.

Overall, the game isn't bad. I would recommend playing it if you just want to have fun with some friends. Apparently split-screen doesn't work but I don't have to reason to play split-screen. Just make an offline mode and I'm good. :P",0.0,Positive

1657,Party Animals,"One of the best party games out there at the moment, i always wanted to buy it but did not because it had no friend pass available last time i saw which meant that every one of my friend would have had to purchase it to play with me, but i luckily stumbled upon this games page 2 days ago and saw the friend pass thing and searched about it and boy i was so happy now only i had to buy it and i can invite my friends to play with me for free Friend Pass is one of the best decision the developers have ever made. This game is super fun with friends and the kart mode is a great addition to i hope the devs keep improving it and adding new modes to this GOAT game. well i only have one issue with this game and that is that it does not support local offline co op like the old gangbeast(beta) versions did if they add local offline co op then this GAME WILL BE THE BEST PARTY GAME OF ALL TIME.

1658,Party Animals,"One of the best party games i have ever played. Beat up your friends and family in spectacular fashion by throwing bombs, hitting them with a shovel, punching them in the face, smacking them or yourself with nunchucks or tasing them with a taser. Do all of this while looking like the most adorable little evil menace that you can customize to your liking. 

Had enough of the team beatup game for a bit? Try the coop pirate mode where you have to fend of a bunch of pirates with your friends or maybe try one of the team game modes like football, hockey or american football. Looking for something different than smashing enemies? Maybe the winter cabin mode is better for you with a bunch of cozy activities and card games. Feeling more like playing a certain kart racer, but dont want to go through the hazzle of paying for another game? Try Nemo Kart (its also in this game)!

Other note worthy stuff:
- Game requires a consistent internet connection, there is no offline mode (yet).
- You can invite a friend along without them having to pay for the game.
- Cosmetics in the game are 99.9% obtainable with in game currencies or through events, exceptions are certain collab skins. 
- All the event passes (battle passes) have been completely free up til now.
- The game updates consistantly.

1661,Party Animals,"I'll be honest..

I have spent far more time on this game over the last week + since buying it than I probably should have. Any time I have had free time, this game has taken priority because, as frustrating as it can be when things don't go the way you wanted them to, it's so darn silly and such good fun it's hard NOT to want to play it. Subtract about 6 - 8 hours at a guess from leaving the game running whilst AFK, and that's the genuine playtime.

[b]Let's talk about this awesome little game and it's modes.[/b]

[b]Classic :[/b] Last-Team Standing, with sports based and objective modes, all of the fun stuff.
[b]Smash :[/b] Pure combat. Every round, pick a card based power up and win points over six rounds.
[b]Nemo Kart :[/b] Kart-racing. More or less a carbon-copy of MK and a mid one at that.

Classic is, for me, the ideal, go-to mode. You have your combat maps, you have maps designed around securing objectives whilst fighting and you have maps designed around fighting and playing sports.

SMASH is, okay? If you like pure combat and no real objectives, this one is great as it'll rotate maps between rounds as you secure power-ups. Comeback potential is there as later rounds afford more points.

Nemo Kart is not that good. No reason to play it over other well designed alternatives really. It's there, but I think the developers should focus on other things, it's sub-par to me.

[b]The juicy stuff, how's the combat?[/b]

It's goofy, physics based, doesn't always go the way you expect it nor want it to, but even when it's frustrating, it's grand. I'd be lying if I said I haven't had mid-game mini-rants, arguing as to why I'm knocked out longer after a single punch than someone who I've KO'd three times for example, but even when it's frustrating, it can be funny and oh so enjoyable.

There isn't much complexity to it, knowledge comes more down to timing than anything else. You have a punch / sprint punch, kick / drop-kick and a headbutt / roll. You can obviously grab too. The grabbing is based more on proximity of where your arms are, rather than you having control of each arm, punches will be carried by momentum, headbutts aided by your ability to grab people and drop kicks are either super intentional or super random.

[b]So, what about progression and monetisation?[/b]

Right now, there's a free battle pass event going on, I'm unaware of previous passes. Upon purchase of the game, you'll also progress a 100-tier track through normal play and normal XP gain, of which you'll get multiple currencies and cosmetics. Cookies are given out very fairly, many shop skins can be bought with those, NEMO bucks given out more sparingly, but enough to use on the gacha system to test your luck if you wish and they also throw egg coins at you for the gacha system too, so you have a chance to unlock things always, without buying into MTX.

[b]So, should you buy it?[/b]

See if you have a mate that owns it first, ask them if they're willing to invite you and let you try via the friend pass and give it a go. If not, it's fairly affordable for what it is and I think monetisation contrasted with the progression you get is more than fair in this day and age.

I think it's worth every penny personally. I've loved it, I encouraged my kids to play it with me and we've laughed at it, I've had a few funny session with my wife on it too and I've even played it with some of my good mates as well and it's been top-notch every time, even when I get frustrated.

Great, adorable little game.",5.0,Positive
1662,Party Animals,"Party Animals follows the same footsteps as party fighter/combat games like Rubber Bandits, Gang Beasts and Super Smash Bros. Where you are fighting as minature version as animals. The game itself is a blast to play with friends with a good variety selection of maps to play on. There is also additional game modes to choose from appart from the regular fighting gameplay. The sound effects is also a nice touch from a freezing snow blizzard to wind blasting past your character while walking on the wingtips of a airplane makes it a even more nerve wracking experience than anticipated while fighting out for glory against your friends. To put it simple, this is a combat game similar to Gang Beasts, but with way better graphics and simpler gameplay. So no need to be button mashing 20-30 times to acheive your wanted commands for your character.

1669,Party Animals,"This game is a delightful, chaotic, and lighthearted escape—perfect for when you're tired of overly competitive environments. 

It features adorable characters and party-style gameplay that anyone can jump into!
It’s not meant to be taken too seriously, but sometimes it feels like the player base hasn’t quite gotten that memo.

Seriously, people need to relax—this isn’t [i]League of Legends [/i].

That aside.. I absolutely recommend this game for anyone looking to have some lighthearted fun with friends. There are a few areas where improvements could be made, but the core experience is still a blast.

[hr][/hr]

[h1] Notes for the Developers: [/h1]
[u]Disable ""Everyone"" Voice Chat by Default:[/u]One of the key issues right now is the potential for harassment via voice chat. By default, all players can communicate with each other, and while that can sometimes lead to funny moments, it too often results in toxicity. I recommend turning off open voice chat by default, or at the very least limiting it to party members. It's a party game, but no one signed up for verbal abuse.

[u]Blocking Players on Corners:[/u]There’s a common issue where players block others in tight spaces or corners for entire rounds. It’s frustrating and feels like an exploit rather than a valid strategy. Introducing a timeout penalty for players who intentionally block others would make gameplay feel more balanced and fair for everyone.

[u]Visual Timer for Hazardous Areas (Fog/Lava/etc.):[/u] Some levels involve survival elements like fog or lava, where players must manage how long they can hold out. It would be great to have a visual timer or some indicator that shows exactly how long you can stay in these danger zones before your character is eliminated. This would make it easier for players to strategize and manage their moves more effectively.

[u]UI Accessibility and Highlighting in Menus:[/u] The UI while navigating menus with a controller is difficult to see, especially when it comes to highlighting menu options.

[u]Matchmaking Feels Unbalanced in Parties:[/u] While the game’s matchmaking system works well most of the time, it often feels like the balance shifts unfairly when playing in a party. As a casual player, I find myself frequently matched against players with 300+ hours of experience, which can be frustrating when all I want is to have fun with my friends. Some kind of skill-based matchmaking or balance adjustments for parties would help even out the playing field.",2.0,Positive
1670,Party Animals,only one person on a friend's pass can join a paid user's lobby. this isn't stated anywhere relevant and attempting to have a second user on a friend's pass join will fail and show an intentionally useless error code. also full of microtransactions and paid shop items. much better choices on the market,1.0,Negative
1671,Party Animals,"When Party Animals was first released a year ago, I thought it would follow the path of many similar games—enjoy a brief moment of popularity and then fade away, with little to no support from the developers. However, I'm pleased to say that I was completely wrong. A year later, Party Animals continues to receive regular content updates, keeping the game fresh and engaging for its players.

One of the most notable additions has been the new kart racing mode, which adds a fun and dynamic twist to the game’s chaotic multiplayer action. This mode, along with other new content, shows that the developers are committed to keeping the game alive and exciting.

In terms of gameplay, Party Animals excels within its genre. The controls are simple but effective, making it easy for players of all skill levels to jump in and have a good time. The physics-based combat is hilariously unpredictable, leading to countless laugh-out-loud moments as you and your friends wrestle, punch, and throw each other across the colorful maps.

Overall, Party Animals has proven to be more than just a flash in the pan. It's a well-crafted party game that has managed to maintain its charm and fun factor long after its initial release, thanks to the steady stream of updates and the dedication of its developers. Whether you're playing with friends or hopping into online matches, this game is a great choice for anyone looking for a lighthearted and entertaining experience.",4.0,Positive

What’s the point of a competitive brawler if one single player can dominate the entire lobby with hacks? I’ve reported so many, but the problem just keeps getting worse.

But here’s the kicker - rather than focusing on real anti-cheat measures, the devs decide to reintroduce macros that only help players automate and abuse the game mechanics. It’s like they’re actively encouraging people to find new ways to exploit the game.

It’s beyond frustrating that the devs aren't taking the community's feedback seriously. Instead of banning cheaters and tightening security, they’re just adding features that make the situation even more chaotic. Hopefully one day I can change my review to a positive one.",0.0,Negative

1700,Party Animals,"Long story short? 🤔
The game is fun and justifies its price (I’ve paid ~$6.5) — it has a really slick and nice UI, UX is decent enough, the gameplay is tons of fun and some modes/maps are hilarious 😂

There’s quite a variety of modes:
• Mario Kart alike gamemode
• Fighting maps
• Team based maps where you need to do various objectives (the most diversed mode)
• Smash Bros-esque 6 rounds fighting mode with roguelite (kinda) element!
• Also there’s a hub map (available only in Custom Modes) with 2 board games — one is, basically, UNO, but another one I didn’t try (needs more than 2 players).
• And so on…

My main gripe with the game is that Party Animals desperately needs more content — and I’m not talking about cosmetics, but maps and modes.

Currently, there’s quite little variety!

While the game is fun for the first time which you can prolong by playing a few maps per one time, but you will consume all the content pretty fast. Actually very fast. The game will last way longer if you have friends/family/partner, but it still won’t last long. Maybe a few weekends, tops.

The only solution I see is for the devs to drop one map/mode per month, at least.
Okay, maybe per two months, which is hilariously bad, but still something.

The game is paid but there’s such a huge amount of paid content, it’s baffling.

Like so many paid currencies!

Remember that hub map I’ve talked about? You can buy placeable stuff like swings and fireworks for ONE OF PAID CURRENCIES — and these placeables are CONSUMABLES, so they are not infinite. You can, somehow, earn this paid currency, but it’s very-very slow.

There’s an in-game currency (which you can still exchange to via main paid currency), but you cannot buy much stuff for it. There are even loot boxes. I’m okay-ish with them, however you get very little currency for said loot boxes — though you can pay real money to get them, of course.

Anyway, I wish the devs all the best, I really hope they will add more content reasonably fast.

If they implement some sort of map/mode builder, then it’ll be a banger for sure! 🔥

Well, that’s about it.

Message to the devs ✉️

“You are cooking a really good game, you already making something extremely fun and diverse — please continue making good stuff and do not abandon the game, neither flood it with microtransactions. Also, thanks a lot for the Friend’s Pass system — it’s amazing! We can invite one player for free and play with them in (almost?) all modes!”

P.S:

The game doesn’t have an offline mode (or so it seems). Please keep it in mind. I didn’t test local co-op, but, as far as I understand, it works. However, again, you need to have internet connection. I do not know any limitations of local co-op, but I do know that there’s split screen (not every map/mode has it!) and you can connect multiple controllers.

Hopefully this will change in the future.

1704,Party Animals,"Note: Sadly I've requested a refund for this game.

Party Animals is a great example of a brilliant concept held hostage to poor execution and restrictions.
Taking a lot of inspiration from the popular game 'Gang Beasts', Party Animals takes on the appearance of a sandbox-style physics based fighting game where the player chooses from a large number of avatars to do battle across a number of interactive environments as well as the recent inclusion of mario-kart style minigames.

Overall the game's appearance is charming, and well polished. Character models and variants are funny to play around with and the gameplay is close to identical to what I would expect from Gang Beasts.

Sadly the drawbacks and limitations on this game are its downfall.
It would seem that the game has been built heavily around touting cosmetic microtransactions. At the time of this review, about 75% of the Main Menu is overcrowded with panels pushing sales and discounts.
The biggest let down however is that this game requires a constant internet connection to function and provides a limited split-screen capability. The developers have stated that they have no plans to introduce an offline mode, a big mistake in my opinion.

Party Animals sadly falls short of its name, taking a brilliant easy-going sandbox button-masher and holding it hostage to requiring a constant internet connection to work and a reduced experience. Yet all this could be easily reversed by introducing the sandbox experience that made its predecessors a success.",11.0,Negative

1716,Party Animals,"""gang beasts but better"" to put it simply;
fun party game with an incredibly friendly friend pass system, where only one person has to pay for the full game, enabling *one* friend per copy to use the friend pass and play the game for free!
through this system alone i have shown off this game to a many of my friends, resulting in them actually purchasing the game for themselves as they enjoyed it way more than they thought they would.
the friend pass gives ""barebones"" access to the game, needing the paying player to invite them, they do not have access to cosmetics nor achievements however these are not necessary for what is essentially a ""demo version"" of the game.

the game is fun, give it a go, or ask one of your friends who have already paid for it if you can mooch off of them.",0.0,Positive

1754,Party Animals,"Looking around on social media the game immediately had my attention because of how funny the videos were. Playing it now... Yeah. It still is funny. 

Skins (in my opinion) are easy to get if you're doing quick matches. I was looking around on forums about why I wasn't getting a lot of XP for the Dogs VS Cats event and you need to play quick matches for more. And when I say more, I mean A LOT more. There is a cap on how many bucks you get (with the leveling up system) which confuses me? There's probably a ton of skins from what I've seen and there's no real reason to have a leveling cap for that. Unless we can get the skins a different way. I don't know though, I got it a few days ago. (There's also some cool looking skins so wth)

Game modes are fine for the most part. I can cycle through without getting bored. But I agree that we do need an offline mode. I can't play Nemo Kart without my kart stopping multiple times (due to my horrendous ping). Every other game seems to play good though. And quick match adds on to those so you can't get bored while playing. 

Quick match is easy, but seems to be a more competitive option to custom games. I'm guessing this was set up to help with the pass and the Dogs VS Cats update. It's not a bad thing, it's just odd to have a competitive style in a party game. I would just suggest making getting XP in custom games easier, since you barely get anything for that compared to quick matches. Some people don't want to be competitive and grind everyday just to get a common skin, or from what I've heard a duplicate. (I don't know if the duplicate part is true though.) So far I've had no problems with this though. It gives me something to compete for.

The transactions are not much of an issue. You have to make profit somehow. Just make currency easier to get. More specifically the Nemo Bucks. Since there is a cap on the level apparently? (I still could be wrong about this so if anyone even reads this can you correct me lmao) But just from playing you get the currency to get skins. So not much of an issue to me. The one problem I do have is the XP you get from custom matches. Well, the XP for the factions rather. You barely get anything for it in custom matches.

This one mightttt be on me but the lag. The input lag is INSANE if you have a high ping. This might be on me again but I had to sit through a full day wondering why I've been getting horrible input lag. It's probably your ping. I see why people want an offline mode now.

Overall, the game isn't bad. I would recommend playing it if you just want to have fun with some friends. Apparently split-screen doesn't work but I don't have to reason to play split-screen. Just make an offline mode and I'm good. :P",0.0,Positive

This game is super fun with friends and the kart mode is a great addition to i hope the devs keep improving it and adding new modes to this GOAT game. well i only have one issue with this game and that is that it does not support local offline co op like the old gangbeast(beta) versions did if they add local offline co op then this GAME WILL BE THE BEST PARTY GAME OF ALL TIME.

1758,Party Animals,"One of the best party games i have ever played.

Do all of this while looking like the most adorable little evil menace that you can customize to your liking. 

Had enough of the team beatup game for a bit? Try the coop pirate mode where you have to fend of a bunch of pirates with your friends or maybe try one of the team game modes like football, hockey or american football. Looking for something different than smashing enemies? Maybe the winter cabin mode is better for you with a bunch of cozy activities and card games. Feeling more like playing a certain kart racer, but dont want to go through the hazzle of paying for another game? Try Nemo Kart (its also in this game)!

Other note worthy stuff:
- Game requires a consistent internet connection, there is no offline mode (yet).
- You can invite a friend along without them having to pay for the game.
- Cosmetics in the game are 99.9% obtainable with in game currencies or through events, exceptions are certain collab skins. 
- All the event passes (battle passes) have been completely free up til now.

1761,Party Animals,"I'll be honest..

I have spent far more time on this game over the last week + since buying it than I probably should have. Any time I have had free time, this game has taken priority because, as frustrating as it can be when things don't go the way you wanted them to, it's so darn silly and such good fun it's hard NOT to want to play it. Subtract about 6 - 8 hours at a guess from leaving the game running whilst AFK, and that's the genuine playtime.

[b]Let's talk about this awesome little game and it's modes.[/b]

[b]Classic :[/b] Last-Team Standing, with sports based and objective modes, all of the fun stuff.
[b]Smash :[/b] Pure combat. Every round, pick a card based power up and win points over six rounds.
[b]Nemo Kart :[/b] Kart-racing. More or less a carbon-copy of MK and a mid one at that.

Classic is, for me, the ideal, go-to mode. You have your combat maps, you have maps designed around securing objectives whilst fighting and you have maps designed around fighting and playing sports.

SMASH is, okay? If you like pure combat and no real objectives, this one is great as it'll rotate maps between rounds as you secure power-ups. Comeback potential is there as later rounds afford more points.

Nemo Kart is not that good. No reason to play it over other well designed alternatives really. It's there, but I think the developers should focus on other things, it's sub-par to me.

[b]The juicy stuff, how's the combat?[/b]

It's goofy, physics based, doesn't always go the way you expect it nor want it to, but even when it's frustrating, it's grand. I'd be lying if I said I haven't had mid-game mini-rants, arguing as to why I'm knocked out longer after a single punch than someone who I've KO'd three times for example, but even when it's frustrating, it can be funny and oh so enjoyable.

There isn't much complexity to it, knowledge comes more down to timing than anything else. You have a punch / sprint punch, kick / drop-kick and a headbutt / roll. You can obviously grab too. The grabbing is based more on proximity of where your arms are, rather than you having control of each arm, punches will be carried by momentum, headbutts aided by your ability to grab people and drop kicks are either super intentional or super random.

[b]So, what about progression and monetisation?[/b]

Right now, there's a free battle pass event going on, I'm unaware of previous passes. Upon purchase of the game, you'll also progress a 100-tier track through normal play and normal XP gain, of which you'll get multiple currencies and cosmetics. Cookies are given out very fairly, many shop skins can be bought with those, NEMO bucks given out more sparingly, but enough to use on the gacha system to test your luck if you wish and they also throw egg coins at you for the gacha system too, so you have a chance to unlock things always, without buying into MTX.

[b]So, should you buy it?[/b]

See if you have a mate that owns it first, ask them if they're willing to invite you and let you try via the friend pass and give it a go. If not, it's fairly affordable for what it is and I think monetisation contrasted with the progression you get is more than fair in this day and age.

I think it's worth every penny personally. I've loved it, I encouraged my kids to play it with me and we've laughed at it, I've had a few funny session with my wife on it too and I've even played it with some of my good mates as well and it's been top-notch every time, even when I get frustrated.

Great, adorable little game.",5.0,Positive
1762,Party Animals,"Party Animals follows the same footsteps as party fighter/combat games like Rubber Bandits, Gang Beasts and Super Smash Bros. Where you are fighting as minature version as animals. The game itself is a blast to play with friends with a good variety selection of maps to play on. There is also additional game modes to choose from appart from the regular fighting gameplay. The sound effects is also a nice touch from a freezing snow blizzard to wind blasting past your character while walking on the wingtips of a airplane makes it a even more nerve wracking experience than anticipated while fighting out for glory against your friends. To put it simple, this is a combat game similar to Gang Beasts, but with way better graphics and simpler gameplay. So no need to be button mashing 20-30 times to acheive your wanted commands for your character.

1769,Party Animals,"This game is a delightful, chaotic, and lighthearted escape—perfect for when you're tired of overly competitive environments. 

It features adorable characters and party-style gameplay that anyone can jump into!
It’s not meant to be taken too seriously, but sometimes it feels like the player base hasn’t quite gotten that memo.

Seriously, people need to relax—this isn’t [i]League of Legends [/i].

That aside.. I absolutely recommend this game for anyone looking to have some lighthearted fun with friends. There are a few areas where improvements could be made, but the core experience is still a blast.

[hr][/hr]

[h1] Notes for the Developers: [/h1]
[u]Disable ""Everyone"" Voice Chat by Default:[/u]One of the key issues right now is the potential for harassment via voice chat. By default, all players can communicate with each other, and while that can sometimes lead to funny moments, it too often results in toxicity. I recommend turning off open voice chat by default, or at the very least limiting it to party members. It's a party game, but no one signed up for verbal abuse.

[u]Blocking Players on Corners:[/u]There’s a common issue where players block others in tight spaces or corners for entire rounds. It’s frustrating and feels like an exploit rather than a valid strategy. Introducing a timeout penalty for players who intentionally block others would make gameplay feel more balanced and fair for everyone.

[u]Visual Timer for Hazardous Areas (Fog/Lava/etc.):[/u] Some levels involve survival elements like fog or lava, where players must manage how long they can hold out. It would be great to have a visual timer or some indicator that shows exactly how long you can stay in these danger zones before your character is eliminated. This would make it easier for players to strategize and manage their moves more effectively.

[u]UI Accessibility and Highlighting in Menus:[/u] The UI while navigating menus with a controller is difficult to see, especially when it comes to highlighting menu options.

[u]Matchmaking Feels Unbalanced in Parties:[/u] While the game’s matchmaking system works well most of the time, it often feels like the balance shifts unfairly when playing in a party. As a casual player, I find myself frequently matched against players with 300+ hours of experience, which can be frustrating when all I want is to have fun with my friends. Some kind of skill-based matchmaking or balance adjustments for parties would help even out the playing field.",2.0,Positive
1770,Party Animals,only one person on a friend's pass can join a paid user's lobby. this isn't stated anywhere relevant and attempting to have a second user on a friend's pass join will fail and show an intentionally useless error code. also full of microtransactions and paid shop items. much better choices on the market,1.0,Negative
1771,Party Animals,"When Party Animals was first released a year ago, I thought it would follow the path of many similar games—enjoy a brief moment of popularity and then fade away, with little to no support from the developers. However, I'm pleased to say that I was completely wrong. A year later, Party Animals continues to receive regular content updates, keeping the game fresh and engaging for its players.

One of the most notable additions has been the new kart racing mode, which adds a fun and dynamic twist to the game’s chaotic multiplayer action. This mode, along with other new content, shows that the developers are committed to keeping the game alive and exciting.

In terms of gameplay, Party Animals excels within its genre. The controls are simple but effective, making it easy for players of all skill levels to jump in and have a good time. The physics-based combat is hilariously unpredictable, leading to countless laugh-out-loud moments as you and your friends wrestle, punch, and throw each other across the colorful maps.

Overall, Party Animals has proven to be more than just a flash in the pan. It's a well-crafted party game that has managed to maintain its charm and fun factor long after its initial release, thanks to the steady stream of updates and the dedication of its developers. Whether you're playing with friends or hopping into online matches, this game is a great choice for anyone looking for a lighthearted and entertaining experience.",4.0,Positive
1772,Party Animals,Super fun game with fun mechanics. modes. great skins. and probably the best to play with friends just for fun! I can tell that sometimes I will spend hours just playing alone too.,0.0,Positive
1773,Party Animals,"It's gang beasts but better imo.

Not knocking on the og though cause i dont think this game would exist without it.

Has functional quickplay so you dont necessarily need friends, and if you do have a friend who is willing to play you can invite 1 guest to play with the Guest Pass",0.0,Positive
1774,Party Animals,"Paid game with microtransactions = no reccommend from me

1777,Party Animals,"Cheaters are running rampant, ruining match after match with speed hacks, invulnerability and other exploits that destroy any sense of fair play. What’s the point of a competitive brawler if one single player can dominate the entire lobby with hacks? I’ve reported so many, but the problem just keeps getting worse.

But here’s the kicker - rather than focusing on real anti-cheat measures, the devs decide to reintroduce macros that only help players automate and abuse the game mechanics. It’s like they’re actively encouraging people to find new ways to exploit the game.

It’s beyond frustrating that the devs aren't taking the community's feedback seriously. Instead of banning cheaters and tightening security, they’re just adding features that make the situation even more chaotic. Hopefully one day I can change my review to a positive one.",0.0,Negative

Until they fix this, i can NOT give this game a positive review. I thought this game was fun, just to be met with me not being allowed to play, thanks developers.
Edit: The game seems to have fixed itself the next day on, i'm now led to believe it might have been a connection issue of sorts, server or player wise. It lags and bugs out here and there now, but no major issues anymore for me.",0.0,Positive

1801,PICO PARK,"Cannot recommend this game enough. This and the second game (I would play 1 first.) Strap yourself in for a ride.

Easy synonyms for Pico Park 1 and 2 include ""Mental Devolution Simulator"", ""Anger Issues Simulator"" and ""Monkey Tribe Simulator."" On the surface, the games are simple. Cute kitty platformers with a few worlds, many levels, runs well and are very light (first game is less than 80MB big). So what could be the issue? Well as Darwin would put it, ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives. It is the one that FUCKING PRESSES THE SPACEBAR YOU APE PIECE OF SHIT.""

See, the game's worlds are fully cooperative. Every single level requires cooperation and teamwork to get through, and the level is only done when every single player gets to the end. This means that teamwork is a MUST. However, you can't walk through other players; in fact you can bump into them and accidentally lock them in place or block their jumps. And since all players MUST get to the end, one person screwing up fucks everything up. Add to that the fact one player dying in some levels is a total restart, and that you can play with up to 7 other monkeys that need to coordinate their moves (which can be very 'difficult' for kindergarteners and engineers with PhDs alike) and you realize humans can in fact degenerate their brains back into peas you want to rip out of their heads.

This game blew up in Brazil and I swear, its amazing. For the best experience: it can be played with anywhere from 2 to 8 people but the more the merrier, at least 6 is already great. Friends (not strangers), voice chat and a willingness to return to monke and blow your vocal chords are best. 

I played through the whole thing twice, had the pleasure of being doubled over pissing myself from laughter while my brother almost tore his lung open yelling into his mic at once and then having a heart attack because of the amoebas I played with the next. If your group is, for some reason, 'good', it'll be a chill and quick game, but if its not (and it likely won't be), get ready to question why you want to kill your friends, and why you haven't mailed one a pipebomb yet. Almost every single person I've seen play this with a 6-or-more group has had a mental breakdown and/or rolled over their friends with a cement truck, too. Reading the reviews for Pico Park (especially 1, which has a lot more reviews) on Steam is a good way to die laughing at others' misery. The first game is short, but its a good introduction to Hell so you can get ready for the 2nd, which has more content.

2000,PICO PARK,If  you would like to scream at friends until you rage quit I'd absolutely reccommend this game. It's simple but in the most frustrating ways with multiple players. A great time truly,11.0,Positive
2001,PICO PARK,"Cannot recommend this game enough. This and the second game (I would play 1 first.) Strap yourself in for a ride.

Easy synonyms for Pico Park 1 and 2 include ""Mental Devolution Simulator"", ""Anger Issues Simulator"" and ""Monkey Tribe Simulator."" On the surface, the games are simple. Cute kitty platformers with a few worlds, many levels, runs well and are very light (first game is less than 80MB big). So what could be the issue? Well as Darwin would put it, ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives. It is the one that FUCKING PRESSES THE SPACEBAR YOU APE PIECE OF SHIT.""

See, the game's worlds are fully cooperative. Every single level requires cooperation and teamwork to get through, and the level is only done when every single player gets to the end. This means that teamwork is a MUST. However, you can't walk through other players; in fact you can bump into them and accidentally lock them in place or block their jumps. And since all players MUST get to the end, one person screwing up fucks everything up. Add to that the fact one player dying in some levels is a total restart, and that you can play with up to 7 other monkeys that need to coordinate their moves (which can be very 'difficult' for kindergarteners and engineers with PhDs alike) and you realize humans can in fact degenerate their brains back into peas you want to rip out of their heads.

This game blew up in Brazil and I swear, its amazing. For the best experience: it can be played with anywhere from 2 to 8 people but the more the merrier, at least 6 is already great. Friends (not strangers), voice chat and a willingness to return to monke and blow your vocal chords are best. 

I played through the whole thing twice, had the pleasure of being doubled over pissing myself from laughter while my brother almost tore his lung open yelling into his mic at once and then having a heart attack because of the amoebas I played with the next. If your group is, for some reason, 'good', it'll be a chill and quick game, but if its not (and it likely won't be), get ready to question why you want to kill your friends, and why you haven't mailed one a pipebomb yet. Almost every single person I've seen play this with a 6-or-more group has had a mental breakdown and/or rolled over their friends with a cement truck, too. Reading the reviews for Pico Park (especially 1, which has a lot more reviews) on Steam is a good way to die laughing at others' misery. The first game is short, but its a good introduction to Hell so you can get ready for the 2nd, which has more content.

As always, if your relationship - whether friendship or 20-year-long marriage - can survive Pico Park, it can survive anything.",1.0,Positive

Great game, cheap price, small download size, catchy music, cute designs, and a chaotic gameplay loop that because of the cute charm is always more funny than frustrating.

Due to that one such illusive cop player in a lobby is enough, your chances of getting a fair and fun lobby are minimal. The choice for lobbies is already between one and two active ones at best.",2.0,Negative

2110,Perfect Heist 2,"### Perfect Heist 2 - Review

**Rating:** ★★★★☆ (4/5)

**Introduction:**
""Perfect Heist 2"" is a multiplayer heist game that emphasizes strategy, cooperation, and a bit of deception. Developed by the indie team at ""The Perfect Heist Team,"" it offers a unique twist on the classic heist formula, allowing players to either assume the role of thieves planning the perfect heist or the cops trying to thwart them. Here’s an in-depth look at what makes ""Perfect Heist 2"" engaging, along with some areas for improvement.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- **Asymmetrical Gameplay:** The game features two distinct roles: thieves and police. Thieves must strategize and execute their heist while managing resources, while police must anticipate and counter their moves. This dynamic creates a tense and engaging experience.
- **Heist Planning and Execution:** Thieves have the freedom to plan their heists creatively, using various tools and gadgets to bypass security measures. This encourages players to think strategically and adapt to the unfolding situation.

---

**Visuals and Sound Design:**
- **Art Style:** The game features a stylized, minimalist aesthetic that keeps the focus on gameplay. The clean design and vibrant colors enhance the experience without overwhelming players.
- **Soundtrack:** The background music complements the gameplay, building tension during heist moments while remaining unobtrusive. Sound effects are effective, adding to the immersion during both planning and action phases.

---

**Multiplayer Experience:**
- **Cooperative Play:** The game thrives in its multiplayer setup, where teamwork is crucial for success. Communicating and coordinating with teammates adds depth to the gameplay, creating memorable moments.
- **Player Interaction:** The interactions between thieves and police can lead to humorous and unpredictable scenarios, making each match feel unique.

---

**Community and Content:**
- **Variety of Maps:** ""Perfect Heist 2"" features multiple maps with different layouts and challenges. Each map requires players to adapt their strategies, ensuring that gameplay remains fresh.
- **Regular Updates:** The developers have shown a commitment to improving the game, with updates that address player feedback and introduce new content, which keeps the community engaged.

---

**Critiques:**
- **Learning Curve:** New players may find the mechanics and strategies somewhat complex at first. A more structured tutorial or guide could help ease newcomers into the game.
- **Balance Issues:** Occasionally, the balance between thieves and police can feel off, depending on the map and player experience. Some matches may lean heavily in favor of one side, which can be frustrating.

---

**Conclusion:**
""Perfect Heist 2"" successfully combines strategy, teamwork, and a lighthearted approach to heists. Its asymmetrical gameplay offers a fresh take on the genre, encouraging players to think creatively and work closely with teammates. While there are some learning curves and balance issues, the overall experience is enjoyable and engaging.

If you’re looking for a fun, cooperative multiplayer game that emphasizes strategy and teamwork, ""Perfect Heist 2"" is highly recommended. It’s a great choice for players seeking both challenge and humor in their gaming experience.

**Overall Recommendation:** A solid pick for fans of multiplayer strategy games and those looking for a unique heist experience.",0.0,Positive

2325,Perfect Heist 2,"### Perfect Heist 2 - Review

**Rating:** ★★★★☆ (4/5)

**Introduction:**
""Perfect Heist 2"" is a multiplayer heist game that emphasizes strategy, cooperation, and a bit of deception. Developed by the indie team at ""The Perfect Heist Team,"" it offers a unique twist on the classic heist formula, allowing players to either assume the role of thieves planning the perfect heist or the cops trying to thwart them. Here’s an in-depth look at what makes ""Perfect Heist 2"" engaging, along with some areas for improvement.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- **Asymmetrical Gameplay:** The game features two distinct roles: thieves and police. Thieves must strategize and execute their heist while managing resources, while police must anticipate and counter their moves. This dynamic creates a tense and engaging experience.
- **Heist Planning and Execution:** Thieves have the freedom to plan their heists creatively, using various tools and gadgets to bypass security measures. This encourages players to think strategically and adapt to the unfolding situation.

---

**Visuals and Sound Design:**
- **Art Style:** The game features a stylized, minimalist aesthetic that keeps the focus on gameplay. The clean design and vibrant colors enhance the experience without overwhelming players.
- **Soundtrack:** The background music complements the gameplay, building tension during heist moments while remaining unobtrusive. Sound effects are effective, adding to the immersion during both planning and action phases.

---

**Multiplayer Experience:**
- **Cooperative Play:** The game thrives in its multiplayer setup, where teamwork is crucial for success. Communicating and coordinating with teammates adds depth to the gameplay, creating memorable moments.
- **Player Interaction:** The interactions between thieves and police can lead to humorous and unpredictable scenarios, making each match feel unique.

---

**Community and Content:**
- **Variety of Maps:** ""Perfect Heist 2"" features multiple maps with different layouts and challenges. Each map requires players to adapt their strategies, ensuring that gameplay remains fresh.
- **Regular Updates:** The developers have shown a commitment to improving the game, with updates that address player feedback and introduce new content, which keeps the community engaged.

---

**Critiques:**
- **Learning Curve:** New players may find the mechanics and strategies somewhat complex at first. A more structured tutorial or guide could help ease newcomers into the game.
- **Balance Issues:** Occasionally, the balance between thieves and police can feel off, depending on the map and player experience. Some matches may lean heavily in favor of one side, which can be frustrating.

---

**Conclusion:**
""Perfect Heist 2"" successfully combines strategy, teamwork, and a lighthearted approach to heists. Its asymmetrical gameplay offers a fresh take on the genre, encouraging players to think creatively and work closely with teammates.

2701,Bopl Battle,"As fun as it is tilting - Bopl Battle is a really engaging, chaotic game where there's a lot of fun to be had, and a lot of chaos to sow and reap. A word of warning, though, not only is this best with real friends - if you're of uneven temperament, i would advise against this. It's very easy to get enraged by the game if you die a lot in a row, or run into a particually cheesy combo. That's just the nature of things like this, so bear that in mind if that would bother you. It's also a little much for what it is IMO, though if you've got friends it'll likely be worth a lot more to you.",7.0,Positive
2702,Bopl Battle,Fun crazy crackhead energy kinda game with the right group of people highly recommend lmao,4.0,Positive
2703,Bopl Battle,"Bopl Battle is an incredibly fun game for all sorts of people. It has loads of different options available for people with all sorts of different playstyles. You can play with up to 4 people and is a great option for those who like casual party games with friends that also can have a competitive element.

2713,Bopl Battle,"This is one of the most fun platform fighters I've ever played. It's depth doesn't come from complex movesets or a high technical skill ceiling, it comes from simple yet fully customizable movesets you can freely swap in and out and experiment with for synergies. Whether you're trying to build the jankiest, cheesiest moveset or running full random and seeing what you stumble into, you will never run out of things to do, especially with the right friend group.

2771,Bopl Battle,"This is a super fun game for a group of up to 4 friends! Def recommend to anyone who likes party games. You can play online and local. The one downside is that there are no bots. If you want to play solo you have to play online, and a lot of times its hard to get a full group because people leave or just troll. 

The huge amount of combinations you can do in this game makes it very chaotic and entertaining. You can really see everyones playstyle come out depending on the combos they choose. The way you kill other players can be very comedic as well. One example is the rock power-up, which my friend group gave the nickname ""Steve"". It's a power-up where you turn into and invincible rock that you can't control. You will often just fall into the water but sometimes you can just fly across the map and squish someone as steve and its so funny.

Battles feel fair. If you die. its mostly because you get outplayed or made a mistake yourself.

What can be better
Online settings could be impoved with game modes: Teamplay, random items mode, etc
The thing is.. You can do all these settings with friend. but strangers can not be communicated with. and sometimes that means you end up doing 3 vs 1 or You want random items, but they use a strong combo for all the matches.

2801,Bopl Battle,"As fun as it is tilting - Bopl Battle is a really engaging, chaotic game where there's a lot of fun to be had, and a lot of chaos to sow and reap. A word of warning, though, not only is this best with real friends - if you're of uneven temperament, i would advise against this. It's very easy to get enraged by the game if you die a lot in a row, or run into a particually cheesy combo. That's just the nature of things like this, so bear that in mind if that would bother you.

2813,Bopl Battle,"This is one of the most fun platform fighters I've ever played. It's depth doesn't come from complex movesets or a high technical skill ceiling, it comes from simple yet fully customizable movesets you can freely swap in and out and experiment with for synergies. Whether you're trying to build the jankiest, cheesiest moveset or running full random and seeing what you stumble into, you will never run out of things to do, especially with the right friend group.

But we did like 15 rounds witch allowed for some pretty funny stuff, like


-Impaling people

-ZA WORLDOOOO 

-Grenade :)

 -Beeg slime

-Chonker slime

2839,Bopl Battle,"Fun game. It has a surprisingly small skill gap and still has a lot of room for you to improve. Very fun to play with friends. However, it does have a severe lag issue when playing online. Sometimes the game will stall for a 1-2 second period of time if someone you are playing that has a high ping, and if anyone gets disconnected then the game will freeze up until you Alt F4 it.

2864,Bopl Battle,"I had seen this game on Tiktok quite a while back, and thought the premise was super cool. When I first bought the game, I had not realized that there was no online matchmaking yet. I recently booted the game up again after some time and online matchmaking had been implemented. I've since played for hours straight.",0.0,Positive

Should add a customizable random mode, which you eliminate the powers you don't want to use.",0.0,Positive
2866,Bopl Battle,"I think i've played this game enough to write a decent review. The one thing that kills me and many other players around the globe is client sided lag.

2871,Bopl Battle,"This is a super fun game for a group of up to 4 friends! Def recommend to anyone who likes party games. You can play online and local. The one downside is that there are no bots. If you want to play solo you have to play online, and a lot of times its hard to get a full group because people leave or just troll. 

The huge amount of combinations you can do in this game makes it very chaotic and entertaining. You can really see everyones playstyle come out depending on the combos they choose. The way you kill other players can be very comedic as well. One example is the rock power-up, which my friend group gave the nickname ""Steve"". It's a power-up where you turn into and invincible rock that you can't control. You will often just fall into the water but sometimes you can just fly across the map and squish someone as steve and its so funny.

Overall great game and the balancing feels pretty good with some exceptions.",0.0,Positive

Worth Money.
Funny concept.
Works smooth enough.
Funny combinations
I had more fun than I had with a lot of games for years. I laughed out loud several times.
Battles feel fair. If you die. its mostly because you get outplayed or made a mistake yourself.

What can be better
Online settings could be impoved with game modes: Teamplay, random items mode, etc
The thing is.. You can do all these settings with friend. but strangers can not be communicated with. and sometimes that means you end up doing 3 vs 1 or You want random items, but they use a strong combo for all the matches.
Music feels iconic, but gets annoying after 1 hour.

2901,Bopl Battle,"As fun as it is tilting - Bopl Battle is a really engaging, chaotic game where there's a lot of fun to be had, and a lot of chaos to sow and reap. A word of warning, though, not only is this best with real friends - if you're of uneven temperament, i would advise against this. It's very easy to get enraged by the game if you die a lot in a row, or run into a particually cheesy combo. That's just the nature of things like this, so bear that in mind if that would bother you. It's also a little much for what it is IMO, though if you've got friends it'll likely be worth a lot more to you.",7.0,Positive

It is exciting, fun, and always a good time with it's different customizable abilities, colours and combinations. It is very accessible with it's controller-friendly options and changeable hotkeys. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes having an incredibly fun time with friends or anyone else online.",3.0,Positive
2904,Bopl Battle,"Deceptively simple party game about smashing blobs on physics platforms with a good bit of depth and skill ceiling with its many abilities. Bopl Battle can and will be broken by outrageous ability combos and creative players. The achievements encourage experimenting, but are somewhat easy to farm with friends. An absolute blast with any amount of players, however the total lack of singleplayer content makes me weary of the $10 price tag.",1.0,Positive
2905,Bopl Battle,"It is a very fun game that should be played with at LEAST 3 people. Any less and it will be  boring. If you dont have friends to play it with it is not worth it.

2913,Bopl Battle,"This is one of the most fun platform fighters I've ever played. It's depth doesn't come from complex movesets or a high technical skill ceiling, it comes from simple yet fully customizable movesets you can freely swap in and out and experiment with for synergies. Whether you're trying to build the jankiest, cheesiest moveset or running full random and seeing what you stumble into, you will never run out of things to do, especially with the right friend group. I recommend checking out the dev's youtube channel since it provides fun insight into the balancing and design choices that go into this goofy game.",0.0,Positive

But we did like 15 rounds witch allowed for some pretty funny stuff, like


-Impaling people

-ZA WORLDOOOO 

-Grenade :)

 -Beeg slime

-Chonker slime

-giant black hole that erases everything you ever and ever will love making you question your mortality as a whole, making you wonder if there's more to life than losing.

2939,Bopl Battle,"Fun game. It has a surprisingly small skill gap and still has a lot of room for you to improve. Very fun to play with friends. However, it does have a severe lag issue when playing online. Sometimes the game will stall for a 1-2 second period of time if someone you are playing that has a high ping, and if anyone gets disconnected then the game will freeze up until you Alt F4 it. Until this issue is fixed I can't fully recommend anyone buy this game because if you don't have top-tier WiFi you will have a horrible experience.",0.0,Positive

2964,Bopl Battle,"I had seen this game on Tiktok quite a while back, and thought the premise was super cool. When I first bought the game, I had not realized that there was no online matchmaking yet. I recently booted the game up again after some time and online matchmaking had been implemented. I've since played for hours straight.",0.0,Positive

Should add a customizable random mode, which you eliminate the powers you don't want to use.",0.0,Positive
2966,Bopl Battle,"I think i've played this game enough to write a decent review. The one thing that kills me and many other players around the globe is client sided lag.

2970,Bopl Battle,"this game is a masterpiece
if you like the demo or even just see the game and think it looks interesting, i highly recommend you buy it it immediately, so fun with friends",0.0,Positive
2971,Bopl Battle,"This is a super fun game for a group of up to 4 friends! Def recommend to anyone who likes party games. You can play online and local. The one downside is that there are no bots. If you want to play solo you have to play online, and a lot of times its hard to get a full group because people leave or just troll. 

The huge amount of combinations you can do in this game makes it very chaotic and entertaining. You can really see everyones playstyle come out depending on the combos they choose. The way you kill other players can be very comedic as well. One example is the rock power-up, which my friend group gave the nickname ""Steve"". It's a power-up where you turn into and invincible rock that you can't control. You will often just fall into the water but sometimes you can just fly across the map and squish someone as steve and its so funny.

Overall great game and the balancing feels pretty good with some exceptions.",0.0,Positive

Funny combinations
I had more fun than I had with a lot of games for years. I laughed out loud several times.
Battles feel fair. If you die. its mostly because you get outplayed or made a mistake yourself.

What can be better
Online settings could be impoved with game modes: Teamplay, random items mode, etc
The thing is.. You can do all these settings with friend. but strangers can not be communicated with. and sometimes that means you end up doing 3 vs 1 or You want random items, but they use a strong combo for all the matches.
Music feels iconic, but gets annoying after 1 hour.

3600,Pit People®,"The cutscenes and fluff are all very amusing and funny. I've laughed several times in my time with the game. Unfortunately, the gameplay becomes very tedious after only a brief period. The fights feel like they take too long and the lack of control on who you're targeting makes it impossible to really focus an enemy down.

If the fights had been a more quick and brutal affair it might have been worth a recommendation. Unfortunately, they stick around so long it makes the humor start to fall flat.

I can't say that I hate the game. I'm just very disappointed.",5.0,Negative
3601,Pit People®,"The Game is fine and all and goes along with the lore to battle block theater a bit, but overall the game is not that fun. It is claimed to be a strategic game to last hours but I didn't find it that way at all. All you simply do is move your characters so they don't get hit, while also trying to attack the other enemies. I just don't see what some see in this game. I bought it hoping it would be as fun as there other games since it was the only one I haven't played, but it just wasn't for me. The game may not be bad or boring to all but to me it appeared to be so. I'm just warning those who aren't to sure about getting this game, if you like the fast action fighting or always on the go type play the other games have to offer, this is not it.",2.0,Negative
3602,Pit People®,"Even though it is a bit short (even for me, and i drop games after 15-20 hours typically) pit people is a fantastic little strategy game with some zany characters and genuinely funny moments. A great behemoth game even if it didn't sell very well.",2.0,Positive
3603,Pit People®,"Consider picking this up when it's on sale. It's a fun play with customization and a decent chunk of sidequests. The game can for sure be a hit or miss depending on whose playing it with its slow pacing and constantly similar and repeating battles. However, I think it has a lot of charms and a lot of uniqueness for the price at which it is presented. I do have to warn that the main focus of the game, the pit, is hardly functional due to the lack of players playing online at this point. Most thrilling experience in this game will most likely have to be solo or with a friend who has the game as well. There's also a bunch of mechanics with the capturing mechanic from customizable costumes, rare colored names, and epics for those who like to catch them all.

If the fights had been a more quick and brutal affair it might have been worth a recommendation. Unfortunately, they stick around so long it makes the humor start to fall flat.

3613,Pit People®,"The Game is fine and all and goes along with the lore to battle block theater a bit, but overall the game is not that fun. It is claimed to be a strategic game to last hours but I didn't find it that way at all. All you simply do is move your characters so they don't get hit, while also trying to attack the other enemies. I just don't see what some see in this game.

Unfortunately, the gameplay becomes very tedious after only a brief period. The fights feel like they take too long and the lack of control on who you're targeting makes it impossible to really focus an enemy down.

If the fights had been a more quick and brutal affair it might have been worth a recommendation. Unfortunately, they stick around so long it makes the humor start to fall flat.

3721,Pit People®,"The Game is fine and all and goes along with the lore to battle block theater a bit, but overall the game is not that fun. It is claimed to be a strategic game to last hours but I didn't find it that way at all. All you simply do is move your characters so they don't get hit, while also trying to attack the other enemies. I just don't see what some see in this game. I bought it hoping it would be as fun as there other games since it was the only one I haven't played, but it just wasn't for me.

3903,Duck Game,"Duck Game is the kind of silly game that you look at and expect to have a good time with your friends, some quick laughs, and a fair share of shenanigans. For all I know, Duck Game is my guaranteed go-to for fun. It never failed to make me invest hours and hours a day just to get through the same levels, with the same guns, same people, and not feel bored during the process.

 

Ever since I started playing the game, I always noticed just how much detail every little thing has, like how barrels spill fuel when you shoot at them, how you have to manually pull the pin of a grenade and also manually press another button to throw it, how every little gun has its recoil, how ducks swear when you throw objects at them; there are so many things you can do and see in this game. Frankly, it's unbelievable. I've spent a little more than 200 hours playing Duck Game, but I still think I'm yet to see ""new"" stuff that was always present during my gameplays and never noticed.

 

Duck game also has intriguingly deep gameplay that may have a lot of ""random"" details. Yet, all of those come together in action and become mechanics on their own. Let me exemplify:

 

There's a button with the sole purpose of becoming a ragdoll. You may think that this button is used only for jokes and shenanigans (like pretending to be dead), but when you manually become a ragdoll, the duck's body gets rearranged a few pixels above the ground; players quickly took notice of that fact and started using the ragdoll button to jump twice as higher than the usual.

 

Here's another intriguing gimmick: You can also float while airborne. Every time the duck switches sides while floating and holding a gun, the gun will almost instantly turn to the other side, pointing downwards, and then straightforward; the funny thing is that players took notice of how the gun doesn't just switch sides, it has a short time window that points down, remember when I said every weapon has its recoil? Players started using shotguns, AKs, pistols, and everything that has even the slightest bit of recoil to manually ""fly"" with a gun. This technique requires practice and a lot of skill to pull off constantly, aside from a lifesaving trick during competitive plays.

 

The game has always had these tricks, but they've never been presented in a way that informs new players about what they can or cannot do. You have to play it and learn it by yourself. The dev is well aware of the Mastercraft he built and tried to refine and expand those mechanics to the fullest. I can't talk about every hidden mechanic because it will render a LOT to talk about, but be sure that all of those details add up into a war, an incredibly goofy and technical mess of a war.

 

Duck Game was gifted with a suitable direction of art. The game's pixel art, soundtrack, backgrounds, and animations have all come with such love and detail that they became a set that could only fit Duck Game. Part of it comes from the adult swing vibe the game gives off, the other significant part comes from all the effort Landon Podbielski put into the game. It's visually and aurally distinct from every game of the genre, and that's part of why it feels so magical to experience it for the first time.

 

The game made me enjoy all the times I've been shot, kidnapped, bullied, hypnotized, alienated, sent flying off the map, and all of that because the game's focus is centered on providing the best multiplayer experience it can give. It never feels bad to lose, it never feels dull to win, and it always feels great to just have those fierce matches that may the best duck win.

 

Although it's mostly a multiplayer game, it also has an arcade singleplayer mode which tests the player's knowledge and ability about various aspects of the gameplay. The arcade mode also comes with challenges that come in the shape of medals, every level has a bronze, silver, gold, platinum[spoiler], and UR THE BEST[/spoiler] medal. The medals are quite difficult to get and I suggest everyone prove themselves in the test of fire just to get the very best medal (trust me, it is worth it).

 

Duck Game rocks, it nailed everything it wanted to offer and can provide even more than what it initially wanted to cover. If you were in doubt about buying the game, experiment giving it a try just to see how quickly you'll start spreading to your friends how great the game is.

Here's another intriguing gimmick: You can also float while airborne. Every time the duck switches sides while floating and holding a gun, the gun will almost instantly turn to the other side, pointing downwards, and then straightforward; the funny thing is that players took notice of how the gun doesn't just switch sides, it has a short time window that points down, remember when I said every weapon has its recoil? Players started using shotguns, AKs, pistols, and everything that has even the slightest bit of recoil to manually ""fly"" with a gun. This technique requires practice and a lot of skill to pull off constantly, aside from a lifesaving trick during competitive plays.

 

The game has always had these tricks, but they've never been presented in a way that informs new players about what they can or cannot do. You have to play it and learn it by yourself. The dev is well aware of the Mastercraft he built and tried to refine and expand those mechanics to the fullest. I can't talk about every hidden mechanic because it will render a LOT to talk about, but be sure that all of those details add up into a war, an incredibly goofy and technical mess of a war.

 

Duck Game was gifted with a suitable direction of art. The game's pixel art, soundtrack, backgrounds, and animations have all come with such love and detail that they became a set that could only fit Duck Game. Part of it comes from the adult swing vibe the game gives off, the other significant part comes from all the effort Landon Podbielski put into the game. It's visually and aurally distinct from every game of the genre, and that's part of why it feels so magical to experience it for the first time.

 

The game made me enjoy all the times I've been shot, kidnapped, bullied, hypnotized, alienated, sent flying off the map, and all of that because the game's focus is centered on providing the best multiplayer experience it can give. It never feels bad to lose, it never feels dull to win, and it always feels great to just have those fierce matches that may the best duck win.

 

Although it's mostly a multiplayer game, it also has an arcade singleplayer mode which tests the player's knowledge and ability about various aspects of the gameplay. The arcade mode also comes with challenges that come in the shape of medals, every level has a bronze, silver, gold, platinum[spoiler], and UR THE BEST[/spoiler] medal. The medals are quite difficult to get and I suggest everyone prove themselves in the test of fire just to get the very best medal (trust me, it is worth it).

 

Duck Game rocks, it nailed everything it wanted to offer and can provide even more than what it initially wanted to cover. If you were in doubt about buying the game, experiment giving it a try just to see how quickly you'll start spreading to your friends how great the game is.

3977,Duck Game,"Duck Game is the kind of silly game that you look at and expect to have a good time with your friends, some quick laughs, and a fair share of shenanigans. For all I know, Duck Game is my guaranteed go-to for fun. It never failed to make me invest hours and hours a day just to get through the same levels, with the same guns, same people, and not feel bored during the process.

 

Ever since I started playing the game, I always noticed just how much detail every little thing has, like how barrels spill fuel when you shoot at them, how you have to manually pull the pin of a grenade and also manually press another button to throw it, how every little gun has its recoil, how ducks swear when you throw objects at them; there are so many things you can do and see in this game. Frankly, it's unbelievable. I've spent a little more than 200 hours playing Duck Game, but I still think I'm yet to see ""new"" stuff that was always present during my gameplays and never noticed.

 

Duck game also has intriguingly deep gameplay that may have a lot of ""random"" details. Yet, all of those come together in action and become mechanics on their own. Let me exemplify:

I can't talk about every hidden mechanic because it will render a LOT to talk about, but be sure that all of those details add up into a war, an incredibly goofy and technical mess of a war.

 

Duck Game was gifted with a suitable direction of art. The game's pixel art, soundtrack, backgrounds, and animations have all come with such love and detail that they became a set that could only fit Duck Game. Part of it comes from the adult swing vibe the game gives off, the other significant part comes from all the effort Landon Podbielski put into the game. It's visually and aurally distinct from every game of the genre, and that's part of why it feels so magical to experience it for the first time.

 

The game made me enjoy all the times I've been shot, kidnapped, bullied, hypnotized, alienated, sent flying off the map, and all of that because the game's focus is centered on providing the best multiplayer experience it can give. It never feels bad to lose, it never feels dull to win, and it always feels great to just have those fierce matches that may the best duck win.

 

Although it's mostly a multiplayer game, it also has an arcade singleplayer mode which tests the player's knowledge and ability about various aspects of the gameplay. The arcade mode also comes with challenges that come in the shape of medals, every level has a bronze, silver, gold, platinum[spoiler], and UR THE BEST[/spoiler] medal. The medals are quite difficult to get and I suggest everyone prove themselves in the test of fire just to get the very best medal (trust me, it is worth it).

 

Duck Game rocks, it nailed everything it wanted to offer and can provide even more than what it initially wanted to cover. If you were in doubt about buying the game, experiment giving it a try just to see how quickly you'll start spreading to your friends how great the game is.

4125,Duck Game,"Duck Game is the kind of silly game that you look at and expect to have a good time with your friends, some quick laughs, and a fair share of shenanigans. For all I know, Duck Game is my guaranteed go-to for fun. It never failed to make me invest hours and hours a day just to get through the same levels, with the same guns, same people, and not feel bored during the process.

 

Ever since I started playing the game, I always noticed just how much detail every little thing has, like how barrels spill fuel when you shoot at them, how you have to manually pull the pin of a grenade and also manually press another button to throw it, how every little gun has its recoil, how ducks swear when you throw objects at them; there are so many things you can do and see in this game. Frankly, it's unbelievable. I've spent a little more than 200 hours playing Duck Game, but I still think I'm yet to see ""new"" stuff that was always present during my gameplays and never noticed.

 

Duck game also has intriguingly deep gameplay that may have a lot of ""random"" details. Yet, all of those come together in action and become mechanics on their own. Let me exemplify:

 

There's a button with the sole purpose of becoming a ragdoll. You may think that this button is used only for jokes and shenanigans (like pretending to be dead), but when you manually become a ragdoll, the duck's body gets rearranged a few pixels above the ground; players quickly took notice of that fact and started using the ragdoll button to jump twice as higher than the usual.

 

Here's another intriguing gimmick: You can also float while airborne. Every time the duck switches sides while floating and holding a gun, the gun will almost instantly turn to the other side, pointing downwards, and then straightforward; the funny thing is that players took notice of how the gun doesn't just switch sides, it has a short time window that points down, remember when I said every weapon has its recoil? Players started using shotguns, AKs, pistols, and everything that has even the slightest bit of recoil to manually ""fly"" with a gun. This technique requires practice and a lot of skill to pull off constantly, aside from a lifesaving trick during competitive plays.

 

The game has always had these tricks, but they've never been presented in a way that informs new players about what they can or cannot do. You have to play it and learn it by yourself. The dev is well aware of the Mastercraft he built and tried to refine and expand those mechanics to the fullest.

4206,ShellShock Live,"[h1]It’s TANKS![/h1]
 
[i]There will be a TL;DR at the end.[/i]
 
~
 
The classic [b]Tanks[/b] game from the arcade cabinets to the now defunct flash applications.
But in this incarnation, there are lots of twists!
Tons of ammunition, modifiers, and little aspects keep the matches fun and interesting.
Most astounding, and clever, is the addition of a simple-yet-effective leveling system.

You begin by lobbing very basic projectiles over hills at your opponents, but as you level up higher, you begin launching assaults of deadly disco balls, killer kittens, holy beams of radiance, bird droppings, and much more.

It’s wickedly creative, and between matches you can level up your tank to have more armor, higher critical chance, better equipment, or vastly increased traversal. Lots of customization options too.

The tempo is sinister and strong as well - you’ll hop into matches quickly, blow up your enemies (or get blown up yourself) and be going into the next match in record time with precious little downtime between.

It’s not much more over the original formula, and isn’t going to be captivating your heart and mind with novelties beyond the stars, but for what it is - it is strong.

It does have a shelf life. The core loop of lobbing things through the air to explode your enemy loses its finesse after a few hours - but it doesn’t push to overstay its welcome any.

Chatting with strangers while you embark on this silly, innocent, and simple game is a joy in and of its own.

Most astounding, and clever, is the addition of a simple-yet-effective leveling system.

You begin by lobbing very basic projectiles over hills at your opponents, but as you level up higher, you begin launching assaults of deadly disco balls, killer kittens, holy beams of radiance, bird droppings, and much more.

It’s wickedly creative, and between matches you can level up your tank to have more armor, higher critical chance, better equipment, or vastly increased traversal. Lots of customization options too.

The tempo is sinister and strong as well - you’ll hop into matches quickly, blow up your enemies (or get blown up yourself) and be going into the next match in record time with precious little downtime between.

It’s not much more over the original formula, and isn’t going to be captivating your heart and mind with novelties beyond the stars, but for what it is - it is strong.

It does have a shelf life. The core loop of lobbing things through the air to explode your enemy loses its finesse after a few hours - but it doesn’t push to overstay its welcome any.

4506,Worms W.M.D,"Worms is an artillery franchise that is based on a team vs team multiplayer, you can play against others online as well if you wish, this Worms W.M.D game offers not just your stand alone combat with grenade, bazookas even airstrikes on the other hand this worms game specifically introduces crafting as well as getting into vehicles also hiding into buildings as you don't get destroyed always a second option as you can blowtorch underground, I do however have a problem with the tank since you have to guess where the bombs are going to land since there's no land target or indicator anyway, the helicopter lets you fly from different positions, easy to escape the vulnerable positions where you are, The Mech is designed to be a op melee hitter when your near an opposition worm on a different team that's not your worm. The team that has worms remaining wins and for the losing team when all your team worms die then that's game over and a loss for you. Its a fun game combining if you've got the power, wits, skill also that vital accuracy, yes some weapons like the bazooka requires accuracy also to keep in mind while firing the bazooka is the wind direction so if the the wind is blowing on the left while firing chances are your going to struggle probably miss too as you need that power in order to get the worm on left who is not on your team, yeah its a difficult game if your playing online when wind is on, doesn't matter if your playing against a random A.I/CPU on easy or average difficulty, what I like to do is not put anything on like airstrikes just bazooka's, grenades for all that important long lasting matches/games because it would be boring if the match/game was over already, airstrikes for example would be over quick in a game of worms, I like to put on stuff that requires accuracy only, presents can be an accuracy weapon when thrown plus the longer the turns it has the more damage its going to do to a worm when its near the present, starts off 70 damage by time it be turn 5 it does 95 damage, In conclusion I recommend this game, its like artillery back in the 80's but worms is more becoming common that they are mascots to this fun artillery based game, where its just a big multiplayer hit as a series, theres about 10 worms games so far including Worms Armageddon, seems to be popular than Worms W.M.D as its still fun for my liking, buy it couldn't recommend it, just the same as the others, one last thing it will be the 30th anniversary of worms in 2025 so I think Team17 may make a new Worms game 2D like this one & Armageddon or a 3D game similar to Worms 3D or Ultimate Mayhem, yeah its a must buy Worms W.M.D, you could get it next time its on sale or you could buy it now, well I cant dictate what some people like to do with thier money but its thier decision if you are buying Worms W.M.D or not, down for recommendation for me that is all.",0.0,Positive

Its a fun game combining if you've got the power, wits, skill also that vital accuracy, yes some weapons like the bazooka requires accuracy also to keep in mind while firing the bazooka is the wind direction so if the the wind is blowing on the left while firing chances are your going to struggle probably miss too as you need that power in order to get the worm on left who is not on your team, yeah its a difficult game if your playing online when wind is on, doesn't matter if your playing against a random A.I/CPU on easy or average difficulty, what I like to do is not put anything on like airstrikes just bazooka's, grenades for all that important long lasting matches/games because it would be boring if the match/game was over already, airstrikes for example would be over quick in a game of worms, I like to put on stuff that requires accuracy only, presents can be an accuracy weapon when thrown plus the longer the turns it has the more damage its going to do to a worm when its near the present, starts off 70 damage by time it be turn 5 it does 95 damage, In conclusion I recommend this game, its like artillery back in the 80's but worms is more becoming common that they are mascots to this fun artillery based game, where its just a big multiplayer hit as a series, theres about 10 worms games so far including Worms Armageddon, seems to be popular than Worms W.M.D as its still fun for my liking, buy it couldn't recommend it, just the same as the others, one last thing it will be the 30th anniversary of worms in 2025 so I think Team17 may make a new Worms game 2D like this one & Armageddon or a 3D game similar to Worms 3D or Ultimate Mayhem, yeah its a must buy Worms W.M.D, you could get it next time its on sale or you could buy it now, well I cant dictate what some people like to do with thier money but its thier decision if you are buying Worms W.M.D or not, down for recommendation for me that is all.",0.0,Positive

4747,Worms W.M.D,"Overall if you liked any of the classic worms games back in the day you will probably like this slightly more modern version.

Pros: Improved graphics, more mayhem with vehicles, more items, and still hilariously fun!
Cons: Crafting is kind of annoying micro-management addition that is required often ...

Note: if you are not running Windows you will need to use Proton compatibility mode as the native Qt build will segfault due to ABI mismatches even after fixing all the steam runtime library issues to load the libraries and launch!",0.0,Positive

5104,Cat Goes Fishing,despite it looking bad and boring in the images it is really fun and relaxing its good in my opinion,0.0,Positive
5105,Cat Goes Fishing,"I really like this game, it's a style I've never seen before but it just works for me. It's worth the price and would recommend everyone who likes casual fishing in casual mode or actual strategy in realism mode. One MAJOR problem though, I have (had) 5 saves, and when I go out of the game, sometimes, and I mean like every 4 or so times I quit the game. The saves are just no longer there, until I click new game, the saved data that the save used to have just appears, when this problem occurs, only my primary save in save slot one shows up correctly. It's the only one that loads in correctly and I dont know how to fix it. I was part way through realism mode, and plan to get all the achievements, and I just bought the 1.5million dollar boat. Then I hit copy save where that realism save was and it was just gone. I will remember this happened so that this doesn't happen again, but I hope that the devs fix this issue so no one else accidentally deletes their data. Also I think you should add a possible refresh feature instead, or at least a confirmation to copy/delete saves. I'm gonna get back to fishing in a new realism mode.",0.0,Positive

It seems that the moderation team is failing to maintain a fair and equitable gaming environment. My friend’s ban appears to be arbitrary, and attempts to appeal the decision have gone ignored. This lack of accountability from the admins is concerning, especially when players are unfairly punished without cause.

Furthermore, the moderation practices seem biased, as individuals close to the admin team can engage in toxic behavior without facing the consequences. This not only disrupts the gameplay experience but also creates a hostile environment for players who simply want to enjoy social interactions.

Game Review: Tower Unite

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Tower Unite is a vibrant multiplayer experience that masterfully blends social interaction, gaming, and creative expression. Developed by PixelTail Games, it serves as a spiritual successor to the beloved Garry's Mod mini-games, taking players to an expansive, persistent world filled with various activities.

Gameplay & Features: At its core, Tower Unite is a community hub where players can explore the titular Tower—a virtual space packed with different floors, each offering unique experiences. From arcade-style mini-games to a customizable apartment, the game is rich with options. You can play classic favorites like “Virus” and “Minigolf,” or try your hand at new games like “Ball Race.” The mini-games are well-designed and provide a nice mix of competition and casual fun.

One of the standout features is the ability to customize your own space. Players can decorate their apartments with a variety of items earned through gameplay, creating a unique personal haven to showcase to friends. This adds a layer of investment and creativity, making each player’s experience feel personal.

Graphics & Sound: The graphics in Tower Unite are colorful and cartoonish, fitting perfectly with the lighthearted tone of the game. The environments are diverse and charming, from the bustling Tower itself to the serene landscapes found in mini-golf courses. Sound design complements the visuals well, with catchy tunes and playful sound effects that enhance the overall atmosphere.

Community & Social Interaction: The heart of Tower Unite lies in its community. The game encourages socialization, whether it’s teaming up for mini-golf, chatting in the plaza, or just hanging out in someone’s apartment. Events and updates keep the community engaged, with frequent additions to mini-games and seasonal content. The player base is generally friendly, making it easy for newcomers to jump in and feel welcomed.

Room for Improvement: While Tower Unite shines in many areas, it’s not without its minor flaws. Some mini-games can feel a bit unbalanced, and there are occasional technical hiccups, particularly with server stability during peak times. However, these issues are often outweighed by the overall enjoyment of the game.

Conclusion: Overall, Tower Unite is a delightful blend of gaming and social interaction that captures the essence of fun in a virtual playground. With its engaging mini-games, customizable spaces, and strong community focus, it offers something for everyone. Whether you’re a casual gamer or a social butterfly, Tower Unite is an absolute must-play. Grab your friends, dive into the Tower, and let the good times roll!",1.0,Positive

5712,Tower Unite,"Buggy with bad backend servers. Its fun if you dont mind not gaining or being able to redeem tickets from the arcade, or getting coins scammed because ""the servers are experiencing issues"" after you start a game at the casino.

5720,Tower Unite,"This game is a bit but not that old, and if you ever played Gmod tower just visit this game by the devs its just an amazing step up in the direction they wanted, zero microtransactions, and just tons of fun with friends, I already gifted this game to 4 friends and will keep on doing whenever I get the chance, game says its still in early access but they keep on adding more stuff even if nowadays might feel like its slow, lots and lots of tweaks keeps on happening over time, if you think this game is dead you are dead wrong because it still has a very nice community in the servers just having fun and in general being social, dare I say this is the kind of game I was expecting with things like vrchat even, just a really nice experience ♥",0.0,Positive
5721,Tower Unite,"This game is many games packed into one, while also being a cool virtual world of a theme park. The bowling alley is straight out of any other real bowling alley you might walk into (and yes you can just walk up to an open lane and start playing!) I've watched the arcade grow over time with new games being added into it (and you get tickets, that you can shove into a ticket machine that eats them and it's so satisfying!) Like maybe this game will never have a 1.0 release, because they're still doing weekly dev logs years later, but this is one game where I don't think it's a bad thing. So many new games and features are consistently being added, or worked on behind the scenes all these years, that I've more than gotten my money's worth out of the game. (Also no microtransactions!!

Game Review: Tower Unite

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Tower Unite is a vibrant multiplayer experience that masterfully blends social interaction, gaming, and creative expression. Developed by PixelTail Games, it serves as a spiritual successor to the beloved Garry's Mod mini-games, taking players to an expansive, persistent world filled with various activities.

Gameplay & Features: At its core, Tower Unite is a community hub where players can explore the titular Tower—a virtual space packed with different floors, each offering unique experiences. From arcade-style mini-games to a customizable apartment, the game is rich with options. You can play classic favorites like “Virus” and “Minigolf,” or try your hand at new games like “Ball Race.” The mini-games are well-designed and provide a nice mix of competition and casual fun.

One of the standout features is the ability to customize your own space. Players can decorate their apartments with a variety of items earned through gameplay, creating a unique personal haven to showcase to friends. This adds a layer of investment and creativity, making each player’s experience feel personal.

Graphics & Sound: The graphics in Tower Unite are colorful and cartoonish, fitting perfectly with the lighthearted tone of the game. The environments are diverse and charming, from the bustling Tower itself to the serene landscapes found in mini-golf courses. Sound design complements the visuals well, with catchy tunes and playful sound effects that enhance the overall atmosphere.

Community & Social Interaction: The heart of Tower Unite lies in its community. The game encourages socialization, whether it’s teaming up for mini-golf, chatting in the plaza, or just hanging out in someone’s apartment. Events and updates keep the community engaged, with frequent additions to mini-games and seasonal content. The player base is generally friendly, making it easy for newcomers to jump in and feel welcomed.

Room for Improvement: While Tower Unite shines in many areas, it’s not without its minor flaws. Some mini-games can feel a bit unbalanced, and there are occasional technical hiccups, particularly with server stability during peak times. However, these issues are often outweighed by the overall enjoyment of the game.

Conclusion: Overall, Tower Unite is a delightful blend of gaming and social interaction that captures the essence of fun in a virtual playground. With its engaging mini-games, customizable spaces, and strong community focus, it offers something for everyone. Whether you’re a casual gamer or a social butterfly, Tower Unite is an absolute must-play. Grab your friends, dive into the Tower, and let the good times roll!",1.0,Positive

Honestly, after so much time, I’m starting to question what's real; was I supposed to go to work today or did I just spend the entire afternoon betting virtual money on digital horse races? Either way, the character customization is impressive, allowing you to craft the perfect version of yourself before abandoning all responsibilities to live in a virtual world where paying rent is optional and winning jackpots is your new life goal. Oh, and the mini-games? You’ll spend more time mastering them than your real-world job, because why have a life when you can simulate a better one?

5801,Tower Unite,"Tower Unite claims to be a social gaming platform, but my experience has been anything but positive. I was banned without any justification or opportunity for appeal, highlighting a severe issue with the game’s corrupt moderation. I’ve spent money to play this game, and now I find myself unable to communicate with friends due to the whims of admins who clearly prioritize personal connections over fairness.

The admins protect their friends at the expense of honest players. One specific player, who is known for bullying, is connected to the moderation team and has manipulated the situation to their advantage. After a spy took a screenshot of my avatar—which they misidentified as being associated with another account—I was unfairly banned. This blatant abuse of power shows how toxic the environment is.

If you’re thinking about playing Tower Unite, don’t waste your time or money. The game is plagued by drama and the very people who should be ensuring a fair experience are the ones creating chaos. The admins seem to ignore the wrongdoings of certain players, like Cass and Caleb, while punishing others who are simply trying to enjoy the game.

In short, Tower Unite is a garbage game rife with corruption and unfair treatment. Save yourself the hassle and find a better gaming experience elsewhere.

There is already a big group of unfair bans that can be easily used to sue a company that lets you waste your money I will report this if they don't unban me. They gave me no evidence or reason let that sink it and don't bother to look into my account to see that I am a normal person. People have been banned for just one word and the ones on this game for a longer time harass and get away with it because they suck off the admins. Dying game it was good before from what I hear seems like they just care about getting their ego stroked at this point.

It seems that the moderation team is failing to maintain a fair and equitable gaming environment. My friend’s ban appears to be arbitrary, and attempts to appeal the decision have gone ignored. This lack of accountability from the admins is concerning, especially when players are unfairly punished without cause.

Furthermore, the moderation practices seem biased, as individuals close to the admin team can engage in toxic behavior without facing the consequences. This not only disrupts the gameplay experience but also creates a hostile environment for players who simply want to enjoy social interactions.

I urge you to look into these practices and take action to ensure fair treatment for all players. The current situation is detrimental to the community and undermines the integrity of Tower Unite.

You can play classic favorites like “Virus” and “Minigolf,” or try your hand at new games like “Ball Race.” The mini-games are well-designed and provide a nice mix of competition and casual fun.

One of the standout features is the ability to customize your own space. Players can decorate their apartments with a variety of items earned through gameplay, creating a unique personal haven to showcase to friends. This adds a layer of investment and creativity, making each player’s experience feel personal.

Graphics & Sound: The graphics in Tower Unite are colorful and cartoonish, fitting perfectly with the lighthearted tone of the game. The environments are diverse and charming, from the bustling Tower itself to the serene landscapes found in mini-golf courses. Sound design complements the visuals well, with catchy tunes and playful sound effects that enhance the overall atmosphere.

Community & Social Interaction: The heart of Tower Unite lies in its community. The game encourages socialization, whether it’s teaming up for mini-golf, chatting in the plaza, or just hanging out in someone’s apartment. Events and updates keep the community engaged, with frequent additions to mini-games and seasonal content. The player base is generally friendly, making it easy for newcomers to jump in and feel welcomed.

Room for Improvement: While Tower Unite shines in many areas, it’s not without its minor flaws. Some mini-games can feel a bit unbalanced, and there are occasional technical hiccups, particularly with server stability during peak times. However, these issues are often outweighed by the overall enjoyment of the game.

Conclusion: Overall, Tower Unite is a delightful blend of gaming and social interaction that captures the essence of fun in a virtual playground. With its engaging mini-games, customizable spaces, and strong community focus, it offers something for everyone. Whether you’re a casual gamer or a social butterfly, Tower Unite is an absolute must-play. Grab your friends, dive into the Tower, and let the good times roll!",1.0,Positive

Either way, the character customization is impressive, allowing you to craft the perfect version of yourself before abandoning all responsibilities to live in a virtual world where paying rent is optional and winning jackpots is your new life goal. Oh, and the mini-games? You’ll spend more time mastering them than your real-world job, because why have a life when you can simulate a better one?

5899,Tower Unite,"Tower Unite claims to be a social gaming platform, but my experience has been anything but positive. I was banned without any justification or opportunity for appeal, highlighting a severe issue with the game’s corrupt moderation. I’ve spent money to play this game, and now I find myself unable to communicate with friends due to the whims of admins who clearly prioritize personal connections over fairness.

The admins protect their friends at the expense of honest players. One specific player, who is known for bullying, is connected to the moderation team and has manipulated the situation to their advantage. After a spy took a screenshot of my avatar—which they misidentified as being associated with another account—I was unfairly banned. This blatant abuse of power shows how toxic the environment is.

If you’re thinking about playing Tower Unite, don’t waste your time or money. The game is plagued by drama and the very people who should be ensuring a fair experience are the ones creating chaos. The admins seem to ignore the wrongdoings of certain players, like Cass and Caleb, while punishing others who are simply trying to enjoy the game.

In short, Tower Unite is a garbage game rife with corruption and unfair treatment. Save yourself the hassle and find a better gaming experience elsewhere.

There is already a big group of unfair bans that can be easily used to sue a company that lets you waste your money I will report this if they don't unban me. They gave me no evidence or reason let that sink it and don't bother to look into my account to see that I am a normal person. People have been banned for just one word and the ones on this game for a longer time harass and get away with it because they suck off the admins. Dying game it was good before from what I hear seems like they just care about getting their ego stroked at this point.

It seems that the moderation team is failing to maintain a fair and equitable gaming environment. My friend’s ban appears to be arbitrary, and attempts to appeal the decision have gone ignored. This lack of accountability from the admins is concerning, especially when players are unfairly punished without cause.

Furthermore, the moderation practices seem biased, as individuals close to the admin team can engage in toxic behavior without facing the consequences. This not only disrupts the gameplay experience but also creates a hostile environment for players who simply want to enjoy social interactions.

I urge you to look into these practices and take action to ensure fair treatment for all players. The current situation is detrimental to the community and undermines the integrity of Tower Unite.

5956,Tower Unite,"It's just really not for me. The games are kinda boring and tedious, the whole place feels kinda jank.

I got it to play with a friend but I've barely played it at all and not in almost a year.",3.0,Negative
5957,Tower Unite,"Buggy with bad backend servers. Its fun if you dont mind not gaining or being able to redeem tickets from the arcade, or getting coins scammed because ""the servers are experiencing issues"" after you start a game at the casino.

There is lots to do in the game, but it really takes the fun out of it when you cant accumulate tickets for prizes or decorations, or have to constantly deal with laggy servers. This game needs some work before I can give it a positive review.",5.0,Negative
5958,Tower Unite,"there aren't a lot of games like this left! Whirled, gmod Tower, LINEPlay and the heyday of sites like GaiaOnline and TinierMe -- all of it is gone, but the spirit of those times and places drifts here. something just as special lives right here, and if you feel like you've missed out... here you are!",0.0,Positive

5964,Tower Unite,"Its a bit of good casual fun, it does still get regular updates and new things, however this is one of those games that's been in Early Access for over 8 years and it feels like it was released too soon as in, its extremely easy to break the game just by simply playing it, from getting permanently stuck in interactables like machines or doors, menu elements breaking/not responding to changes and bugging out the game entirely by doing something too fast..

I'd still say I got my moneys worth though.",0.0,Positive
5965,Tower Unite,"This game is a bit but not that old, and if you ever played Gmod tower just visit this game by the devs its just an amazing step up in the direction they wanted, zero microtransactions, and just tons of fun with friends, I already gifted this game to 4 friends and will keep on doing whenever I get the chance, game says its still in early access but they keep on adding more stuff even if nowadays might feel like its slow, lots and lots of tweaks keeps on happening over time, if you think this game is dead you are dead wrong because it still has a very nice community in the servers just having fun and in general being social, dare I say this is the kind of game I was expecting with things like vrchat even, just a really nice experience ♥",0.0,Positive
5966,Tower Unite,"This game is many games packed into one, while also being a cool virtual world of a theme park. The bowling alley is straight out of any other real bowling alley you might walk into (and yes you can just walk up to an open lane and start playing!) I've watched the arcade grow over time with new games being added into it (and you get tickets, that you can shove into a ticket machine that eats them and it's so satisfying!) Like maybe this game will never have a 1.0 release, because they're still doing weekly dev logs years later, but this is one game where I don't think it's a bad thing. So many new games and features are consistently being added, or worked on behind the scenes all these years, that I've more than gotten my money's worth out of the game. (Also no microtransactions!! Huge plus for a game they're continuing to add free content to.)",0.0,Positive

5994,Tower Unite,"Welcome to the ultimate life simulator, where you can waste a thousand hours at the in-game casino without feeling guilty... or maybe you should? Honestly, after so much time, I’m starting to question what's real; was I supposed to go to work today or did I just spend the entire afternoon betting virtual money on digital horse races? Either way, the character customization is impressive, allowing you to craft the perfect version of yourself before abandoning all responsibilities to live in a virtual world where paying rent is optional and winning jackpots is your new life goal. Oh, and the mini-games? You’ll spend more time mastering them than your real-world job, because why have a life when you can simulate a better one?

5995,Tower Unite,"zero micro transactions, a dedicated dev team, and a passionate and creative user base. What more could you ask for? Endless possibilities and constant content updates to keep things fresh have me returning more often than I do to many AAA games. TU proves you dont need to prioritize monetization and incentives to keep people playing your game, and more game companies should be aspiring to achieve what these people do for a singular purchase of $20",3.0,Positive
5996,Tower Unite,"Perfect game to play late at night. People within the world are usually all friendly. Lots of mini games/gambling to do, can build yourself a dream house or just walk around to chill. Constantly updated with new content as well. 4 out of 5.",2.0,Positive
5997,Tower Unite,"Tower Unite claims to be a social gaming platform, but my experience has been anything but positive. I was banned without any justification or opportunity for appeal, highlighting a severe issue with the game’s corrupt moderation. I’ve spent money to play this game, and now I find myself unable to communicate with friends due to the whims of admins who clearly prioritize personal connections over fairness.

The admins protect their friends at the expense of honest players. One specific player, who is known for bullying, is connected to the moderation team and has manipulated the situation to their advantage. After a spy took a screenshot of my avatar—which they misidentified as being associated with another account—I was unfairly banned. This blatant abuse of power shows how toxic the environment is.

If you’re thinking about playing Tower Unite, don’t waste your time or money. The game is plagued by drama and the very people who should be ensuring a fair experience are the ones creating chaos. The admins seem to ignore the wrongdoings of certain players, like Cass and Caleb, while punishing others who are simply trying to enjoy the game.

In short, Tower Unite is a garbage game rife with corruption and unfair treatment. Save yourself the hassle and find a better gaming experience elsewhere.

There is already a big group of unfair bans that can be easily used to sue a company that lets you waste your money I will report this if they don't unban me. They gave me no evidence or reason let that sink it and don't bother to look into my account to see that I am a normal person. People have been banned for just one word and the ones on this game for a longer time harass and get away with it because they suck off the admins. Dying game it was good before from what I hear seems like they just care about getting their ego stroked at this point.

It seems that the moderation team is failing to maintain a fair and equitable gaming environment. My friend’s ban appears to be arbitrary, and attempts to appeal the decision have gone ignored. This lack of accountability from the admins is concerning, especially when players are unfairly punished without cause.

Furthermore, the moderation practices seem biased, as individuals close to the admin team can engage in toxic behavior without facing the consequences. This not only disrupts the gameplay experience but also creates a hostile environment for players who simply want to enjoy social interactions.

I urge you to look into these practices and take action to ensure fair treatment for all players. The current situation is detrimental to the community and undermines the integrity of Tower Unite.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.",18.0,Negative

6901,Human Fall Flat,"Devs stick with the game and give it updates, plus community maps. It's a fun little game to get with your friends, especially when it's on sale. Levels have enough different obstacles/mechanics to keep it from being boring.",8.0,Positive
6902,Human Fall Flat,"my friends and i started to die of laughter after a while into our play session and it was the best time we've had that night. though, there's some camera issues that can cause serious motion sickness, but this game is definitely worth grabbing, especially with friends as long as you all aren't making each other very angry.",3.0,Positive
6903,Human Fall Flat,"I would recommend it. I play with 3 other friends and have a blast playing it. It’s fun dragging them over the edge of the map randomly lol. There is no death technically as you instantly respawn. I would say the hardest part about the game are the controls which have quite large learning curve imo. Takes some time getting used to. The maps themselves scale fairly well from easy to hard. Depending on how good you and your friends are at solving puzzles you may finish the game in 10-15 hours. I remember one level I was doing with my friends on playstation took 3 hours to complete the coast then and the second time we did it in 30min.

Only downside I would say is some levels were clearly only designed for one player so having multiple makes it too easy. For example one puzzle may involve getting a box onto a switch to open the door to the next part. In multiplayer it’s as simple as just one player standing on the switch while the other goes through the door. Yes you can decide to do the levels properly. Although sometimes it’s quite fun looking for ways to solve the puzzles as quickly as possible by seeing what parts we can skip entirely.",2.0,Positive
6904,Human Fall Flat,"Multiplayer mode adds another layer of enjoyment, allowing friends to collaborate or hilariously hinder each other.

Human: Fall Flat is a unique experience in which you can fumble your way through levels with up to 7 friends (although I prefer to go solo). I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates fun, well-crafted 3d games. There never has been, nor will there ever be a game that can match HFF as far as potential for endless possibilities and fun.

6912,Human Fall Flat,"played this on Macbook pro m3. this is a pretty fun game but the camera movement gives me motion sickness and it stops being enjoyable because of that. the camera should be more stable. if you have motion sickness this game isnt for you. i don't have this problem with like 95% of games so i found it strange feeling a little nauseous. 
i like the colors and the simple design of this game. the character outfits are cute n funny. free customization. good, detailed puzzles. 
sometimes it is hard to grab objects or grab onto something. a bit hard to get to destinations. the characters are too wobbly and its hard to seriously finish a task or just not be useless. that is really frustrating to me!!! 
they should also add a graphics quality tab so you could change it if you want to. some people may want to lower the quality for multiple reasons.  
lastly i would like to thank the developers for making this game MacOS compatible because apple has recently started performing better with games and people on these devices also want to play something good. 
if the creators notice all of these small problems and try to better the game physics and UI then i could fully recommend this game, if not them id rather say its a 50/50 game. Not for everyone.",0.0,Positive

Also the vases on the scales keep slightly vibrating which makes them fall of even if you stand them up next to each other as center as possible.

Also if you restart the map trough ""ESC"" and ""Restart level"" the two yellow batteries stay in place where you need to place them, but the bridge to the other side of the sewer won't open.

[b] You play as the clumsy yet lovable Bob, a walking, talking (well, more like grunting) catastrophe waiting to happen. Coincidentally, I played this with my buddy who also happens to be nicknamed Bob, making our wacky adventures even more entertaining. Navigating the puzzles in this game is like trying to walk on ice while wearing roller skates—challenging and bound to end in disaster, but always entertaining. [/b]

[i] The real gem of this ragdoll-physics masterpiece is playing with a friend. I can guarantee you'll be crying tears of laughter as you both flail around like drunken octopuses attempting to solve puzzles. it's a short but memorable experience perfect for anyone seeking lighthearted, chaotic fun.

6948,Human Fall Flat,"The game can be fun but it is also very painful to play. The need to click and hold for extended periods of times and repeatedly is not for the faint of heart, or more to the point those with issue with their fingers and joints. Though i do admit it depends on the mouse in question as to how bad it might be.
Doing that while also having move your mouse around and hold both left and right mouse buttons at the same time is not at all enjoyable, and only the desire to complete all the achievements and the otherwise okay game play has kept me playing and not completely annoyed that i bought the game only to suffer.
If there was a demo i'd said play that first before deciding if the above and the annoying physics and mechanics that don't want to cooperate and be consistent all the time are for you or not.",1.0,Negative

6959,Human Fall Flat,"Picture this: your character, Bob, is the living embodiment of clumsiness. He waddles, stumbles, and flails around like a toddler who just discovered caffeine. The physics are so wonky that if you tried to describe them to someone, they'd think you were having a stroke. Bob’s limbs seem to operate independently of each other, like he’s constantly trying to get an extra paycheck from the “Limbs for Sale” store.

The puzzles in Human: Fall Flat are a delightful mix of genius and sheer nonsense. You’ll find yourself swinging from a rope like an overgrown monkey, trying to use a seesaw as a catapult, or balancing on a giant log with the grace of a baby giraffe on roller skates. The game’s design encourages creative solutions, which mostly translates to “let’s see how many ways I can break this without actually solving the puzzle.”

Honestly, it is the perfect game for anyone who enjoys laughing at their own incompetence or watching friends bumble around like they’re trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube while blindfolded. If you ever need a reminder of how ridiculously entertaining failure can be, this game is your hilarious, wobbling, flailing answer.",4.0,Positive

7002,Human Fall Flat,"my friends and i started to die of laughter after a while into our play session and it was the best time we've had that night. though, there's some camera issues that can cause serious motion sickness, but this game is definitely worth grabbing, especially with friends as long as you all aren't making each other very angry.",3.0,Positive
7003,Human Fall Flat,"I would recommend it. I play with 3 other friends and have a blast playing it. It’s fun dragging them over the edge of the map randomly lol. There is no death technically as you instantly respawn. I would say the hardest part about the game are the controls which have quite large learning curve imo. Takes some time getting used to. The maps themselves scale fairly well from easy to hard. Depending on how good you and your friends are at solving puzzles you may finish the game in 10-15 hours. I remember one level I was doing with my friends on playstation took 3 hours to complete the coast then and the second time we did it in 30min.

Only downside I would say is some levels were clearly only designed for one player so having multiple makes it too easy. For example one puzzle may involve getting a box onto a switch to open the door to the next part. In multiplayer it’s as simple as just one player standing on the switch while the other goes through the door. Yes you can decide to do the levels properly. Although sometimes it’s quite fun looking for ways to solve the puzzles as quickly as possible by seeing what parts we can skip entirely.",2.0,Positive
7004,Human Fall Flat,"Multiplayer mode adds another layer of enjoyment, allowing friends to collaborate or hilariously hinder each other.

7008,Human Fall Flat,"This game looks like a joke, and it is one—in the best way.
Human: Fall Flat is a unique experience in which you can fumble your way through levels with up to 7 friends (although I prefer to go solo). I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates fun, well-crafted 3d games. There never has been, nor will there ever be a game that can match HFF as far as potential for endless possibilities and fun. However, be warned—when you start playing, you will not want to stop.",0.0,Positive

7012,Human Fall Flat,"played this on Macbook pro m3. this is a pretty fun game but the camera movement gives me motion sickness and it stops being enjoyable because of that. the camera should be more stable. if you have motion sickness this game isnt for you. i don't have this problem with like 95% of games so i found it strange feeling a little nauseous. 
i like the colors and the simple design of this game. the character outfits are cute n funny. free customization. good, detailed puzzles. 
sometimes it is hard to grab objects or grab onto something. a bit hard to get to destinations. the characters are too wobbly and its hard to seriously finish a task or just not be useless. that is really frustrating to me!!! 
they should also add a graphics quality tab so you could change it if you want to. some people may want to lower the quality for multiple reasons.  
lastly i would like to thank the developers for making this game MacOS compatible because apple has recently started performing better with games and people on these devices also want to play something good. 
if the creators notice all of these small problems and try to better the game physics and UI then i could fully recommend this game, if not them id rather say its a 50/50 game. Not for everyone.",0.0,Positive

Also the vases on the scales keep slightly vibrating which makes them fall of even if you stand them up next to each other as center as possible.

Also if you restart the map trough ""ESC"" and ""Restart level"" the two yellow batteries stay in place where you need to place them, but the bridge to the other side of the sewer won't open.

7045,Human Fall Flat,"[h1] Human: Fall Flat is a hilarious physics-based puzzle game. 옷옷[/h1]

[b] You play as the clumsy yet lovable Bob, a walking, talking (well, more like grunting) catastrophe waiting to happen. Coincidentally, I played this with my buddy who also happens to be nicknamed Bob, making our wacky adventures even more entertaining. Navigating the puzzles in this game is like trying to walk on ice while wearing roller skates—challenging and bound to end in disaster, but always entertaining. [/b]

[i] The real gem of this ragdoll-physics masterpiece is playing with a friend.

7048,Human Fall Flat,"The game can be fun but it is also very painful to play. The need to click and hold for extended periods of times and repeatedly is not for the faint of heart, or more to the point those with issue with their fingers and joints. Though i do admit it depends on the mouse in question as to how bad it might be.
Doing that while also having move your mouse around and hold both left and right mouse buttons at the same time is not at all enjoyable, and only the desire to complete all the achievements and the otherwise okay game play has kept me playing and not completely annoyed that i bought the game only to suffer.
If there was a demo i'd said play that first before deciding if the above and the annoying physics and mechanics that don't want to cooperate and be consistent all the time are for you or not.",1.0,Negative

7059,Human Fall Flat,"Picture this: your character, Bob, is the living embodiment of clumsiness. He waddles, stumbles, and flails around like a toddler who just discovered caffeine. The physics are so wonky that if you tried to describe them to someone, they'd think you were having a stroke. Bob’s limbs seem to operate independently of each other, like he’s constantly trying to get an extra paycheck from the “Limbs for Sale” store.

The puzzles in Human: Fall Flat are a delightful mix of genius and sheer nonsense. You’ll find yourself swinging from a rope like an overgrown monkey, trying to use a seesaw as a catapult, or balancing on a giant log with the grace of a baby giraffe on roller skates. The game’s design encourages creative solutions, which mostly translates to “let’s see how many ways I can break this without actually solving the puzzle.”

Honestly, it is the perfect game for anyone who enjoys laughing at their own incompetence or watching friends bumble around like they’re trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube while blindfolded. If you ever need a reminder of how ridiculously entertaining failure can be, this game is your hilarious, wobbling, flailing answer.",4.0,Positive

Also the vases on the scales keep slightly vibrating which makes them fall of even if you stand them up next to each other as center as possible.

Also if you restart the map trough ""ESC"" and ""Restart level"" the two yellow batteries stay in place where you need to place them, but the bridge to the other side of the sewer won't open.

7145,Human Fall Flat,"[h1] Human: Fall Flat is a hilarious physics-based puzzle game. 옷옷[/h1]

[b] You play as the clumsy yet lovable Bob, a walking, talking (well, more like grunting) catastrophe waiting to happen. Coincidentally, I played this with my buddy who also happens to be nicknamed Bob, making our wacky adventures even more entertaining. Navigating the puzzles in this game is like trying to walk on ice while wearing roller skates—challenging and bound to end in disaster, but always entertaining. [/b]

[i] The real gem of this ragdoll-physics masterpiece is playing with a friend. I can guarantee you'll be crying tears of laughter as you both flail around like drunken octopuses attempting to solve puzzles. it's a short but memorable experience perfect for anyone seeking lighthearted, chaotic fun.

7148,Human Fall Flat,"The game can be fun but it is also very painful to play. The need to click and hold for extended periods of times and repeatedly is not for the faint of heart, or more to the point those with issue with their fingers and joints. Though i do admit it depends on the mouse in question as to how bad it might be.
Doing that while also having move your mouse around and hold both left and right mouse buttons at the same time is not at all enjoyable, and only the desire to complete all the achievements and the otherwise okay game play has kept me playing and not completely annoyed that i bought the game only to suffer.
If there was a demo i'd said play that first before deciding if the above and the annoying physics and mechanics that don't want to cooperate and be consistent all the time are for you or not.",1.0,Negative

7159,Human Fall Flat,"Picture this: your character, Bob, is the living embodiment of clumsiness. He waddles, stumbles, and flails around like a toddler who just discovered caffeine. The physics are so wonky that if you tried to describe them to someone, they'd think you were having a stroke. Bob’s limbs seem to operate independently of each other, like he’s constantly trying to get an extra paycheck from the “Limbs for Sale” store.

The puzzles in Human: Fall Flat are a delightful mix of genius and sheer nonsense. You’ll find yourself swinging from a rope like an overgrown monkey, trying to use a seesaw as a catapult, or balancing on a giant log with the grace of a baby giraffe on roller skates. The game’s design encourages creative solutions, which mostly translates to “let’s see how many ways I can break this without actually solving the puzzle.”

Honestly, it is the perfect game for anyone who enjoys laughing at their own incompetence or watching friends bumble around like they’re trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube while blindfolded. If you ever need a reminder of how ridiculously entertaining failure can be, this game is your hilarious, wobbling, flailing answer.",4.0,Positive

The game is unplayable with the keybinds forced on u and u cant remap anything.
Its a console game where they didnt bother to at least mapping the keys to something more modern and useable such as wasd space etc.
Instead we get z x c and the arrow keys.

Me and my kids loved it, especially playing up to the point where it starts introducing the versus boss game mode.  Pretty random mechanics to the levels and obstacles you deal with and random weapons typically falling from the sky... and the ever coveted blackhole gun that even sound doesn't escape.

However, in the last several monthss webegan encountering a weird error that couldn't be rectified.  Whenever we'd click a remote to add a player it would often spawn in two, one of which was just an unmoving, unplayable character that just took up a player spot.  There were no NPCs active in the menu options.  So basically only two people could play (if we were lucky because sometimes it would spawn 2 or 3 other characters when one person entered)",1.0,Negative

- The movement feels very fluid (most of the time)

- The achievements were a lot of fun to get

[h2]CONS[/h2]
- There are some bugs (phasing through the map, hits not always registering, servers being very laggy sometimes)

- There are not that many people that play this game, so it is sometimes hard to join a quick play server

- The devs kind of left this game behind so there most likely wont be any major updates in the future

8100,Worms_Ultimate_Mayhem,"Before playing I didn't think the worms formula would work in 3 dimensions. But after playing my opinions have drastically changed. Being a remake of Worms 4, the second 3D Worms game, Team 17 has had a lot of time to refine the 3D Worms gameplay to be as cohesive and functional as possible. The game in itself is simple; eliminate the enemy team. But, what makes the game so memorable is how you go about that. You have many different weapons at your disposal to carry out your objective, with different unique attributes that make them all feel unique. The bazooka is a good all-rounder weapon, and is usually my first pick. What sets it apart from most weapons is how it is affected by the wind, meaning you may need to adapt your battle plan to the conditions for your turn. The shotgun is another solid pick, being easy to aim, and feeling wonderful when you land a shot on a pesky enemy Worm. The game uses randomly generated 3D landscapes, meaning no two matches are the same. This level of variety gives Worms Ultimate Mayhem a unique level of replayability that makes it an easy choice when I want to play something. Overall, I'd say Worms Ultimate Mayhem is worth a try, being a unique spin on the Worms formula that gives the game a distinct identity. 9 Holy Hand Grenades out of 10.",2.0,Positive

8102,Worms_Ultimate_Mayhem,"This game is amazing. Not only for my personal nostalgia but it really is funny. I like that you still can play multiplayer with your friends.

I was going to say i don't recommend it because of all the problems the game has with fullscreen issues, modern resolution issues, mouse lag and so on. But for 13 euro and 10 minutes of your time you can fix all the issues and game on like never before.

Being a remake of Worms 4, the second 3D Worms game, Team 17 has had a lot of time to refine the 3D Worms gameplay to be as cohesive and functional as possible. The game in itself is simple; eliminate the enemy team. But, what makes the game so memorable is how you go about that. You have many different weapons at your disposal to carry out your objective, with different unique attributes that make them all feel unique. The bazooka is a good all-rounder weapon, and is usually my first pick. What sets it apart from most weapons is how it is affected by the wind, meaning you may need to adapt your battle plan to the conditions for your turn. The shotgun is another solid pick, being easy to aim, and feeling wonderful when you land a shot on a pesky enemy Worm. The game uses randomly generated 3D landscapes, meaning no two matches are the same. This level of variety gives Worms Ultimate Mayhem a unique level of replayability that makes it an easy choice when I want to play something.

8398,Worms_Ultimate_Mayhem,"Before playing I didn't think the worms formula would work in 3 dimensions. But after playing my opinions have drastically changed. Being a remake of Worms 4, the second 3D Worms game, Team 17 has had a lot of time to refine the 3D Worms gameplay to be as cohesive and functional as possible. The game in itself is simple; eliminate the enemy team. But, what makes the game so memorable is how you go about that. You have many different weapons at your disposal to carry out your objective, with different unique attributes that make them all feel unique. The bazooka is a good all-rounder weapon, and is usually my first pick. What sets it apart from most weapons is how it is affected by the wind, meaning you may need to adapt your battle plan to the conditions for your turn. The shotgun is another solid pick, being easy to aim, and feeling wonderful when you land a shot on a pesky enemy Worm. The game uses randomly generated 3D landscapes, meaning no two matches are the same. This level of variety gives Worms Ultimate Mayhem a unique level of replayability that makes it an easy choice when I want to play something. Overall, I'd say Worms Ultimate Mayhem is worth a try, being a unique spin on the Worms formula that gives the game a distinct identity. 9 Holy Hand Grenades out of 10.",2.0,Positive

8701,Project Winter,"This game its really bad and can be frustrating IF YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS to play with you.
Only other players can crate servers, the problem is... There are just a few servers in the game that are created by other players, and most of then i just got kicked when i wanted to play with human beings.
Not with a good reason most of the times.
There are a few reasons why they do that:
- Dont speak too well their language
- You have a bad ping
- Dont have a mic
- They dont know you and want to play with their friends (Then why make the server public...?)
- No reason, some times they dont go with your face
Sure, this game its made and focused in the multiplayer, so of course you will want to play it with your friends, its just a shame that the community its not that welcome...
That doesn't mean you will have always a bad experience, we cant generalize eveything, and there are a lot of kind and nice people, its just rare.

It's a lot to learn, but the players I was with were more than willing to help. Maybe the traitor aspect is a bit toxic, where the traitors are expected to be good and don't get/can't expect much help. But otherwise, it seems pretty cool and I'd play it again solo or with people I know.

Only other players can crate servers, the problem is... There are just a few servers in the game that are created by other players, and most of then i just got kicked when i wanted to play with human beings.
Not with a good reason most of the times.
There are a few reasons why they do that:
- Dont speak too well their language
- You have a bad ping
- Dont have a mic
- They dont know you and want to play with their friends (Then why make the server public...?)
- No reason, some times they dont go with your face
Sure, this game its made and focused in the multiplayer, so of course you will want to play it with your friends, its just a shame that the community its not that welcome...
That doesn't mean you will have always a bad experience, we cant generalize eveything, and there are a lot of kind and nice people, its just rare.

So, in general, the game its good, you will just have a bad experience if you play alone or with random people, so, if you want to buy it, buy with your friends!",0.0,Negative

Only other players can crate servers, the problem is... There are just a few servers in the game that are created by other players, and most of then i just got kicked when i wanted to play with human beings.
Not with a good reason most of the times.
There are a few reasons why they do that:
- Dont speak too well their language
- You have a bad ping
- Dont have a mic
- They dont know you and want to play with their friends (Then why make the server public...?)
- No reason, some times they dont go with your face
Sure, this game its made and focused in the multiplayer, so of course you will want to play it with your friends, its just a shame that the community its not that welcome...
That doesn't mean you will have always a bad experience, we cant generalize eveything, and there are a lot of kind and nice people, its just rare.

So, in general, the game its good, you will just have a bad experience if you play alone or with random people, so, if you want to buy it, buy with your friends!",0.0,Negative

Not with a good reason most of the times.
There are a few reasons why they do that:
- Dont speak too well their language
- You have a bad ping
- Dont have a mic
- They dont know you and want to play with their friends (Then why make the server public...?)
- No reason, some times they dont go with your face
Sure, this game its made and focused in the multiplayer, so of course you will want to play it with your friends, its just a shame that the community its not that welcome...
That doesn't mean you will have always a bad experience, we cant generalize eveything, and there are a lot of kind and nice people, its just rare.

9000,Super Animal Royale,"It's a very fun and chill game, especially with friends! Also the player base is incredibly nice and not toxic for the most part so 10/10 for that alone.

  Here is a tip if you're just starting out, play game modes like SAW vs. Rebellion first to get used to the combat and to familiarize yourself with the weapons and power ups. That's what really helped me improve my skills quickly when I was new.",3.0,Positive
9001,Super Animal Royale,"Very cute and very easy to learn, hard to master. It's a casual and pretty fun arcadey shooter with lots of room for growth. And unlike Fortnite every 3 months, almost every SAR update is a total positive and barely changes the core game.

Matches are pretty fast-paced so action is quick and losing doesn't feel as bad. There's also always a rotating LTM that ditches squads for either a zombie infection or a 32v32 conquest game.

Progression is entirely cosmetic and the monetization is among the least predatory out of any live service game currently. There's few truly FOMO items as nearly every unlockable/purchasable item can be gotten from a rotation or working on an older season's battle pass.

9004,Super Animal Royale,"I've been around this game for a good 4-5 years now, and I can confidently say it's a wonderful experience!
The community's awesome, the dev team's very kind, the animals are super cute (and deadly!), the lore is [i]surprisingly[/i] deep, and the gameplay's nice and simple!
Awesome for when you want to jump in quick and play a 6 minute or less match!

The way Super Animal Royale does its battle passes (called Animal Passes) is also unlike most I've seen! All are permanent and purchasable via the archives through SAW Tickets when a new one releases, which I think more games should do! You can also progress the current pass and a past one [b]AT THE SAME TIME![/b]

With the Super Animal World expansion on the horizon, and a new update that released as of writing this review, now is a great time to drop in for free! You also get the newest pass (By Popular Request is what it's named) [b]FOR FREE[/b] until the expansion releases!

P.S. No, you don't have to be a furry to enjoy SAR. I'm an animal lover myself who found a game with cute animals and mythological creatures that praise a banan, and decided to play! I could be one if I wanted, but...

P.P.S. I run[url=https://twitter.com/SARNoContext] this account [/url]if you want to see examples of fun interactions that can happen within the SAR community! I hope you enjoy it!",0.0,Positive

9081,Super Animal Royale,"It's a very fun and chill game, especially with friends! Also the player base is incredibly nice and not toxic for the most part so 10/10 for that alone.

  Here is a tip if you're just starting out, play game modes like SAW vs. Rebellion first to get used to the combat and to familiarize yourself with the weapons and power ups. That's what really helped me improve my skills quickly when I was new.",3.0,Positive
9082,Super Animal Royale,"Very cute and very easy to learn, hard to master. It's a casual and pretty fun arcadey shooter with lots of room for growth. And unlike Fortnite every 3 months, almost every SAR update is a total positive and barely changes the core game.

Matches are pretty fast-paced so action is quick and losing doesn't feel as bad. There's also always a rotating LTM that ditches squads for either a zombie infection or a 32v32 conquest game.

Progression is entirely cosmetic and the monetization is among the least predatory out of any live service game currently. There's few truly FOMO items as nearly every unlockable/purchasable item can be gotten from a rotation or working on an older season's battle pass.

Awesome for when you want to jump in quick and play a 6 minute or less match!

The way Super Animal Royale does its battle passes (called Animal Passes) is also unlike most I've seen!

9154,Super Animal Royale,"Very cute and very easy to learn, hard to master. It's a casual and pretty fun arcadey shooter with lots of room for growth. And unlike Fortnite every 3 months, almost every SAR update is a total positive and barely changes the core game.

Matches are pretty fast-paced so action is quick and losing doesn't feel as bad. There's also always a rotating LTM that ditches squads for either a zombie infection or a 32v32 conquest game.

Progression is entirely cosmetic and the monetization is among the least predatory out of any live service game currently. There's few truly FOMO items as nearly every unlockable/purchasable item can be gotten from a rotation or working on an older season's battle pass.

9288,Super Animal Royale,"It's a very fun and chill game, especially with friends! Also the player base is incredibly nice and not toxic for the most part so 10/10 for that alone.

  Here is a tip if you're just starting out, play game modes like SAW vs. Rebellion first to get used to the combat and to familiarize yourself with the weapons and power ups. That's what really helped me improve my skills quickly when I was new.",3.0,Positive
9289,Super Animal Royale,"Very cute and very easy to learn, hard to master. It's a casual and pretty fun arcadey shooter with lots of room for growth. And unlike Fortnite every 3 months, almost every SAR update is a total positive and barely changes the core game.

Matches are pretty fast-paced so action is quick and losing doesn't feel as bad. There's also always a rotating LTM that ditches squads for either a zombie infection or a 32v32 conquest game.

Progression is entirely cosmetic and the monetization is among the least predatory out of any live service game currently. There's few truly FOMO items as nearly every unlockable/purchasable item can be gotten from a rotation or working on an older season's battle pass.

9292,Super Animal Royale,"I've been around this game for a good 4-5 years now, and I can confidently say it's a wonderful experience!
The community's awesome, the dev team's very kind, the animals are super cute (and deadly!), the lore is [i]surprisingly[/i] deep, and the gameplay's nice and simple!
Awesome for when you want to jump in quick and play a 6 minute or less match!

The way Super Animal Royale does its battle passes (called Animal Passes) is also unlike most I've seen! All are permanent and purchasable via the archives through SAW Tickets when a new one releases, which I think more games should do! You can also progress the current pass and a past one [b]AT THE SAME TIME![/b]

With the Super Animal World expansion on the horizon, and a new update that released as of writing this review, now is a great time to drop in for free! You also get the newest pass (By Popular Request is what it's named) [b]FOR FREE[/b] until the expansion releases!

P.S. No, you don't have to be a furry to enjoy SAR. I'm an animal lover myself who found a game with cute animals and mythological creatures that praise a banan, and decided to play! I could be one if I wanted, but...

P.P.S. I run[url=https://twitter.com/SARNoContext] this account [/url]if you want to see examples of fun interactions that can happen within the SAR community! I hope you enjoy it!",0.0,Positive

9900,Bloons TD 6,"Bloons TD 6 may be, hands down, the best tower defense game on the market. Ninja Kiwi is an incredibly involved and dedicated dev team that consistently adds engaging and fun updates that increase community involvement, and overall fun of the game. It's a perfect game to turn your brain off and watch monkeys pop bloons, though there are also challenging and competitive aspects that allow sweatier players to enjoy the game as well.

That being said, I would definitely recommend that you buy when it goes on sale, as it does rather often.",22.0,Positive

9936,Bloons TD 6,"That game I played as a kid has really grown up. This is very much the best version of bloons, the harder levels are still a major challenge after putting hundreds of hours into this game. At first I was a bit put off by the unlock mechanics, but it's not grindy at all, you will unlock a towers full capability after using it like 1 or 2 times. 
One of my favorite things is infinite mode after beating the 40-100 rounds (difficulty changes how many rounds you need to be) it is really fun to get up in the like 250+ round range, like looping in risk of rain.

Frequent, good updates keep things fresh, and it is clear the devs care about the games integrity. None of the updates suck, balance is always kept in mind. 

NinjaKiwi also has an archive here on steam if you want to play older bloons because they are cool devs. <3",0.0,Positive

9945,Bloons TD 6,"Alright, Bloons TD 6—solid game, super fun, but let’s be real for a second. Why are monkeys and balloons at war? What kind of universe are we living in where highly-trained monkeys are popping balloons with everything from darts to laser cannons? Like, who started this beef? Did a balloon insult a monkey’s family or something?

All that aside, the gameplay’s a blast. Strategizing the perfect monkey army to fend off the endless waves of balloons (bloons, sorry) is oddly satisfying. But seriously, can we get some backstory on this war? I need answers.

Now lets talk about the voice lines, they are simply perfect for example this Quincy lie ""Are you kidding me? Nothing gets past my bow!"". From this line you can gather that he has a bow that nothing gets past BUT if you look deeper into the line it highlights his confidence.

Title: “Bloons Tower Defense 6: A Towering Disappointment”

I can’t believe I wasted hours of my life on this glorified balloon-popping simulator. Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to make an entire game around popping balloons? The plot is non-existent, and the graphics look like they were designed by a toddler with a crayon.

The towers? Ugh. There are so many options that it feels less like strategy and more like a game of “What the heck do I even do?” I spent more time trying to figure out which towers to use than actually enjoying the game. And the bloons? They just keep coming—like a bad rash you can’t get rid of.

The sound design is equally atrocious. Those repetitive sound effects could drive anyone to madness. I swear I heard the same bloon popping sound so many times, I started to question my sanity.

Oh, and don’t get me started on the microtransactions. I thought I was buying a game, not signing up for a money-sucking black hole.

If you enjoy wasting your time on something that feels more like a chore than a game, then sure, give Bloons Tower Defense 6 a shot. But for the rest of us with better things to do, I’d recommend avoiding this balloon-filled mess at all costs.

9977,Bloons TD 6,"A cozy, chill game to either have running in the background while you work on other stuff or to play actively. At first I got this game to play with some friends as a meme but when they dropped it, I just continued playing it. It's easy to put it in the background and just alt tab in whenever you need to defend. 

Pros: 
- banger music, banger graphics, good level designs (for most of them). 
- diverse monkey designs with interesting mechanics for each. They're also so cute. 
- game is constantly updating so metas change, new maps and heroes are added, occassionally new event game modes. 
- account linking and the cloud is a fantastic, seamless system. 

Cons: 
- can be grindy given the achievements and the gamemode. Like I personally only do the weekly odysseys bc it's just afk matter. 
- freeplay rounds start to get laggy and once you get into the 175s+, it's really laggy. 

For a platinum, achievement hunter, it's actually not that bad. A lot of the times, you're afking (once you get to the grinding and you're past the learning portion of monkey metas and their niches). I will continue to play the game even after platinum.",0.0,Positive

The tower mechanics and all the upgrades make it feel unique, and it’s fun figuring out the best combos.

9991,Bloons TD 6,"Not a big fan of the XP system for towers, and the events are very difficult if you don't have a guide and are starting out. Most of the gamemodes are entertaining, and all of the heroes are useable. Upgrade tips for starting players:

Dart: Sharpshooter with faster firing upgrades is good for early game rounds, but needs support for grey bloons

Tack: Overdrive with faster firing upgrades is good for shredding BFBs and MOABs, but struggles against dense clusters of bloons

Boomerang: MOAB Press with faster throwing upgrades is one of the best options for stalling blimps; doesn't stall BADs

Ice Monkey: Embrittlement temporarily lowers defense of bloons in radius per hit; works well with any DPS tower

Ninja: Bloonjitsu with seeking shurikens is very reliable start on easier maps, especially when buffed by Alchemist's Berserker Brew

Alchemist: Berserker Brew is the best buff in the game for its price, use on main DPS

Helicopter: Moab Shove stalls MOABs stupidly well, but needs to be backed up by DPS towers

Boat: Destroyer with hot shot destroys early-midgame rounds

Druid: Druid of the Jungle is famously good early-game tower because of global vine attack ability

Banana Farm: marketplace upgrade is best for beginners; spam these for ever-increasing profits, then sell for big payout so you can afford a Tier 5 upgrade on a DPS tower (ex. Druid of the Forest, Flagship Carrier).

Wizard: Dragon's Breath with monkey sense is very reliable DPS, especially with Berserker brew buff, but you will likely sell between round 50-60 for better stuff

10035,Bloons TD 6,"That game I played as a kid has really grown up. This is very much the best version of bloons, the harder levels are still a major challenge after putting hundreds of hours into this game.

One of my favorite things is infinite mode after beating the 40-100 rounds (difficulty changes how many rounds you need to be) it is really fun to get up in the like 250+ round range, like looping in risk of rain.

Frequent, good updates keep things fresh, and it is clear the devs care about the games integrity. None of the updates suck, balance is always kept in mind.

10044,Bloons TD 6,"Alright, Bloons TD 6—solid game, super fun, but let’s be real for a second. Why are monkeys and balloons at war? What kind of universe are we living in where highly-trained monkeys are popping balloons with everything from darts to laser cannons? Like, who started this beef? Did a balloon insult a monkey’s family or something?

All that aside, the gameplay’s a blast. Strategizing the perfect monkey army to fend off the endless waves of balloons (bloons, sorry) is oddly satisfying. But seriously, can we get some backstory on this war? I need answers.

Now lets talk about the voice lines, they are simply perfect for example this Quincy lie ""Are you kidding me? Nothing gets past my bow!"". From this line you can gather that he has a bow that nothing gets past BUT if you look deeper into the line it highlights his confidence.

Title: “Bloons Tower Defense 6: A Towering Disappointment”

I can’t believe I wasted hours of my life on this glorified balloon-popping simulator. Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to make an entire game around popping balloons? The plot is non-existent, and the graphics look like they were designed by a toddler with a crayon.

The towers? Ugh. There are so many options that it feels less like strategy and more like a game of “What the heck do I even do?” I spent more time trying to figure out which towers to use than actually enjoying the game. And the bloons? They just keep coming—like a bad rash you can’t get rid of.

The sound design is equally atrocious. Those repetitive sound effects could drive anyone to madness. I swear I heard the same bloon popping sound so many times, I started to question my sanity.

Oh, and don’t get me started on the microtransactions. I thought I was buying a game, not signing up for a money-sucking black hole.

If you enjoy wasting your time on something that feels more like a chore than a game, then sure, give Bloons Tower Defense 6 a shot. But for the rest of us with better things to do, I’d recommend avoiding this balloon-filled mess at all costs.

10076,Bloons TD 6,"A cozy, chill game to either have running in the background while you work on other stuff or to play actively. At first I got this game to play with some friends as a meme but when they dropped it, I just continued playing it. It's easy to put it in the background and just alt tab in whenever you need to defend. 

Pros: 
- banger music, banger graphics, good level designs (for most of them). 
- diverse monkey designs with interesting mechanics for each. They're also so cute. 
- game is constantly updating so metas change, new maps and heroes are added, occassionally new event game modes. 
- account linking and the cloud is a fantastic, seamless system. 

Cons: 
- can be grindy given the achievements and the gamemode. Like I personally only do the weekly odysseys bc it's just afk matter. 
- freeplay rounds start to get laggy and once you get into the 175s+, it's really laggy. 

For a platinum, achievement hunter, it's actually not that bad. A lot of the times, you're afking (once you get to the grinding and you're past the learning portion of monkey metas and their niches). I will continue to play the game even after platinum.",0.0,Positive

10090,Bloons TD 6,"Not a big fan of the XP system for towers, and the events are very difficult if you don't have a guide and are starting out. Most of the gamemodes are entertaining, and all of the heroes are useable. Upgrade tips for starting players:

Dart: Sharpshooter with faster firing upgrades is good for early game rounds, but needs support for grey bloons

Tack: Overdrive with faster firing upgrades is good for shredding BFBs and MOABs, but struggles against dense clusters of bloons

Boomerang: MOAB Press with faster throwing upgrades is one of the best options for stalling blimps; doesn't stall BADs

Ice Monkey: Embrittlement temporarily lowers defense of bloons in radius per hit; works well with any DPS tower

Ninja: Bloonjitsu with seeking shurikens is very reliable start on easier maps, especially when buffed by Alchemist's Berserker Brew

Alchemist: Berserker Brew is the best buff in the game for its price, use on main DPS

Helicopter: Moab Shove stalls MOABs stupidly well, but needs to be backed up by DPS towers

Boat: Destroyer with hot shot destroys early-midgame rounds

Druid: Druid of the Jungle is famously good early-game tower because of global vine attack ability

Banana Farm: marketplace upgrade is best for beginners; spam these for ever-increasing profits, then sell for big payout so you can afford a Tier 5 upgrade on a DPS tower (ex. Druid of the Forest, Flagship Carrier).

Wizard: Dragon's Breath with monkey sense is very reliable DPS, especially with Berserker brew buff, but you will likely sell between round 50-60 for better stuff

10135,Bloons TD 6,"That game I played as a kid has really grown up. This is very much the best version of bloons, the harder levels are still a major challenge after putting hundreds of hours into this game.

One of my favorite things is infinite mode after beating the 40-100 rounds (difficulty changes how many rounds you need to be) it is really fun to get up in the like 250+ round range, like looping in risk of rain.

Frequent, good updates keep things fresh, and it is clear the devs care about the games integrity. None of the updates suck, balance is always kept in mind.

10144,Bloons TD 6,"Alright, Bloons TD 6—solid game, super fun, but let’s be real for a second. Why are monkeys and balloons at war? What kind of universe are we living in where highly-trained monkeys are popping balloons with everything from darts to laser cannons? Like, who started this beef? Did a balloon insult a monkey’s family or something?

All that aside, the gameplay’s a blast. Strategizing the perfect monkey army to fend off the endless waves of balloons (bloons, sorry) is oddly satisfying. But seriously, can we get some backstory on this war? I need answers.

Title: “Bloons Tower Defense 6: A Towering Disappointment”

I can’t believe I wasted hours of my life on this glorified balloon-popping simulator. Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to make an entire game around popping balloons? The plot is non-existent, and the graphics look like they were designed by a toddler with a crayon.

The towers? Ugh. There are so many options that it feels less like strategy and more like a game of “What the heck do I even do?” I spent more time trying to figure out which towers to use than actually enjoying the game. And the bloons? They just keep coming—like a bad rash you can’t get rid of.

The sound design is equally atrocious. Those repetitive sound effects could drive anyone to madness. I swear I heard the same bloon popping sound so many times, I started to question my sanity.

Oh, and don’t get me started on the microtransactions. I thought I was buying a game, not signing up for a money-sucking black hole.

If you enjoy wasting your time on something that feels more like a chore than a game, then sure, give Bloons Tower Defense 6 a shot. But for the rest of us with better things to do, I’d recommend avoiding this balloon-filled mess at all costs.

10176,Bloons TD 6,"A cozy, chill game to either have running in the background while you work on other stuff or to play actively. At first I got this game to play with some friends as a meme but when they dropped it, I just continued playing it. It's easy to put it in the background and just alt tab in whenever you need to defend. 

Pros: 
- banger music, banger graphics, good level designs (for most of them). 
- diverse monkey designs with interesting mechanics for each. They're also so cute. 
- game is constantly updating so metas change, new maps and heroes are added, occassionally new event game modes. 
- account linking and the cloud is a fantastic, seamless system. 

Cons: 
- can be grindy given the achievements and the gamemode. Like I personally only do the weekly odysseys bc it's just afk matter. 
- freeplay rounds start to get laggy and once you get into the 175s+, it's really laggy. 

For a platinum, achievement hunter, it's actually not that bad. A lot of the times, you're afking (once you get to the grinding and you're past the learning portion of monkey metas and their niches). I will continue to play the game even after platinum.",0.0,Positive

10184,Bloons TD 6,It randomly miss detects your account as a modded account when you log from a different device into another device. The restrictions are ridiculously high for cheating.

10185,Bloons TD 6,"TBH, Bloons TD 6 is super addicting. There’s so much content, and it just never gets old. Whether if it’s maps, challenges, or trying new strategies, you’re always busy. What I really like is how different it is from other tower defense games that ive played like PVZ. The tower mechanics and all the upgrades make it feel unique, and it’s fun figuring out the best combos. Overall, it’s a really creative and well made game that keeps the player coming back/returning. If you’re into tower defense, this one is a must play!",0.0,Positive

10188,Bloons TD 6,"idk man the concept behind the game is quite interesting the lore of the bloons attacking so assumed colony, town, and or village of monkeys just foesnt make sense hat did the monkeys do why do the bloons hater them so much hy do we help them defend against them what if we are the enemys here and we were never told this says alot about our society we are all sheep among richer sheperds they tells us to do it and we defend against the bloons idk man i just think maybe we should all just sit down eat a poptart and relax while slaughtering these bloon families just take the punches as they come.

great game though",0.0,Positive

10190,Bloons TD 6,"Not a big fan of the XP system for towers, and the events are very difficult if you don't have a guide and are starting out. Most of the gamemodes are entertaining, and all of the heroes are useable. Upgrade tips for starting players:

Dart: Sharpshooter with faster firing upgrades is good for early game rounds, but needs support for grey bloons

Tack: Overdrive with faster firing upgrades is good for shredding BFBs and MOABs, but struggles against dense clusters of bloons

Boomerang: MOAB Press with faster throwing upgrades is one of the best options for stalling blimps; doesn't stall BADs

Ice Monkey: Embrittlement temporarily lowers defense of bloons in radius per hit; works well with any DPS tower

Ninja: Bloonjitsu with seeking shurikens is very reliable start on easier maps, especially when buffed by Alchemist's Berserker Brew

Alchemist: Berserker Brew is the best buff in the game for its price, use on main DPS

Helicopter: Moab Shove stalls MOABs stupidly well, but needs to be backed up by DPS towers

Boat: Destroyer with hot shot destroys early-midgame rounds

Druid: Druid of the Jungle is famously good early-game tower because of global vine attack ability

Banana Farm: marketplace upgrade is best for beginners; spam these for ever-increasing profits, then sell for big payout so you can afford a Tier 5 upgrade on a DPS tower (ex. Druid of the Forest, Flagship Carrier).

Wizard: Dragon's Breath with monkey sense is very reliable DPS, especially with Berserker brew buff, but you will likely sell between round 50-60 for better stuff
