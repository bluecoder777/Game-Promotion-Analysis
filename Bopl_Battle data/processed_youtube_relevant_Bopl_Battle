            "body": "Yo, could you just cut the crap? We know youre lying. And if you try to defend yourself again, let me give a solid list of reasons your lying, and if you find a counter to all of them, I might believe you. Your son joined the Bopl modding discord server a while back, and claimed that you died over a month ago. So, if thats the case, how did you send this now? We also know that he is not your son because he had links to YOUR accounts in his discord account. Now, call me crazy, but I dont think somebody would let their son link all their parents accounts to his discord. Now, you claim to have a terminal illness. That stuff is just really bad to lie about. Like, for real, why? Youve claimed to be dying before, youve claimed to be dead before, and what has it given you? Literally nothing. Maybe if there were some signs that some of the other stuff you said were true then I wouldnt think the terminal illness is a lie, but come on man, its such an overused way of getting attention. Also, it should be stated that there was a mod with the name MoreBopl uploaded to thunderstore recently the author is not you. It literally shows who made it, and oh, what do you know, your name is nowhere to be found on that entire platform! The mod doesnt even work anyways, its a joke mod. Instead of increasing the max player count, it actually sets it down to 1. You just saw it had the name and decided to try and make people think that you had finally did it! And then, when you realized that it doesnt work, decided to make yourself look like the victim again. Cut the crap man, everybody knows the truth.",

But if it is the stream that is having the issue try streaming it to them on discord while they connect through the remote play",
