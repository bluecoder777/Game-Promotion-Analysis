I actually need it to improve. So at your merit, \"video too long\" is a valid complaint, but you were a dick about it so you got it back. There's a massive difference between constructive criticism and just being a dick.\n\nI don't care about blowing up on YouTube, I have an actual job that wouldn't allow me the time to make videos full time anyway. I make them because it's fun, so you can't expect me to cater to your short attention span. Maybe I should have called it a montage, maybe I should have only posted just the clip. Who cares. I dont.

This means that there will be no more updates. Which means no anticheat tech. No new levels. No events. No glitch fixes. Nothing. This really makes me wonder where crab game is headed. I feel bad thinking that the users might revert back to playing something like Valorant or Apex. But crab game was legit so funny. I badly wish this game doesn't die out anytime soon.",

            "body": "(Speaking from experience) The player limit has multiple purposes, not just to minimize the host's lag. I joined a hacked megaserver recently that accommodates just under 1000 players. With just 50 players, I started experiencing significant frame drop. I have 16gb of ram which majority of players have. Several games later, we hit the 60 players mark and the first game my screen was completely frozen and I could only see and use chat. Chat was going haywire too and majority just quit. Even if a lot of players might sound cool, it's an extremely bad idea not just because of lag, you also run the risk of getting banned. I saw a video of the host of a megaserver get banned. So yeah just don't seriously",

Just join a crab game discord server from another country, theres 100% bound to be a channel about sharing lobby codes, go to that server and boom... Ur now playing in another region, this is easy to do since the game doesnt really have a region lock feature.\n\nThough of course, since ur playing on another region, ur most likely going to get like 500+ ping the entire game lol",

            "body": "You know the freeze tech yet? It's arguably more broken than water tech tbh. Just go into windowed mode (shortcut alt-enter) RIGHT CLICK on the title tab at the top of the crab game client, and you won't take knockback while you're right clicking. However when you click off from the top bar all the knockback  you would've received will apply all at once and you'll fly off in whichever direction. On stepping stones you can skip the while thing if you coordinate properly with a friend. I don't believe it's on YouTube yet.\n\nAlso if you do it while in the lobby while it transitions into a actual game you won't spawn in and you'll just die at the start.",

            "body": "In all honesty, it's REALLY TOXIC. \n\nThe only way to have fun/play the game is to have and invite only server with alot of friends. even the friendliest servers have two or more TOXIC people in it. and there is ALOT of things in this game to come up with that.\n\n1. Slurs and Comments\n2. Gameplay\n3. \"kys\" sayings\n4. Hacking and other gameplay\n\nFirst and almost important is the slurs, this one really isn't a problem for me but for ALLLLLOOOOT of people. There is waaay too many people saying racial slurs like \"Ni\\*\\*er\" or \"Fa\\*\\*ot\". but it's almost only aimed towards people of color.\n\nSecond is the main gameplay. the game modes are REALLY enjoyable sometimes, but too many glitches and bugs happen in the gameplay. Like being flung out of the map or trying to push someone and they don't budge. And the sad thing about this is that people will accuse you of hacking when a simple game breaking glitch happens {which has happened to me multiple times}.\n\nNow for the \"kill yourself\" sayings. This has happened to me and others on this game alot of times. And it always starts with a random no braincell argument that happens and the person who gets it said to doesn't even deserve it. I was having fun in a sever with almost no toxic energy going on, it was all fun and cheerful and we were just trying to get crates. Then out of nowhere two kids start mocking me and calling me a FAG and dumbass for no reason and multiple people seem to hate it Aswell and then leave. But before i leave they send me \"kys\". \n\nNow this one is kind of important but not really. people hack ALOT in this game and the more I have been playing this game the more I realize how EASY it is to hack on this game. You can quite literally look up how to mod/hack in this game and it'll show up a 1 MINUTE VIDEO.\n\nAnd it's kind of sad to that you can't really enjoy the game without getting hated on. And the reason most people don't mute people is because it kind of ruins the interactions with the game as you will, people could quite literally be talking shit about you because of a minor thing you did without you knowing. And it's really sad how the only way you can enjoy this game is too mute and play only with friends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is only for the people who don't like getting randomly getting harassed on a video game and for the people who agree with the main opinion.",

Because if you're a normal person just playing with friends for the funny games it gets real awkward to try and ignore the dude yelling racist shit and running around, so normal people just end up quitting the game for something a tad bit more civilized.",
