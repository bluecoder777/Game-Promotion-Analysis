The rule where landing on the winning platform guard rail not counting is stupid. When in an actual server hosted game, the game registers you on the guard rail as finishing. I recognize that it is my fault for not making myself aware of the rule however, I still hold my opinion.

submission,Warm_Link_3724,End of Crab Game (how and why),"Hey yall i just want to let yall know what actually happened with crab game. Every tuesday steam makes a maintenance (i dont really know why tho since it always causes new problems instead of fixing old ones) and so around 2 months ago steam made a classic maintenance and since that maintenance crab game isnt the same anymore; in most lobbies half of the lobby is floating and sometimes you are the one floating in other people's pov which can be dogshit especially for modes like lights out cause where ever you are in the map people see u floating and not moving so they can kill u and you will die same thing for them. That's not all; there's also people that figured out ways to farm boxes using thousands of bots daily; the goal is to unbox shinies that they will sell later (knowning some can be sold 300$+ usd you can understand why they do that and so thats a reason why theres so much ''players'' playing the game). And as we all know dani dont give a damn about this game or any other so i guess he wont do anything about it and steam (who fucked the game with their maintenance) also wont do anything so its ggs for the people like me who had a lot of rare shinies that were expensive well it was a waste of time and money. So game is more dead than it ever been the only way to play it is by doing a lobby with like 10 slots max so theres 10 people that dont lag and you can enjoy but its ass.

I played that game since the beginning and there has always been a pretty big community around it where everybody know each other so even if dani wasnt there we were having fun enjoying the game and making money by buying and reselling shinies but since that maintenance everyone just quitted except the shinies farmers (the ones who broke the game using thousands of bots and they will keep doing it cause there is still some dumbasses that keep wasting hundreds of dollars to buy shinies even if the game is dead)

Would be dope if dani or steam do something but at this point i dont even wanna play crab game no more or give steam or dani more money cause they dont even deserve it.",2024-05-09 00:22:46,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/crabgame/comments/1cnjwut/end_of_crab_game_how_and_why/

Also there are 25 golden fedoras that are worth around 200 to 300 each, there are also xmas shinies some are worth more than 2k$ and the regular shinies (the one that are being farmed by bots) are between 1$ to 1k+$ also",2024-05-09 00:38:05,1,

submission,SomeoneCalledGustav,Crab Game Tournament,"Hello everyone!

You may not know me, but those of who are apart of the ""Muck"" subreddit may know me as the guy who hosted a Muck battle royale. That didn't work out because I put CET as the time zone instead of CEST (Central European Summer Time). Well now I'm back again and trying to make a tournament again!

For those of you interested, my plan for the event is the following:

\- The tournament is made up of 5 main rounds, after which the players who came 1:st and 2:nd in each main round get to play in a final game.

\- All gamemodes and maps wil be turned on, to make it so that no one gets a disadvantage.

\- All cheating is strongly prohibited, and if a cheater is caught they will be banned ASAP.

\- At the moment, the event doesn't have a prize support. This is just for fun!

\- The event day is not yet determined.

If you think I missed something, please let me know! And if you are interested to participate, you can talk to me on Discord (Gustav#0888).

&#x200B;

I hope I get to fight you!

\-Gustav

But Crab Fight is not even hard and I survive the gamemode 99% of the time, because it's on the same difficulty as ""Big Chunk"" bossfight (from Muck ofc) which is a very easy boss if you haven't played Muck before. 

And it's boring for me, because TanTan's attack are so easy to dodge, it's literally just run away from him for a bit, then jump occasionally, so you're just left there to spam snowballs mindlessly with little aim required because TanTan is huge.",2022-05-03 20:06:09,2,

I don't care about blowing up on YouTube, I have an actual job that wouldn't allow me the time to make videos full time anyway.

submission,Miserable_Ad_3305,CRAB GAME THERE COULD BE A NEW UPDATE?,"Hey guys I noticed that This Easter Egg from Lava Climb, It's in the back at the spawn well, you could notice that before and that Isn't really new but I noticed that It's Cosmetics changed.

[you see these 2 pictures right here. it posted  5 months ago which is probably like December 2021 - 2022](https://preview.redd.it/d8e023kkumt81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=210a84dc76cafe6f413749eace1c8cc6ab2ae1aa)

[and then this  I screenshotted it like 1 month ago, if you don't notice the differences you could see that here it has a backpack which is we haven't seen before and it seems new](https://preview.redd.it/ntoiv7lrumt81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=574a6d43b3338fc141240289eb436a2bd0a894ec)

[There's also some items before that didn't got screenshotted. so I can't show it but from what I really remember this guy right here or this dummy it has a beanie and different shoes before. so yeah.. I think that's what  I could explain at it. really hard to explain but I think there will be a next update for crab game, if that is true that will be very cool I really hope there is. also its not confirmed that there will be a next update just because of this. ](https://preview.redd.it/cotuys9xumt81.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=025cbc23f0dea61d7ee38a8e1269af3d3e25c197)

But I really do think that there will be a next update because it's a really big opportunity for dani to grow and Crab Game do be really fun at all it just lack some updates and stuff.

this picture was taken before the customization update, which signalled a customization update. Since customization has been added this easter egg is just a funny teaser for the big update.

comment,neuromat0n,"Is the Doppler effect on sounds in ""Red Light, Green Light"" deliberate or accidental?","ok I have figured it out I think. So there are invisible objects being sent from the statue towards the playing field. Those are sent in waves at a certain speed. And when they hit a player, it will register their position, and it will play a sound. If, between two waves, the player changed their position by more than a certain amount, they will be eliminated. That is the only explanation that makes sense. It's basically a motion detector in form of an algorithm. If that's the way it is done then I respect the ingenuity. I still wonder why though. It could have been done with less effort.

edit: forgot that it is not only about motion but also visibility. So this actually is the best solution.",2022-04-20 14:26:17,1,

As much as I love this game, you can't deny it's death is inevitable (Thanos not intended) I say this because Dani's real game is Karlson and he already said that these games will be like a side project despite the efforts.

Alright y'know what, we were this close to getting Crab Game's longevity increased by probably another full year if brain dead players didn't complain about every decision that Dani made in the game, them doing that is another Major reason why Dani quit Crab game. He adds Bustling Buttons, they complain (ngl it's a gamemode but eh) he removes Standoff, they complain (ok standoff sucks good riddance, Snowball Supremacy) now you get me?

Also don't get me started with those Snowflakes who are complaining non stop about gamers being Gamers (saying slurs in game) like these people would instantly faint the moment they catch a glimpse of the old CoD experience lol",2022-04-06 12:24:44,4,

This means that there will be no more updates. Which means no anticheat tech. No new levels. No events. No glitch fixes. Nothing. This really makes me wonder where crab game is headed. I feel bad thinking that the users might revert back to playing something like Valorant or Apex. But crab game was legit so funny.

I have 16gb of ram which majority of players have. Several games later, we hit the 60 players mark and the first game my screen was completely frozen and I could only see and use chat. Chat was going haywire too and majority just quit. Even if a lot of players might sound cool, it's an extremely bad idea not just because of lag, you also run the risk of getting banned.

It could have been any number of things but there are a lot of toxic people that play crab game so there's not much rhyme or reason to what they do unless it involves being hateful. Best thing to do is to keep it moving. Sorry that happened though.

comment,Belgain_Roffles,movement cringe,"I've been genuinely confused about labeling people as ""movement players."" The game is literally about moving and slapping with a dash of throwing added for flavor. 

Movement is a core competency of the game, it's not a ""choice"" to be a movement player or not. If you don't learn to sidestep crouch jump, (even ignoring the other mechanics) you are basically never going to win. Essentially you can't be good at the game if you're not a ""movement player.""",2022-01-27 03:53:16,5,
comment,itsZerozone,movement cringe,"Agreed, and this is very true, crab game is almost a karlson game where movement is the name of the game. I say almost because the game now has ""aim focused"" gamemodes like snowbrawl and dodgeball, i honestly really like those 2.

But anyway, whats with these types of players loathing on the movement element of the game? When this game is almost 100% movement based?

85-90% usage is more than normal for any game that you don’t limit the performance for. As for the miner, don’t know what you mean antivirus has found one, I don’t believe it’d be related to crab game unless it’s mimicking that program, even then that is unlikely.

I have 3d modeling software and I know how to model the geometry, I won't get into thinking about textures and stuff yet. 

But I don't know if there is a way to load custom map files into the game. Does anyone if this would be possible? Also, I wouldn't know how to make any moving parts, like sweepers, but for now I just want to test getting some geometry in and trying to make custom levels. I think it could be a lot of fun, I think race is the best mode, and want to make some longer levels that emphasize the sliding mechanics and just curious if this is possible.

comment,Belgain_Roffles,Standoff - Why the removal?,I disagree and feel the only redeeming quality of dodgeball is that by eliminating half the players it makes the rest of the rounds end a lot faster. With a lot of players no matter how good you are individually it’s still just a coin flip whether you win or lose. With few players it’s absolutely broken when there are an odd number of players as both a 2v1 or 3v2 are bullshit.

And my RNG on crates is so shitty that ive been grinding boxes from the day cosmetics were introduced into the game and NOT a single item that is actually rare, like Legendary or above rarity items.

Also i still find it amazing that players still cant do anything about the ""money"" that they got from winning a game.

submission,SumPup1,[Discussion] Best Gamemodes in my Opinion (2022),"Here are my top picks for Crab Game gamemodes. 

I have about 200 hours which I think is pretty okay(ish). I know some people have wayyy more but I think it's good enough so rank all of the gamemodes.

**Bold** = Great Gamemode

*Italics* = Solid Gamemode

Normal = Mid

~~Strikethrough~~ = Bustling Buttons

Any suggestions, disagreements, or concerns about this list?

1. **Race** \- Pure skill with minor exceptions
2. **Floor is Lava** \- Also pure skill and jumping tech
3. **Lights Out** \- More skill than Floor is Lava but a bit less fun
4. **Stepping Stones** \- Underrated. Lots of jump tech and strategy.
5. **Tag** \- Classic, skill, but really stressful
6. **Hat King** \- Nice twist to tag.
7. **Hide N' Seek** \- Downtime and short timer makes it too stressful
8. *Bomb Tag* \- Lots of luck and only 30 seconds to tag.
9. *King of the Hill* \- Community hates this one. I like it a bit more than most.
10. *Red Light Green Light* \- Really good; other than the amount of pushing tech.
11. *Death From Above* \- Block Drop but better and has more skill. Still a lot of RNG.
12. Block Drop - No good strategy + really stressful. Push tech aswell and some RNG
13. Dodgeball - Impossible to kill a player who can properly dodge & unbalanced teams. 
14. Snow Brawl - Too stressful and suffers from the dodging issue.
15. Tile Drive - Muck green.
16. ~~Bustling Buttons~~ \- Entirely RNG. No skill, no proper order to those who go, nothing. Just filler.",2022-01-01 20:02:34,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crabgame/comments/rtr6mt/discussion_best_gamemodes_in_my_opinion_2022/

But i still have a downside when im hosting tho, and its the frequent low player count despite the player slot being 40, its definitely because of the 24/7 lobbies being hosted by a ""famous"" host who are hogging all the players that wouldve come to my lobby.

comment,JasperNoodles,Think there will ever be a trading scene?,"The issue with the Crab establishing a viable trading economy is the current over saturation of cosmetics. Everyone in the game can get multiple crates per day. While there is plenty of demand in the market, Dani fucked up any potential of a stable economy because there is quite literally no scarcity.

A new system needs to be designed for crate distribution. 

My proposal is that we create a key system similar to CS:GO. The only way that keys may be obtained is by purchasing them with in game ""winnings"". Lets hypothetically say a key costs $100m of in game currency.  Dani has already implemented a system where the winner is awarded $1m per participant in each lobby which provides a protection system of people farming 3 man lobbies.

All off the fundamentals are already set into place. MAKE WEEBS RICH AGAIN",2021-12-11 14:04:23,0,

Translation: ""Hey Neymar, talk to me"" , then he says ""Hey, what's up"" and - because he's the most famous Brazilian alive right now - his voice is shockingly similar, so that's the surprise and really what made me suspect it was actually him and look for it on his official Steam account. Then I asked him if it was actually him and he said ""Yes, of course"" but I still had to confirm. Turns out he was telling the truth, kek.

Perhaps it only depends on ping and the amount of people in the server. But it's very inconsistent. If pushing had a proper consistent feel to it. Then i wouldn't be against it because it actually would take skill and knowledge to use. Now it's just push someone and hope for the best.,2021-12-01 21:22:17,-1,

3. Region-locked servers

4. Sort servers by nation (this could be changed later on)

5. Support for emojis and letters in other ways of writing (if the emoji thing dosent work, a prebuilt emoji tab with costom emojis (or use a prefix to make emojis (exmple: :smile:)

if the game made them NOT TRADABLE OR MARKETEABLE it would have been the same thing of not get a specific cosmetic

being tradable and marketeable just make it more easy to get

submission,None,Does anyone else experience this problem,"entity pushing has become a big problem for me where i can't move, block or even win a 1v1 push battle on the lava floor game mode or the 50/50 game mode, basically i can't entity push player but they can entity push the hell out of me, which is frustrating and it's even worse when trying to play the obstacle courses when there's 30-40 players still alive, i just get pushed around with no real way to combat it, i wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same thing and how can i fix it

TL;DR entity pushing does not favor me but favors other players",2021-11-27 17:13:18,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/crabgame/comments/r3hysq/does_anyone_else_experience_this_problem/

I could see it on my player screen that they were in the lobby but i could not see them via the Server Host Screen.

The only way to get rid of them was to kill the server and recreate and just hope they dont rejoin or if they do then hope they show in the player list.

It would be good to have a Command kick function such as ""/kick #4"" etc so then your not going thru the player list via Tab and just kicking the players number once you find out what it is",2021-11-27 00:30:27,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/crabgame/comments/r30tty/hosting_games_unable_to_see_all_players/

comment,ardyndidnothingwrong,My opinion: Crab game is incredibly toxic.,"The most interesting part to me is the people that have responded to your post saying ""toxicity is fun"". The problem must be far more ingrained than I thought if people actively defend it and aren't ashamed of it. Like, to me saying ""I'm toxic"" or ""I like toxicity"" is basically saying ""I'm a racist"" or ""I'm a bad person""... but of course people wouldn't ever say those things with pride, but if toxicity is something people are proud of, we are VERY far from getting rid of the problem.",2021-12-02 02:10:44,1,
comment,I_Zilo_I,My opinion: Crab game is incredibly toxic.,"In all honesty, it's REALLY TOXIC. 

The only way to have fun/play the game is to have and invite only server with alot of friends. even the friendliest servers have two or more TOXIC people in it. and there is ALOT of things in this game to come up with that.

1. Slurs and Comments
2. Gameplay
3. ""kys"" sayings
4. Hacking and other gameplay

First and almost important is the slurs, this one really isn't a problem for me but for ALLLLLOOOOT of people. There is waaay too many people saying racial slurs like ""Ni\*\*er"" or ""Fa\*\*ot"". but it's almost only aimed towards people of color.

Second is the main gameplay. the game modes are REALLY enjoyable sometimes, but too many glitches and bugs happen in the gameplay. Like being flung out of the map or trying to push someone and they don't budge. And the sad thing about this is that people will accuse you of hacking when a simple game breaking glitch happens {which has happened to me multiple times}.

Now for the ""kill yourself"" sayings. This has happened to me and others on this game alot of times. And it always starts with a random no braincell argument that happens and the person who gets it said to doesn't even deserve it. I was having fun in a sever with almost no toxic energy going on, it was all fun and cheerful and we were just trying to get crates. Then out of nowhere two kids start mocking me and calling me a FAG and dumbass for no reason and multiple people seem to hate it Aswell and then leave. But before i leave they send me ""kys"". 

Now this one is kind of important but not really. people hack ALOT in this game and the more I have been playing this game the more I realize how EASY it is to hack on this game. You can quite literally look up how to mod/hack in this game and it'll show up a 1 MINUTE VIDEO.

And it's kind of sad to that you can't really enjoy the game without getting hated on. And the reason most people don't mute people is because it kind of ruins the interactions with the game as you will, people could quite literally be talking shit about you because of a minor thing you did without you knowing. And it's really sad how the only way you can enjoy this game is too mute and play only with friends. 

&#x200B;

This is only for the people who don't like getting randomly getting harassed on a video game and for the people who agree with the main opinion.",2021-12-29 06:36:26,1,

comment,MicrockYT,Personal Tierlist including the new gamemodes (reasoning in comments),"BING CHILLING Tier: Pretty much every gamemode here requires skill and I love that, so yea

A Tier: Not my favourites but id like playing them/wouldnt care, even tho Hat king and Stick tag get kinda repetitive

B Tier: Bomb Tag is here because it has the RNG factor of not knowing when the bomb its gonna explode (thats the point of the gamemode), and everything that has RNG involved in some type of way I dislike it atleast a bit. Stepping stones is not lower because you can make your way through either baiting everyone or bhopping to only 1 instead of 3 in the short version (from 16.67% chance to only 50% \[these chances might be wrong, correct me if so\]). Red light Green light is just boring to play unless you push people off, kinda straight forward.

C Tier: Who camps the most and has the better ping wins lol

D Tier: Depends on your team, pretty ""rng"" based

hold my wood Tier: Bustling buttons is by far the worse minigame, 100% rng 0% skill. Hide and seek is just way to easy to win, doesnt matter which team you get.

comment,LetYaNutsHang12,Personal Tierlist including the new gamemodes (reasoning in comments),I feel like most of the game modes have a signifant RNG aspect but if you're skilled enough it becomes even easier to use them to your advantage and fuck with people. Race is S tier for sure just because I can get up top and block literally everyone and win on round one and the whole lobby will try to target you next game.

They basically make it so that there is no more space on 1 line of the chat, so the chat moves to the next line. And since the next line has no indication who wrote the message, they can make it say ""Player2: text text""

comment,MajicBannannas,"How to fix ""joining forever on server""?","I had to go into the files settings and change the debug value from 0 to 1. 

Close Crab Game (If it is open)

Open Steam

Find Crab Game in your Steam library 

Right click Crab Game on the left side if the screen 

Hover your mouse over ""manage"", then click ""browse local files"" 

Double click ""Crab Game_Data"" 

The configuration file you want will be called ""boot"" or ""boot.config"". Double click that.

Note: editing this file in ""notepad"" works just fine

Look for ""wait-for-native-debugger=0"". Simply delete the 0 and input a 1. 

Save the file, and close it. 

Open Crab game and enjoy 😇 

Note: When you launch crab game, you will get a notification telling you that you can turn on a debugger or something. This is normal and the game will still run fine

Tips: Don't join lobbies that allow more than 40 people, these are modded lobbies and I rarely get them to work. If you are trying to join a lobby that has 25+ people in it already, and it is still taking a long time, its probably because the lobby is full now, so try a new lobby with less people. I typically shoot for 15-20/40. Don't be discouraged by the blatant racism/sexism/homophobia, its literally just edge-lords who think they are funny, rather than actually being racists/sexists/homophobes.",2021-11-15 20:07:59,3,

1. ""CHILL CHILL CHILL""

2. ""DOOR GANG""

3. ""MUCK GREEEEEEN"" 

4. ""DONT PUSHHHH""

5. ""OOO OOO AAH AAH AAH""

6. *Hacker flying in every game*

7. *Hacker sends everyone out of map*

8. *Host dies and closes server*

9. *Try hards bunny hopping everywhere*

10. *Getting slapped by someone every second*

11. *Everyone can yeet you out of the map with one push, but you can barely move someone*

12. *Half the server climbing the left side wall of the lobby door*

Despite everything, I'm really having fun. It's so chaotic. One moment everyone's killing each other, the next moment those same people are teaming up and everyone is friendly.

submission,NinjaDoge250,Hide and Seek Change Suggestions,"I have two possible suggestions for the Hide and Seek game which is a little bit too rng and unfair to players who don't spawn in with the knife

OPTION 1
**•Let everyone spawn in with a knife•**
-This will give everyone an equal chance and allow for there to be an actual PVP game
-You still lose the knife after killing so you have to be strategic on when to kill which makes it riskier as some players will decide to only kill near the end of the game and risk being killed by the timer.

OPTION 2
**•Shorten the Timer•**
-From what I've seen and experienced, Even ""Hiders"" who play absolutely insane, get to dodge the Hunter but die with like 5-10 seconds remaining. I dont think I'd ever seen anyone actually manage to run away from the hunter, only those who got lucky enough to not get targetted, and it feels kinda unfair. So I suggest lowering the time and maybe even some map changes that would benefit the runner.

Honestly, you might as well not even call it Hide and Seek because rarely do people *actually* hide, most of them just run and juke. So you could either change the name or make this one a separate game.",2021-11-08 15:18:03,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/crabgame/comments/qpfr09/hide_and_seek_change_suggestions/

I'm not sure why you want to stall or what the culture is like from where you're posting from. I'm from Aus and these sort of deadlines are common here and if you have the contract, some of them stipulate a 2 week period where upon the day you start,you can leave for whatever reason. So what some people here do is sign the contract for a position they get, and if better one comes along sign to that one as well and then invoke the aforementioned clause at the appropriate time.

It seriously makes the experience of playing this game with americans so fucking unpleasant so sometimes we end up playing in brazilian servers even though my friends can't communicate with people.

It also, as a sidenote, makes this game impossible to livestream

EDIT: I think what it is is that the racist people make it so uncomfortable for the normal people that all that's left are racists.

comment,Beyopol,Fall Damage,"Interestingly, from my experiments, you dont necessarily need to be on a slope, or even sliding interestingly. In maps like blue line (with high towers) if you simply hug the wall (when i say wall i mean the wall on the edge of the map) you are able to negate fall damage in some places, this doesent only apply to the edge of the map however, it also applies to some of the structures in blue line (where i did most of my testing) where if you simply hug the wall while falling from a large height you have to chance to negate all fall damage. I have looked far and wide on the internet and have only found 1 recorded example of this happening [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyXL1hKghz8). They call it a jumpbug but that is something that is not related to what is happening. interestingly even though most of the time when hugging the edge of the map you wont take fall damage, there still are some spots like in one of the corners of blueline in which there is a large tower and in the very corner a small elevated block with grass on top of it which for some reason doesent let you negate fall damage. Btw quick note: In the starting lobby for grab games you can do the same thing where if you go to the very top of one of those bunk bed arrangements and jump down while hugging the wall the entire time, you dont get the effect that you would otherwise get for falling down (the effect you get when taking damage) .I am yet to figure out the prerequisites required to fully negate damage but i do know that some places fulfil them.

Summary: You can sometimes negate fall damage by just hugging a wall while falling but i dont know why.

P.S. I know the above is alot to read but i hope someone finds it somewhat interesting to read",2021-11-21 16:14:42,1,

submission,I0N1X,A few thoughts about the game,"Crab game is actually pretty  unique and casual. But I do have a few thoughts for how it could be made better.   


First the community is so toxic it puts even rust to shame, which makes the experience pretty unfun, especially when you get hard aimed if you're not friends with the server owner.   


Secondly, there are way too many hacks in this game, like every time you load in to certain servers you just get god slapped off the map and that makes it really unfun and boring to play so maybe even the most basic form of anticheat would make the experience significantly more fun.",2021-11-05 12:38:08,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crabgame/comments/qna7av/a_few_thoughts_about_the_game/
