submission,Freehitting,My 9.170s sussy slopes speedrun was retimed to 10.200s for me being stupid,"I know I can't do anything about this and it's my fault, but I feel like complaining. The rule where landing on the winning platform guard rail not counting is stupid. When in an actual server hosted game, the game registers you on the guard rail as finishing. I recognize that it is my fault for not making myself aware of the rule however, I still hold my opinion.

And for the record, I don't mind criticism. I actually need it to improve. So at your merit, ""video too long"" is a valid complaint, but you were a dick about it so you got it back. There's a massive difference between constructive criticism and just being a dick.

I don't care about blowing up on YouTube, I have an actual job that wouldn't allow me the time to make videos full time anyway. I make them because it's fun, so you can't expect me to cater to your short attention span. Maybe I should have called it a montage, maybe I should have only posted just the clip. Who cares. I dont.

I have 16gb of ram which majority of players have. Several games later, we hit the 60 players mark and the first game my screen was completely frozen and I could only see and use chat. Chat was going haywire too and majority just quit. Even if a lot of players might sound cool, it's an extremely bad idea not just because of lag, you also run the risk of getting banned.

comment,LetYaNutsHang12,Is water jumping patched?,"You know the freeze tech yet? It's arguably more broken than water tech tbh. Just go into windowed mode (shortcut alt-enter) RIGHT CLICK on the title tab at the top of the crab game client, and you won't take knockback while you're right clicking. However when you click off from the top bar all the knockback  you would've received will apply all at once and you'll fly off in whichever direction. On stepping stones you can skip the while thing if you coordinate properly with a friend. I don't believe it's on YouTube yet.

Also if you do it while in the lobby while it transitions into a actual game you won't spawn in and you'll just die at the start.",2021-12-24 20:56:33,1,

comment,I_Zilo_I,My opinion: Crab game is incredibly toxic.,"In all honesty, it's REALLY TOXIC. 

The only way to have fun/play the game is to have and invite only server with alot of friends. even the friendliest servers have two or more TOXIC people in it. and there is ALOT of things in this game to come up with that.

1. Slurs and Comments
2. Gameplay
3. ""kys"" sayings
4. Hacking and other gameplay

First and almost important is the slurs, this one really isn't a problem for me but for ALLLLLOOOOT of people. There is waaay too many people saying racial slurs like ""Ni\*\*er"" or ""Fa\*\*ot"". but it's almost only aimed towards people of color.

Second is the main gameplay. the game modes are REALLY enjoyable sometimes, but too many glitches and bugs happen in the gameplay. Like being flung out of the map or trying to push someone and they don't budge. And the sad thing about this is that people will accuse you of hacking when a simple game breaking glitch happens {which has happened to me multiple times}.

Now for the ""kill yourself"" sayings. This has happened to me and others on this game alot of times. And it always starts with a random no braincell argument that happens and the person who gets it said to doesn't even deserve it. I was having fun in a sever with almost no toxic energy going on, it was all fun and cheerful and we were just trying to get crates. Then out of nowhere two kids start mocking me and calling me a FAG and dumbass for no reason and multiple people seem to hate it Aswell and then leave. But before i leave they send me ""kys"". 

Now this one is kind of important but not really. people hack ALOT in this game and the more I have been playing this game the more I realize how EASY it is to hack on this game. You can quite literally look up how to mod/hack in this game and it'll show up a 1 MINUTE VIDEO.

And it's kind of sad to that you can't really enjoy the game without getting hated on. And the reason most people don't mute people is because it kind of ruins the interactions with the game as you will, people could quite literally be talking shit about you because of a minor thing you did without you knowing. And it's really sad how the only way you can enjoy this game is too mute and play only with friends. 

&#x200B;

This is only for the people who don't like getting randomly getting harassed on a video game and for the people who agree with the main opinion.",2021-12-29 06:36:26,1,

comment,electra_minx,what's up with all the racism?,"The whole point of saying those words is to get some kind of reaction, to hurt you. These people are not happy people, take their hate speech as a sign that you are doing mentally a lot better than them and its sad they have to provoke strangers online to feel satisfied with themselves ew",2021-11-08 03:33:02,4,
comment,lil_wage,what's up with all the racism?,"yeah absolutely. I think if they just knew that most people's reaction to it is not even getting pearl-clutchingly offended - which is what they seek - but often just a mix of aversion, boredom and second-hand embarrassment they would rethink this attitude",2021-11-08 08:02:13,2,
comment,lil_wage,what's up with all the racism?,"I'm brazilian and play on american servers sometimes with friends the amount of racism is night and fucking day. american servers got people who just have soundboards shouting the N word over and over and over again (or even saying it themselves) whereas brazilian servers got people with soundboards running actually funny sound clips, if obnoxious at times.

It seriously makes the experience of playing this game with americans so fucking unpleasant so sometimes we end up playing in brazilian servers even though my friends can't communicate with people.

It also, as a sidenote, makes this game impossible to livestream

EDIT: I think what it is is that the racist people make it so uncomfortable for the normal people that all that's left are racists. Because if you're a normal person just playing with friends for the funny games it gets real awkward to try and ignore the dude yelling racist shit and running around, so normal people just end up quitting the game for something a tad bit more civilized.",2021-11-07 05:35:26,6,
