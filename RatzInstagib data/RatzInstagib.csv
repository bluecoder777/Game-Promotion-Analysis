I saw somewhere that there is a theoretical maximum of like 100 players with the newly added ability to host your own servers, but there isn't a clear guide on how to setup a server + whether this is actually possible.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

EDIT- Above is what I was attempting to do. It turns out you can type in -resetres in the startup command line and it fixes the issue. Hope this helps. ",2017-02-18 08:02:04,1,

comment,PadawanBraid,Ratz Instagib Wishlist,"A little late to the subreddit, I just got the game on the Holiday Sale and love it. Here are my thoughts:

* Open items and maps to Steam Workshop (would hopefully flood the game with new content)
* ^ If not flooded with content, Ratz themselves add a shit ton more items
* Shoes/Leg items
* More slots for accessories 
* Better descriptions of beam types, frag types (in most cases just a description in the first place)
* Weapon Skins
* Rainbow beam
* Holiday beam effects (candy canes, four leaf clovers, bats, hearts, and so on)
* Boost effects/sounds (Flubber puddle and boing sound, Fart cloud and fart sound, Magician cloud and twinkle sound, and so on)
* Equippable taunts/celebrations for the top three players on the podium
* Title tags (500 kills may unlock a **Serial Killer** tag before your name, or Boosting 1,000 times may unlock a **Bunny Hopper** or **Rocket Jumper** tag before your name)
* Voice Chat!
* Gradients for names (not just single letter colors)
* Some destructible environments (holes in some walls, some cover that can be destroyed)

Not really an add-on to the game but Ratz.. Please advertise your game!! There aren't enough people playing to support even 6 game modes. And only got in because instead of $9 it was posted for $1.30 :(",2016-01-04 23:33:52,1,

* Progress bar on achievements
* Progress on unlockables
* Easier lobbies to play with friends
* FILL MATCHES!! Too many have 2 or 3 people and no one joins during the game
* Ranked playlist separate from social, and you play against similar skill levels
* Show population of players in a given playlist
* Describe what some option settings do (force fragtype 1 [ON-OFF]??)
* Have a legitimate website with tips, tricks, community, videos, updates, news, not just a redirect to steam. Doesn't make sense to have a link on the game, that goes to your website, that links to steam.
* Collaborate with other games to get new cameo items in Ratz and have Ratz items in other games
* Merchandise. Real world T-shirts, hats, mouse pads, key chains, wallpapers and so on
* Option to import your own music library. The soundtrack is good, it would just be cool to have my own music as well
* Unlockable characters/creatures
* Make it more obvious when you're about to unlock an item
* Option to call vote; change map, etc
* Change it so placing top three counts as a win in Deathmatch (I'm 0-14 only because I haven't placed 1st. But placed 2nd and 3rd many times)",2016-01-05 07:30:04,1,

Really the only annoying part is coming across really good players, BUT only when they're cocky. I played with a professional TF2 player and he wrecked shop, but he was really cool and even gave me some pointers. I don't mind good players, I always tell them they're really good and sing their praises.

F2P = Bad idea, cheaters would make the game die really fucking quick
Microtransactions = Bad idea, people get mad
I just think the best way to help grow the games player base is to do what you guys did these weekend every 2 weeks or so until the game has a solid amount of players [at least 50...?] playing at any given time.

What they should really be doing is having it free to play for the whole month of December or something, after working out a variety of the issues that were raised during this free weekend trial where they had a large number of players for the first time. Repeat that process to get more feedback and iterate on it, and then just go for it.

submission,herpesfairy,Kudos on getting more players in the game,"WOW.  I checked steamcharts.com today to see if anyone was playing the game and low and behold, I saw ~700 players.  That's ridiculous.  I'm pretty psyched to see that many people playing the game.  Of course it's temporary since it's a free weekend, but it's pretty awesome to finally play some 8player DMs and finally having the ability to try out something other than DM.

I was also happy to see multiple lobbies and even some people streaming the game.  I sure hope that it can stay this way.  One tiny annoyance: There are 2 steam users on this computer that use the same windows user and the settings are shared between the 2 steam accounts.  It's a bit of a bitch to go in and change the settings for the 2 different player back and forth.  It would be really nice to tie the settings to the steam user.

Another complain that I'm also seeing a lot as that players want to spectate in 1st person.  It's a great way to weed out cheaters and it's nice to see how others play the game from that perspective.",2015-09-11 10:00:21,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/3kiw21/kudos_on_getting_more_players_in_the_game/
submission,Decency,30 minute review!,"I'm a former extremely high level scoutzknivez player and have played a ton of Quake instagib, so I consider myself pretty well versed in the genre.

- My standard mouse settings are overridden by whatever raw input you're forcing (didn't see an off switch). I use default windows sensitivity and mouse acceleration and have no idea what values that corresponds to in your game. This alone made me stop playing, since it's going to fuck over my Counter-Strike aim pretty hard if I keep playing and I don't want to spend hours tweaking it.
- The menus take WAY too long to transition. Escape doesn't exit it.
- Is there a need for Boost and Shoot to be separate? The quake mod I played combined them to no ill-effect, and was a nice trade off that prevented people from blasting around corners with a shot primed and huge advantage.
- The rate of fire seems way too high, as people can get multiple shots before you can properly react. The Scout has a 1.25 second cooldown, Quake 3's railgun has a 1.5 second cooldown, and Quake4's is 1.6 seconds. I don't know what you're using, it feels like 0.75 or so. This MIGHT be okay if I'm using my standard settings and have full confidence in my 180's, but I doubt it. This feels like a change just to make DM better.

Seems fun, but I can't say I'd buy based on that experience. Yeah, I'd probably get my settings pretty close after a while, but that's a gigantic pain in the ass. Figured I'd leave my comments since you guys are kind enough to offer it for free this weekend. I'll probably give it a try again with a bunch of friends at some point in the next few days and can forward their comments as well.",2015-09-11 00:35:41,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/3khaq1/30_minute_review/

comment,Decency,30 minute review!,"That's an interesting ability, but you can't really call it an 'advantage' since obviously all players can do that. I'm more concerned with whether it makes duels more skill-intensive and fun. My initial thought is that getting hit by someone who can boost out from behind cover from a ton of different positions and fire well before you can react is probably not fun or interesting, but I'm willing to be convinced.",2015-09-11 11:07:13,1,

comment,herpesfairy,30 minute review!,"If you play these games at a high level, I'm not sure why you would use the default windows sensitivity.  That seems crazy to me.  No-one wants mouse acceleration for instance.

I agree the menus do take too long, but it's really not the biggest issue.

Boost & Shoot weren't separate in Quake, but it also couldn't account for your hit rate accurately.  I personally like the difference here.  It does create interesting plays.

The rate is roughly the same as RIU which I played competitively for quite some time in Q3.  The core difference is that the cooldown would be less if you hit something or if you used to rail to bounce off a wall.  That certainly limited the *spam* but it really shouldn't be that much of an issue.  This is certainly the type of game where you'll awnt to do 180s hit shots on the fly at a high level.  I don't really see much of an issue with the high rate.  In fact it's interesting if you're really good since you can kill a lot of people quickly.",2015-09-11 09:51:19,1,
comment,Decency,30 minute review!,"> If you play these games at a high level, I'm not sure why you would use the default windows sensitivity. That seems crazy to me.

Virtually everyone who is competent in competitive gaming uses a 6/11 sensitivity in Windows to avoid mouse scaling. Liquipedia: [If the mouse pointer speed is set higher or lower than 6, Windows will artificially modify the mouse input](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Mouse_settings#Optimal_Windows_Setting). Using anything else causes the values to be rounded and be inconsistent. Most games simply allow you to use your existing mouse settings by default, rather than overriding them and forcing configuration.

> No-one wants mouse acceleration for instance.

While it's true that this is not common in most games, a large number of competitive Quake players and some Counter-Strike pros use mouse acceleration because it aids in quick movement/airstrafing/bunnyhopping significantly while still allowing you to use very small sensitivities for aiming. Saying that no one wants this is frankly just wrong.

> Boost & Shoot weren't separate in Quake, but it also couldn't account for your hit rate accurately. I personally like the difference here. It does create interesting plays.

The accuracy thing can be avoided very trivially: if a shot causes your movement to change because it hit a wall, just don't count that shot. I haven't played enough to judge whether it makes the game better, but I doubt it because it gives a player peeking from cover at speed an enormous advantage which is definitely counter to most FPS games, even Quake.

I don't know what RIU is, but the hit rate seems far too fast to me for anything other than a Deathmatch mode and would actually detract a ton from team based games. I don't want to play a duel where someone can fire twice before I can even find him and flick shot, which seems like it's the case currently.",2015-09-11 10:51:13,2,

Hello Ratz fans! 

It's been a while since the last update to Ratz Instagib but today, I'm happy to tell you about a whole heap of updates to the game that I hope you're going to love! 

First, the big news… 

**Announcing the Ratz Map Editor!**

> Yes, it's finally in the making! The Ratz Map Editor will allow you to create your own game maps and play/share them with the community. Thankfully, the development of it doesn't seem as complicated as I first thought, 


> **but it's still too early to give exact details on when it'll be finished.** Nevertheless, my goal is to provide simple tools to allow everyone to create nice maps, but at the same time give advanced users the full customisation options they need. 
> 
> Check out these early screenshots:

>  [[Map 2]](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/9/Map2.jpg)
> 

**New Customisation Items!**

> I've created [17](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/9/Cosmetics.jpg) (!) new items, including one special item for everyone who supports Ratz while it's in Early Access – the Improved Jetpack! 
> This item won't be unlockable once the game leaves Early Access next year, so be sure to grab it while you can! 
>

>  [[Jetpack]](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/9/StorepageJetpack.jpg) 



***And on top of this new content, I've made lots of improvements to the game too***

**Tweaked Player movement –**

> Lower Jump height and increased Gravity

**Bigger Player Hitbox –** 
>Adjusted the Hitbox size of players to balance it with the player outline/equipped items 

**Precise mouse sensitivity –** 
>This should give more room for exact mouse speed settings

**Zoom multiplier –** 
>Set how much the zoom should affect the mouse sensitivity 
Improved 

**AFK-System –**

>It's now less aggressive and has some bugs fixed

**Pixel Beam looks improved**

***
Hello! 

Let's get straight on with today's update information, since I know you've all been waiting for it... 

***Network Update!***

>Yes, it's finally done! I've worked hard to improve the network code of Ratz, since it's been the top comment people have had about the game since it arrived in Early Access. 

>If you score a hit on someone, they will die at least 50% faster – especially if you have to play with high ping. It's also much more consistent, which should make the game much, much better to play! 

>So, if you are one of those people who were getting a ping of 150+, you should give Ratz another try! 

>*Please keep in mind that I had to rewrite some pretty sensitive code to get this updated networking going – as such, if you come across any bugs or issues, please let me know straight away.*

I prepared some gifs for you (they should run at 30fps, i hope they don't slow down): 

> [30 Ping](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/8/30Ping.gif)
> 
> [130 Ping](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/8/30Ping.gif)
> 
> [330 Ping](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/8/340Ping.gif)
> 


[**Zoom**](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/8/Zoom.gif)

>I've also now added a feature that, to be honest, should have been already in Ratz from the start: you can set a separate Zoom FOV to your own liking with the option of toggling it on or off. 
I hope that helps some of you! 



[**Even More Customisation!**](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/8/NewItems_small.jpg)
>Some truly explosive new cosmetics are ready for you to unlock! 



**Anti-Idle/AFK System Enhancements**
>Ever since the Customisation side of Ratz was launched, I've had a lot of complaints from players about people going AFK and idling in the hope of unlocking items without actually having to play. 
On top of the system that was there before, I've now improved the Anti-Idle System to weed out these AFK players – hopefully, this new update should solve the problem. 
Remember, folks: idling doesn't unlock customisation items, it just annoys everyone around you! 



**Additional Fixes**
> 
> - Assigning Mouse Buttons 4/5, Shift and Alt in the Options menu works as it should now. 
> 
> - Item Unlock will no longer unlock the wrong item. ",2015-06-02 22:02:23,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/38a7hz/ratz_update_207_the_longawaited_network_update/

**[Will you find a Golden Ticket?](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/7/GoldenTicket_.jpg)**

So, today's a special day for Ratz Instagib...

To celebrate the massive addition of customisation options, we're running a promotion over this weekend with some prizes to give away! Plus, big discounts on buying the game!   


First up, the competition. As you'll know by now, playing the game in most modes gives you the chance to earn special customisation items for your rat. This weekend though (and until the winners appear!), we've added a very special item: a Golden Ticket that, if found, can win you a prize! 

The rules are simple: play the game as normal and keep your eyes open for a Golden Ticket drop in your inventory. If you get one, add the developer on Steam (Lizzard4000) and trade him the ticket item as quick as you can... if you're one of the first two people to do this, you'll win a signed Mad Catz R.A.T. gaming mouse worth £60! 

Please note: only the first two people to trade their ticket to Lino will win. There are more than two tickets in the system, but the item will be removed once we have our winners. 

**Ratz on sale!**

On top of this exciting promotion, we're offering Ratz Instagib this weekend only (22-26 May) for 33% off! This discount applies to both individual and 4-pack key purchases so, if you want to introduce a friend to Ratz, now's your chance to do it for less. 

***Have fun everyone and good luck finding those tickets... we'll see you on the rat-tlefield!***

A big update for Ratz today, with some things that a lot of you have been asking for. 

The biggest new feature is the **arrival of bots** to play against. The implementation caused me some nightmares, but they are finally done and I think they’re pretty good! Host a private match (Deathmatch only at the moment), add up to eight bots, set the difficulty and test your skills against them. And if you’re familiar with the best Ratz players out there… well, you might recognize some of them!

Next, a new map: **[the Classroom.](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/3/Map_Class_Small.jpg)** It features a lot of obstacles to use as cover, and I can't wait to test this unique layout with you all! 


Tired of playing Deathmatch all the time? Then hit ESC and click the **‘Vote Gametype’** button. After the vote has passed, the next match will switch to your desired gametype.

Also, there’s now an **[‘Open Room’ notification](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/3/OpenRoom.jpg)** next to the Gametype selection. This will let you know where to find a game, so you’ll never miss out! 
 

On top of all these pretty massive improvements, there are also some minor fixes such as: 

• **Separate Mouse Speed X/Y** 
Set individual speed for you mouse X/Y axis in the options menu! 

• **Hit Outlines** 
Opponents’ outlines flash white if hit, makes it more obvious that they are about to explode (this feature was disabled by mistake in the last patch, but it works again now). 

• **Respawning** 
You can now also respawn with the ‘Jump’ key (default: Space Bar). That way, you won't accidentally fire a shot upon spawning and revealing your position to the opposition! 

Please be aware that there might be some bugs (especially with the bot implementation) so if you find anything weird, please tell me!

submission,herpesfairy,Finding Players,"perhaps the biggest problem at this point for the game is simply being able to play it at all.  I'm having a really hard time finding players in general.  Yesterday we had a great game and I was able to stream it all on twitch and everyone was having fun and courteous.  Today; I'm queueing on every server with every game type (although it's typically always DM) and I can't find a single player.

Right now what I'd REALLY like is something along these lines:

For each server; the total number of players that are on it (ie: someone who has chosen a given; is online and may or not be playing right now)
For each gametype on a given server; I'd love to see how many players there are so I can know where to go and play.

I've been queue'ed up for over 30m in the most likely bin (EU/DM at this time of day).  It's not cool :/.  It would be nice to have some incentive for players to jump on a server and just screw around.  ie: I wouldn't mind practicing jumps in a map while waiting for a player.  Right now we're somewhat in a deadlock because a player tries to find a game; gives up after a short while.  Another player comes around; tries it; finds nothing gives up etc..

So, the Ratz-Server software is included in this update! Using it, you can create your own private server on one PC that holds up to 100 players… perfect for LAN parties! 
You find the files and instructions on how to use it in the installation folder of Ratz Instagib.   

Also in this update, I added the other two prototype maps. I think they still hold up quality-wise… enjoy them!   [Map 1](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/2/Blue.jpg) and [Map 2](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/2/Cyro.jpg).

  
* Spectator Mode

Now, you can spectate on matches as well as play them! Hit ESC at the start of a match before spawning and press the Spectate button. 
Please note, only two people can spectate on a match at a time right now, and you can only switch to Spectator Mode before a match begins. 

 

But wait… there’s more interesting stuff in this update too! 

* Custom Crosshairs 
Look for the ""CustomCrosshairs"" folder in your Ratz installation folder. The game will read all "".png"" files in there and put them into the Options menu to choose! 

* Crosshair Colours 
Change the colour of your crosshair to anything you like! 

* Spawn sounds 
Other players now spawn with a sound effect, so you don't get surprised if someone spawns right behind you. 

* Tweak: Reduced the amount of wins you need to unlock the Freeze-Fragtype to 50.
* [Access other players’ Steam Profile after the match](http://www.ratzinstagib.com/_data/Steam/2/profile.jpg)

I'm ~level 200 playing against a level 1300 in DM.  The game ends at 30/29 in his favor; I end up losing a bunch of pts.  It seems a little silly that someone who's ranked low and does really well against a high ranked player gets penalized so much.  Conversely; winning doesn't give many points.  It looks to me like the system should be more aggressive at up-ranking players that play well against high ranked players.  Similarly the higher level player should be dinged harder for performing pooly vs a low ranked player imo.

Otherwise; it looks to me like the ranking system is more about how many games you have played than about a true reflection of skill (provided that you do better than average).",2015-01-30 09:49:28,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/2u6mi7/ranking/

submission,k0nichi,My thoughts about this game.,"First of all, let me customize my netsettings. i have decent ping (30-40ms) but it seems like some shots just dont get registered. Either let me coustomize my netsettings or make the hitboxes more accurate.

2. id like to see a faster movement speed, not ""bhop"" acual walking speed. srsly i cannt stand the fact that you have to jump everywhere inorder to stay alive.

3. i know the developer already mentioned that new maps are comming but ill mention it anyway. maybe a map that requires a new playstyle for ratz. i thought about a map with multiple layers some sort of floating platforms, a map where you can 1v1 some1 for 3secs without being killed from the back after you fragged them.

this is not some sort of ""this game sucks"" post, i just wanted to point out the things that bug about the game atm. its an awesome game and the skill cap is pretty high as of right now since not alot of people play this game right now and the ones that are online are either alpha/beta testers or they come from a quake like shooter and have decent aim. and its especially frustrating when the shots dont seem to register.",2015-01-27 12:37:42,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/2tu2a1/my_thoughts_about_this_game/
comment,SlowlyHomoeroticism,My thoughts about this game.,"The bhop in this is so stupidly easy. You don't have to be frame perfect or anything you just have to jump a lot. It also makes you harder to hit, naturally, because you're moving vertically and horizontally. The game also has insane aerial control so you can be hopping around and just change direction midair, or blast yourself in the other direction.

So what you're suggesting would be a downgrade to how you move around, and it would take away the ability to move slowly to line up shots or play mind games with your momentum.

I don't say this basically ever, but get gud. Learn to press space a bunch, because just running faster would make you easier to hit than the hopping, and would kind of foster a mindset of ignoring all the movement in the game, which is so plentiful and easy it's just a massive waste to ignore.",2015-01-28 04:33:55,5,
comment,k0nichi,My thoughts about this game.,The movement atm seems pretty random you cannt  really outmove your opponent. The only way to dodge shots is jumping left and right and maybe stop midair. I'd like to see some sort of strafe feature where you can stutter step,2015-01-28 06:10:03,-2,
comment,SlowlyHomoeroticism,My thoughts about this game.,"The movement is the opposite of random.

If you can't outmove your opponent, that would be because they are better at the movement system than you are.

In which case, the answer isn't ""change the movement"" it's ""i should get better at the movement.""

Learn to use the puff-jump, learn to air strafe, learn to stutter your momentum in the air, learn to be able to gain speed and keep it while having a good idea of your surroundings.

The game has these movement tools that are done very well, and unlike other games with serious movement options, Ratz has almost no real complex actions. The puff-jumping is basically rocket jumping, but you don't hurt yourself and you don't need to jump or crouch. The hopping is basically bunny hopping, but you don't need to be frame perfect. The air strafing doesn't require only strafing, you can completely change your momentum in the air in any direction at any time like a megaman game.

Figure out the tools of the game before you say something is broken or random.",2015-01-28 06:43:24,3,
comment,herpesfairy,My thoughts about this game.,Yah; I'm a fan of the game; but I do think that there's a couple of annoying camping spots which I'm just starting to learn.  I think a lot of the issue are based on the fact that the map design is such that every map is super wide open.  I'd really like to see some maps with a ton of small nooks and cranny (think more like quake 3).  I'm thinking that this would really create some more interesting play.,2015-01-30 09:38:10,2,

submission,SlowlyHomoeroticism,Custom music?,"first off: holy shit. this might be my favorite FPS ever. easy movement options, high learning curve with low starting requirements, simple objectives in a very intense but somewhat casual environment, it's everything i love in games in general.

the biggest kicker though, like what made me really know i was in for a good time, was going into the options and seeing customization fucking everywhere. there's so much ability to change the visuals in ways other games don't even TRY for. you can change the colors of the individual colors in your fuckin' NAME it's just really fantastic and awesome.

so i guess the question is, is custom music going to be implemented at all? the default tracks are amazing, but there's like, this whole music player in the corner there telling me what track is playing, and where in the song you are, and even a button to skip ahead to the next song. it seems just BEGGING for the ability to import your own songs, and it'd fit with what seems to be a theme of extreme customization of the personal experience.

also while i'm here in this post; why did you put it down as early access? it seems basically finished. adding new maps and gameplay modes and such isn't really something you need to do while in early access? patching things into a new game isn't unheard of, and if you hype it up correctly, it can actually work really well for you. see TF2, a game that every now and then just kind of updates with some new hats and everyone goes nuts and remembers it exists and plays it more.

from like, a consumer perspective, early access games have become like a super serious gamble. the title of ""early access"" implies an inherently broken experience that requires an investment of capital and patience to ultimately pay off, and recently that investment has been a bust for a lot of people.

It kind of carries a stigma now, and it's a harsh one. it seems to make more economical sense to me to release your honestly finished game as a full release, and then add onto it over time. people love games that constantly update with new maps and new gamemodes and shit like that. they eat it up.

but with early access is on there it makes people wary of those updates. will this update break the game? will they make a big update and never release it? will this damn thing even be finished?

all that kind of shit isn't even applicable to this great game you've made, but it's something people who are making the decision to buy have to consider.

anyways that's way too long a post.

good game, i want to play rules of nature in the background, and early access games are usually dumb but this isn't dumb you did good.",2015-01-26 18:04:46,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/2tqqvd/custom_music/

submission,dosukooi,My opinion on the game right now.,"Gameplay wise it's a lot of fun, I've been playing a few games as a work pause here and there, and the interface, and find game features really fits this kind of game. I really mean it, gameplay wise it's awesome.

But this kind of game, with this kind of price (8€) takes a toll on the playerbase. I don't really know much about marketing pricing and whatnot, but 8€ is pricey for an arena instagib shooter. The fact that it says early access on Steam might drive away some players, and at the current stage of development I think it can be dimmed as beta stage. Or even complete, and do a roll-out development, delivering constant updates.

And again, don't take me wrong on this one too, because I know nothing about it, and I know it's kinda hard to get the game shown to the audience, but I really think there should be more effort on the marketing of this product. Handing out keys like mad, is not that good of a policy as it reduces hype greatly. It should be more confined as of right now(if it really is early access). It's difficult to be coherent on planning this kind of stuff. Today's games really build up a lot of hype, and most of them can't live up to it, but that's how you make some money!

I really think there should be a more of an effort on advertising this. 

Then again, just my 2 cents bro.

EDIT:

Forgot to say that something like rockets or shafts, kind of an airshot game would be fun as well, adding other features to the game, but I don't know if that deviates too much from the original pov of the game.",2015-01-25 17:07:44,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/2tmkqv/my_opinion_on_the_game_right_now/

I can't tell if the items are what attracted people here or the cheap price is what got new people added to the mix, but I'd love to hear what's planned next to help for this.

For what it's worth, the community players here may have some great ideas to help boost the player base.  I read you mentioned that it would hard to have a map editor, but I'd personally love to see the old quake maps converted over to this game.  We probably can't legally convert the baseq3 ones, but there's a lot of really great ones that the community made which would be awesome to play on.

If so, I would fear that this would leave an impression with former players or people currently interesting in trying it out (I wasn't aware of the existence of the prototype until I found the the v2.0 on steam) that you are effectively committing extortion by withholding what used to be a free product.

I'm also developing a fast-paced FPS where netcode smoothness is very important. What does Ratz Instagib use for networking (in particular, to sync player position)? Does it use the built in smoothsyncmovement of Photon Network? Is it simply sending position and rotation and interpolating them?

EDIT:
Also, since this is a zeroping approach, I guess it means that if a lagger enters your game, he is going to have some kind of advantage, as he will see the other players move much later than everyone else and maybe shoot them when on their side they've already taken cover. How do you deal with this? Do you just kick high ping players?",2014-05-29 15:27:13,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/26sjoo/question_about_the_netcode/

Yes its just interpolating between positions.

Teambased gametype i know from Quake.
Instead of killing a hit opponent you freeze them.
Frozen enemys are not able to move, but can be unfrozen by close  (1-2meters) teammates.
That should add more tactic to the game.

Just like real football, there is a ball that can be shot and needs to get moved into the enemys goal. Depending where u hit it, the ball will be thrown into a direction.

Look it up at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system. Obviously it is used for duels. Duels with Elo rating system means matches with players of similar skill level and something worth competing for (competing to increase your own and to decrease your opponent's Elo rating (sounds fun, huh?)). You simply throw 2 players of similar Elo (similar Elo means similar skill level) and we will see who is the best at this game. Check the link to see how the Elo rating is calculated and you will understand why THIS IDEA IS FUCKIN' BRILLIANT. In my opinion 10 frags is enough, but it's for you to decide. Add warm up period as in Quake Live and the players are good to go. As you see, fighting for your Elo rating means COMPETITIVENESS, competitiveness means A LOT OF PLAYERS, a lot of players means more likely to find an EQUALLY SKILLED OPPONENT ANY TIME OF THE DAY BOTH FOR A NOOB AND A PRO. Innovate for once, you can add all these dogmatic game modes later. INNOVATION is the one that sells! What do I want for this? I want a game, where I can always find a similarly skilled opponent any time of the day and by playing against similarly skilled opponents improve my skills and have fun 24/7, FOR ALL OF US GAMERS OUT THERE!!!

Maybe it's possible to calculate team based gamemode Elo when playing with random team members, I bet it's possible.


I have an idea for a brilliant gamemode too. It's a 1 FLAG CTF, but you need to CARRY FLAG TO ENEMY'S BASE to score. Why to enemy's base? Because it's more difficult this way. More difficult equals MORE INTERESTING GAMEMODE. Add respawn timer and you are good to go. Here you go, ANOTHER INNOVATION. GG WP? :)",2014-07-22 11:05:21,2,

>The __Elo rating system__ is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitor-versus-competitor games such as [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess). It is named after its creator [Arpad Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpad_Elo), a [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary)-born [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) professor.

>The Elo system was invented as an improved [chess rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_rating_system) and is also used in many other games. It is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game),  and has been adapted to team sports including [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer) ([association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football)), American college football, basketball, [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball), [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), and [esports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports).

>The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.

submission,Lizzard4000,Leaderboard? Stats?,"I will most probaply use steams leaderboard/stats system.
Stats will be associated with the Players Steam account.
This way no seperate loginsystem or leaderboard database is needed.
(In the old Ratz version, people often got their stats reset to zero. This was probaply the Leaderboard systems fault that i used.)

Do you guys have any experience with steams leaderboards in other games?",2014-03-19 19:57:34,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/20u8n3/leaderboard_stats/

I completely rewrote the movement system. Much better performance and no glitching through walls.

I also added a way to get increased movement speed by railboosting off of walls. If you thouch a wall for too long or stand still you loose that speed.
4-5 railboosts to get a 50% speed increase.

What do you think?",2014-03-18 21:04:16,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatzInstagib/comments/20r1ly/ratz_20_devlog_movement_01/

If you look close on the top left you see ""Player Speed"".
At 0.35-0.42 you see me bunnyhopping without railboost.
The Player Speed wont go over 10.
Then after i did some railboosts i can move around at a constant 14.",2014-03-21 13:15:58,1,
comment,rhubarb_9,Ratz 2.0 Devlog | Movement 01,Definitely need that. 50% looks like too much though. CTF could get lame going that fast.,2014-03-21 23:55:27,1,
comment,themcs,Ratz 2.0 Devlog | Movement 01,"If I'm understanding right, it's basically just applying a set speed boost for every rail jump you do? 

Rail jumps in the past have always worked the same as rockets, which boost you in the opposite direction of the explosion, and more boost the closer you are to the center. I think that is a better, deeper mechanic than just applying an arbitrary speed boost.",2014-04-16 20:55:23,1,
