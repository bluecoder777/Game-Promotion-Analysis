I use default windows sensitivity and mouse acceleration and have no idea what values that corresponds to in your game. This alone made me stop playing, since it's going to fuck over my Counter-Strike aim pretty hard if I keep playing and I don't want to spend hours tweaking it.\n- The menus take WAY too long to transition. Escape doesn't exit it.\n- Is there a need for Boost and Shoot to be separate? The quake mod I played combined them to no ill-effect, and was a nice trade off that prevented people from blasting around corners with a shot primed and huge advantage.\n- The rate of fire seems way too high, as people can get multiple shots before you can properly react. The Scout has a 1.25 second cooldown, Quake 3's railgun has a 1.5 second cooldown, and Quake4's is 1.6 seconds. I don't know what you're using, it feels like 0.75 or so. This MIGHT be okay if I'm using my standard settings and have full confidence in my 180's, but I doubt it. This feels like a change just to make DM better.\n\nSeems fun, but I can't say I'd buy based on that experience. Yeah, I'd probably get my settings pretty close after a while, but that's a gigantic pain in the ass. Figured I'd leave my comments since you guys are kind enough to offer it for free this weekend. I'll probably give it a try again with a bunch of friends at some point in the next few days and can forward their comments as well.",

The core difference is that the cooldown would be less if you hit something or if you used to rail to bounce off a wall.  That certainly limited the *spam* but it really shouldn't be that much of an issue.  This is certainly the type of game where you'll awnt to do 180s hit shots on the fly at a high level.  I don't really see much of an issue with the high rate.  In fact it's interesting if you're really good since you can kill a lot of people quickly.",

            "body": "> If you play these games at a high level, I'm not sure why you would use the default windows sensitivity. That seems crazy to me.\n\nVirtually everyone who is competent in competitive gaming uses a 6/11 sensitivity in Windows to avoid mouse scaling. Liquipedia: [If the mouse pointer speed is set higher or lower than 6, Windows will artificially modify the mouse input]( Using anything else causes the values to be rounded and be inconsistent. Most games simply allow you to use your existing mouse settings by default, rather than overriding them and forcing configuration.\n\n> No-one wants mouse acceleration for instance.\n\nWhile it's true that this is not common in most games, a large number of competitive Quake players and some Counter-Strike pros use mouse acceleration because it aids in quick movement/airstrafing/bunnyhopping significantly while still allowing you to use very small sensitivities for aiming. Saying that no one wants this is frankly just wrong.\n\n> Boost & Shoot weren't separate in Quake, but it also couldn't account for your hit rate accurately. I personally like the difference here. It does create interesting plays.\n\nThe accuracy thing can be avoided very trivially: if a shot causes your movement to change because it hit a wall, just don't count that shot. I haven't played enough to judge whether it makes the game better, but I doubt it because it gives a player peeking from cover at speed an enormous advantage which is definitely counter to most FPS games, even Quake.\n\nI don't know what RIU is, but the hit rate seems far too fast to me for anything other than a Deathmatch mode and would actually detract a ton from team based games. I don't want to play a duel where someone can fire twice before I can even find him and flick shot, which seems like it's the case currently.",

Simple example of that:\n\n\nSince I've had a lot of requests about this, I made a video some while ago.  There's more than movement in there, but you can skip the parts you don't care about:\n\n\n\nNot too many people can move well in this game.  Most players tend to rely on their aim.",

Make sure you know how to use the \"rail jump\" effectively to get anywhere really quickly (there are plenty of videos on that).  The rest is really flick/aim practice.",

Today; I'm queueing on every server with every game type (although it's typically always DM) and I can't find a single player.\n\nRight now what I'd REALLY like is something along these lines:\n\nFor each server; the total number of players that are on it (ie: someone who has chosen a given; is online and may or not be playing right now)\nFor each gametype on a given server; I'd love to see how many players there are so I can know where to go and play.\n\nI've been queue'ed up for over 30m in the most likely bin (EU/DM at this time of day).  It's not cool :/.  It would be nice to have some incentive for players to jump on a server and just screw around.  ie: I wouldn't mind practicing jumps in a map while waiting for a player.  Right now we're somewhat in a deadlock because a player tries to find a game; gives up after a short while.  Another player comes around; tries it; finds nothing gives up etc..\n\nThoughts; Ideas?",

            "body": "first off: holy shit. this might be my favorite FPS ever. easy movement options, high learning curve with low starting requirements, simple objectives in a very intense but somewhat casual environment, it's everything i love in games in general.\n\nthe biggest kicker though, like what made me really know i was in for a good time, was going into the options and seeing customization fucking everywhere. there's so much ability to change the visuals in ways other games don't even TRY for. you can change the colors of the individual colors in your fuckin' NAME it's just really fantastic and awesome.\n\nso i guess the question is, is custom music going to be implemented at all? the default tracks are amazing, but there's like, this whole music player in the corner there telling me what track is playing, and where in the song you are, and even a button to skip ahead to the next song. it seems just BEGGING for the ability to import your own songs, and it'd fit with what seems to be a theme of extreme customization of the personal experience.\n\nalso while i'm here in this post; why did you put it down as early access? it seems basically finished. adding new maps and gameplay modes and such isn't really something you need to do while in early access? patching things into a new game isn't unheard of, and if you hype it up correctly, it can actually work really well for you. see TF2, a game that every now and then just kind of updates with some new hats and everyone goes nuts and remembers it exists and plays it more.\n\nfrom like, a consumer perspective, early access games have become like a super serious gamble. the title of \"early access\" implies an inherently broken experience that requires an investment of capital and patience to ultimately pay off, and recently that investment has been a bust for a lot of people.\n\nIt kind of carries a stigma now, and it's a harsh one. it seems to make more economical sense to me to release your honestly finished game as a full release, and then add onto it over time. people love games that constantly update with new maps and new gamemodes and shit like that. they eat it up.\n\nbut with early access is on there it makes people wary of those updates. will this update break the game? will they make a big update and never release it? will this damn thing even be finished?\n\nall that kind of shit isn't even applicable to this great game you've made, but it's something people who are making the decision to buy have to consider.\n\nanyways that's way too long a post.\n\ngood game, i want to play rules of nature in the background, and early access games are usually dumb but this isn't dumb you did good.",

            "body": "Gameplay wise it's a lot of fun, I've been playing a few games as a work pause here and there, and the interface, and find game features really fits this kind of game. I really mean it, gameplay wise it's awesome.\n\nBut this kind of game, with this kind of price (8) takes a toll on the playerbase. I don't really know much about marketing pricing and whatnot, but 8 is pricey for an arena instagib shooter. The fact that it says early access on Steam might drive away some players, and at the current stage of development I think it can be dimmed as beta stage. Or even complete, and do a roll-out development, delivering constant updates.\n\nAnd again, don't take me wrong on this one too, because I know nothing about it, and I know it's kinda hard to get the game shown to the audience, but I really think there should be more effort on the marketing of this product. Handing out keys like mad, is not that good of a policy as it reduces hype greatly. It should be more confined as of right now(if it really is early access). It's difficult to be coherent on planning this kind of stuff. Today's games really build up a lot of hype, and most of them can't live up to it, but that's how you make some money!\n\nI really think there should be a more of an effort on advertising this. \n\nThen again, just my 2 cents bro.\n\nEDIT:\n\nForgot to say that something like rockets or shafts, kind of an airshot game would be fun as well, adding other features to the game, but I don't know if that deviates too much from the original pov of the game.",

            "body": "Hey, as an old Quaker I am naturally drawn to this game, but I have a few questions.\n\n1. What engine is the game built on?\n2. Does the game have raw mouse input?\n - Can you specify the sensitivity with a numeric value and decimal points?\n3. What FPS lock options are there?\n - I notice in the video the FPS is locked to 120, is this due to vsync or is it a forced lock by the engine? Can you unlock the FPS? Can you specify an FPS lock yourself?",
