Biped,Very fun,0.0,Positive
Biped,"Biped is a charming and cooperative puzzle-platformer that delivers a fun and lighthearted experience. You control adorable robots, ""Aku"" and ""Sila,"" as they traverse a series of levels that require precision, teamwork, and creative problem-solving. The game‚Äôs standout mechanic is its unique movement system, where each leg is controlled individually, adding an extra layer of challenge and hilarity as you wobble around.

The puzzles are well-designed and progressively more difficult, encouraging communication and coordination, especially in co-op mode. Whether you‚Äôre balancing on narrow platforms or solving timing-based puzzles, every moment feels like a fun test of your teamwork skills.

Visually, the game‚Äôs colorful, minimalist aesthetic adds to its charm, and the lighthearted soundtrack complements the cheerful vibe. However, the game is relatively short, and while it‚Äôs perfect for a few hours of fun, some players might wish for more content.

Overall, Biped is a delightful co-op game that shines in its simplicity and creativity. It‚Äôs an ideal choice for those looking to enjoy some light puzzle-solving with a friend.",14.0,Positive

Biped,"This game is a whole lot of fun especially with someone who gets frustrated easily. The puzzles are fairly easy but making teamwork happen is the hard part. Highly recommend it!

Worms Rumble,"I got worms armegeddon and rumble, and I first played a lot of armegeddon. It was really fun and I was expecting this to be like that, a turned based 2D game. But that ended up being a huge slap in the face, and I only managed to even play in ONE server, and that was on quickplay. Just go back to making 2D games.",0.0,Negative
Worms Rumble,this game is dead. do NOT buy it.,0.0,Negative
Worms Rumble,"Nice concept, poor implementation.

Nice because I totally dig it. I've played all the Worms games, since like '98 or something. And when I played W.M.D., the previous game, I really felt that this concept of 2D turn-based combat is just getting too old. Maybe the old games deserve remaster, but new games definitely need to go somewhere further. And doing a Worms battle royale game sounds like a reasonable strategy.

But, apparently, it's just another blind attempt to catch the hype train. With dollar sign eyes.
The game doesn't have bots. At all.
All you can do it pick the game mode, click ""play"" and wait whle the game itself finds some tryharders to beat you. No custom matches with AI, no single-player campaign (in case someone played these in previous games lol), just a bare-bone clone of an average dumb game.

The last thing I noticed about the devs themselves: Deluxe edition includes pre-order bonus. So they introduced this bonus to motivate people pre-order their product, but then said to themselves ""screw these goofs"", and just added it to their pile of other DLCs just to squeeze out more money. Not unusual these days, but scam is still a scam.",2.0,Negative
Worms Rumble,"This is absolute trash. It doesn't have local, private or 1v1 game mode, so you'll never be able to play as it never finds other players.

Party Animals,"Very Fun Game especially if you can play with a group of friends. The controls can take some getting used to, but besides that, I've found that its very beginner friendly",0.0,Positive
Party Animals,"Cheaters are running rampant, ruining match after match with speed hacks, invulnerability and other exploits that destroy any sense of fair play. What‚Äôs the point of a competitive brawler if one single player can dominate the entire lobby with hacks? I‚Äôve reported so many, but the problem just keeps getting worse.

But here‚Äôs the kicker - rather than focusing on real anti-cheat measures, the devs decide to reintroduce macros that only help players automate and abuse the game mechanics. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre actively encouraging people to find new ways to exploit the game.

It‚Äôs beyond frustrating that the devs aren't taking the community's feedback seriously. Instead of banning cheaters and tightening security, they‚Äôre just adding features that make the situation even more chaotic. Hopefully one day I can change my review to a positive one.",0.0,Negative

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)

**Introduction:**
""Perfect Heist 2"" is a multiplayer heist game that emphasizes strategy, cooperation, and a bit of deception. Developed by the indie team at ""The Perfect Heist Team,"" it offers a unique twist on the classic heist formula, allowing players to either assume the role of thieves planning the perfect heist or the cops trying to thwart them. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at what makes ""Perfect Heist 2"" engaging, along with some areas for improvement.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- **Asymmetrical Gameplay:** The game features two distinct roles: thieves and police. Thieves must strategize and execute their heist while managing resources, while police must anticipate and counter their moves. This dynamic creates a tense and engaging experience.
- **Heist Planning and Execution:** Thieves have the freedom to plan their heists creatively, using various tools and gadgets to bypass security measures. This encourages players to think strategically and adapt to the unfolding situation.

---

**Visuals and Sound Design:**
- **Art Style:** The game features a stylized, minimalist aesthetic that keeps the focus on gameplay. The clean design and vibrant colors enhance the experience without overwhelming players.
- **Soundtrack:** The background music complements the gameplay, building tension during heist moments while remaining unobtrusive. Sound effects are effective, adding to the immersion during both planning and action phases.

---

**Multiplayer Experience:**
- **Cooperative Play:** The game thrives in its multiplayer setup, where teamwork is crucial for success. Communicating and coordinating with teammates adds depth to the gameplay, creating memorable moments.
- **Player Interaction:** The interactions between thieves and police can lead to humorous and unpredictable scenarios, making each match feel unique.

---

**Community and Content:**
- **Variety of Maps:** ""Perfect Heist 2"" features multiple maps with different layouts and challenges. Each map requires players to adapt their strategies, ensuring that gameplay remains fresh.
- **Regular Updates:** The developers have shown a commitment to improving the game, with updates that address player feedback and introduce new content, which keeps the community engaged.

---

**Critiques:**
- **Learning Curve:** New players may find the mechanics and strategies somewhat complex at first. A more structured tutorial or guide could help ease newcomers into the game.
- **Balance Issues:** Occasionally, the balance between thieves and police can feel off, depending on the map and player experience. Some matches may lean heavily in favor of one side, which can be frustrating.

---

**Conclusion:**
""Perfect Heist 2"" successfully combines strategy, teamwork, and a lighthearted approach to heists. Its asymmetrical gameplay offers a fresh take on the genre, encouraging players to think creatively and work closely with teammates. While there are some learning curves and balance issues, the overall experience is enjoyable and engaging.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fun, cooperative multiplayer game that emphasizes strategy and teamwork, ""Perfect Heist 2"" is highly recommended. It‚Äôs a great choice for players seeking both challenge and humor in their gaming experience.

**Overall Recommendation:** A solid pick for fans of multiplayer strategy games and those looking for a unique heist experience.",0.0,Positive

Pit People¬Æ,"Consider picking this up when it's on sale. It's a fun play with customization and a decent chunk of sidequests. The game can for sure be a hit or miss depending on whose playing it with its slow pacing and constantly similar and repeating battles. However, I think it has a lot of charms and a lot of uniqueness for the price at which it is presented. I do have to warn that the main focus of the game, the pit, is hardly functional due to the lack of players playing online at this point. Most thrilling experience in this game will most likely have to be solo or with a friend who has the game as well. There's also a bunch of mechanics with the capturing mechanic from customizable costumes, rare colored names, and epics for those who like to catch them all. You can not change the name though.",0.0,Positive
Pit People¬Æ,"The cutscenes and fluff are all very amusing and funny. I've laughed several times in my time with the game. Unfortunately, the gameplay becomes very tedious after only a brief period. The fights feel like they take too long and the lack of control on who you're targeting makes it impossible to really focus an enemy down.

If the fights had been a more quick and brutal affair it might have been worth a recommendation. Unfortunately, they stick around so long it makes the humor start to fall flat.

I can't say that I hate the game. I'm just very disappointed.",5.0,Negative
Pit People¬Æ,"Even though it is a bit short (even for me, and i drop games after 15-20 hours typically) pit people is a fantastic little strategy game with some zany characters and genuinely funny moments. A great behemoth game even if it didn't sell very well.",2.0,Positive
Pit People¬Æ,"I did not enjoy this game (did beat it). Ended up rushing the story just so it would end.

It is claimed to be a strategic game to last hours but I didn't find it that way at all. All you simply do is move your characters so they don't get hit, while also trying to attack the other enemies. I just don't see what some see in this game. I bought it hoping it would be as fun as there other games since it was the only one I haven't played, but it just wasn't for me. The game may not be bad or boring to all but to me it appeared to be so. I'm just warning those who aren't to sure about getting this game, if you like the fast action fighting or always on the go type play the other games have to offer, this is not it.",2.0,Negative

ShellShock Live,"[h1]It‚Äôs TANKS![/h1]
 
[i]There will be a TL;DR at the end.[/i]
 
~
 
The classic [b]Tanks[/b] game from the arcade cabinets to the now defunct flash applications.
But in this incarnation, there are lots of twists!
Tons of ammunition, modifiers, and little aspects keep the matches fun and interesting.
Most astounding, and clever, is the addition of a simple-yet-effective leveling system.

You begin by lobbing very basic projectiles over hills at your opponents, but as you level up higher, you begin launching assaults of deadly disco balls, killer kittens, holy beams of radiance, bird droppings, and much more.

It‚Äôs wickedly creative, and between matches you can level up your tank to have more armor, higher critical chance, better equipment, or vastly increased traversal. Lots of customization options too.

The tempo is sinister and strong as well - you‚Äôll hop into matches quickly, blow up your enemies (or get blown up yourself) and be going into the next match in record time with precious little downtime between.

It‚Äôs not much more over the original formula, and isn‚Äôt going to be captivating your heart and mind with novelties beyond the stars, but for what it is - it is strong.

It does have a shelf life. The core loop of lobbing things through the air to explode your enemy loses its finesse after a few hours - but it doesn‚Äôt push to overstay its welcome any.

Chatting with strangers while you embark on this silly, innocent, and simple game is a joy in and of its own.

[i]ShellShock Live[/i] is an [b]Above Average[/b] game.

The controls feel smooth and the aiming is accurate. Combat is fast paced and you always come equipped with a small arsenal of weapons ensuring you're ready for action. The maps are well designed and outrageous, and there are lots to chose from. There is also a nice variety in game modes and all are very unique and fun to play. The official servers are usually inactive, but you will still see some people playing from time to time. You can even host your own server and play with bots which is a nice addition and adds some challenge. I didn't myself but I can see playing this game with friends to be a blast. A lot of the time playing I felt as if I was in a Toy Story game which was cool and nostalgic. This game is very friendly and casual so its easy to enjoy and there is a lot of replay value. There are some minor menu user interface issues and the game can be a little buggy but its very minor and in a way adds to the charm. This game goes on sale for $1-$2 which is a great deal. Overall I enjoyed playing this game and its gets a big thumbs up and salute from me.

Game Review: Tower Unite

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)

Tower Unite is a vibrant multiplayer experience that masterfully blends social interaction, gaming, and creative expression. Developed by PixelTail Games, it serves as a spiritual successor to the beloved Garry's Mod mini-games, taking players to an expansive, persistent world filled with various activities.

Gameplay & Features: At its core, Tower Unite is a community hub where players can explore the titular Tower‚Äîa virtual space packed with different floors, each offering unique experiences. From arcade-style mini-games to a customizable apartment, the game is rich with options. You can play classic favorites like ‚ÄúVirus‚Äù and ‚ÄúMinigolf,‚Äù or try your hand at new games like ‚ÄúBall Race.‚Äù The mini-games are well-designed and provide a nice mix of competition and casual fun.

One of the standout features is the ability to customize your own space. Players can decorate their apartments with a variety of items earned through gameplay, creating a unique personal haven to showcase to friends. This adds a layer of investment and creativity, making each player‚Äôs experience feel personal.

Graphics & Sound: The graphics in Tower Unite are colorful and cartoonish, fitting perfectly with the lighthearted tone of the game. The environments are diverse and charming, from the bustling Tower itself to the serene landscapes found in mini-golf courses. Sound design complements the visuals well, with catchy tunes and playful sound effects that enhance the overall atmosphere.

Community & Social Interaction: The heart of Tower Unite lies in its community. The game encourages socialization, whether it‚Äôs teaming up for mini-golf, chatting in the plaza, or just hanging out in someone‚Äôs apartment. Events and updates keep the community engaged, with frequent additions to mini-games and seasonal content. The player base is generally friendly, making it easy for newcomers to jump in and feel welcomed.

Room for Improvement: While Tower Unite shines in many areas, it‚Äôs not without its minor flaws. Some mini-games can feel a bit unbalanced, and there are occasional technical hiccups, particularly with server stability during peak times. However, these issues are often outweighed by the overall enjoyment of the game.

Conclusion: Overall, Tower Unite is a delightful blend of gaming and social interaction that captures the essence of fun in a virtual playground. With its engaging mini-games, customizable spaces, and strong community focus, it offers something for everyone. Whether you‚Äôre a casual gamer or a social butterfly, Tower Unite is an absolute must-play. Grab your friends, dive into the Tower, and let the good times roll!",1.0,Positive

Worms_Ultimate_Mayhem,"Before playing I didn't think the worms formula would work in 3 dimensions. But after playing my opinions have drastically changed. Being a remake of Worms 4, the second 3D Worms game, Team 17 has had a lot of time to refine the 3D Worms gameplay to be as cohesive and functional as possible. The game in itself is simple; eliminate the enemy team. But, what makes the game so memorable is how you go about that. You have many different weapons at your disposal to carry out your objective, with different unique attributes that make them all feel unique. The bazooka is a good all-rounder weapon, and is usually my first pick. What sets it apart from most weapons is how it is affected by the wind, meaning you may need to adapt your battle plan to the conditions for your turn. The shotgun is another solid pick, being easy to aim, and feeling wonderful when you land a shot on a pesky enemy Worm. The game uses randomly generated 3D landscapes, meaning no two matches are the same. This level of variety gives Worms Ultimate Mayhem a unique level of replayability that makes it an easy choice when I want to play something. Overall, I'd say Worms Ultimate Mayhem is worth a try, being a unique spin on the Worms formula that gives the game a distinct identity. 9 Holy Hand Grenades out of 10.",2.0,Positive

Project Winter,"This game its really bad and can be frustrating IF YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS to play with you.
Only other players can crate servers, the problem is... There are just a few servers in the game that are created by other players, and most of then i just got kicked when i wanted to play with human beings.
Not with a good reason most of the times.
There are a few reasons why they do that:
- Dont speak too well their language
- You have a bad ping
- Dont have a mic
- They dont know you and want to play with their friends (Then why make the server public...?)
- No reason, some times they dont go with your face
Sure, this game its made and focused in the multiplayer, so of course you will want to play it with your friends, its just a shame that the community its not that welcome...
That doesn't mean you will have always a bad experience, we cant generalize eveything, and there are a lot of kind and nice people, its just rare.

So, in general, the game its good, you will just have a bad experience if you play alone or with random people, so, if you want to buy it, buy with your friends!",0.0,Negative

It's a lot to learn, but the players I was with were more than willing to help.

But otherwise, it seems pretty cool and I'd play it again solo or with people I know.

Even if you play just for 3-4h with friends, it's worth buying in my opinion, especially if you got in when on sale like I did (cost me like 4$ for the base game and the DLC).

IDK about playing with random players though. Might not be as fun, but IDK.

2 things that could be improved maybe :

1) Traitors are too strong? Or we were too bad at the game to have a chance of winning as survivors.
2) Improve specific Quality of Life (QoL) stuff like when you're trying to interact with items or with the environment, automatic inventory management when crafting or other, etc.

Like I said, if you don't like longer games, maybe you'll just prefer Among Us.",0.0,Positive

Super Animal Royale,"Very cute and very easy to learn, hard to master. It's a casual and pretty fun arcadey shooter with lots of room for growth. And unlike Fortnite every 3 months, almost every SAR update is a total positive and barely changes the core game.

Matches are pretty fast-paced so action is quick and losing doesn't feel as bad. There's also always a rotating LTM that ditches squads for either a zombie infection or a 32v32 conquest game.

Progression is entirely cosmetic and the monetization is among the least predatory out of any live service game currently. There's few truly FOMO items as nearly every unlockable/purchasable item can be gotten from a rotation or working on an older season's battle pass.

Super Animal Royale,"I've been around this game for a good 4-5 years now, and I can confidently say it's a wonderful experience!
The community's awesome, the dev team's very kind, the animals are super cute (and deadly!), the lore is [i]surprisingly[/i] deep, and the gameplay's nice and simple!
Awesome for when you want to jump in quick and play a 6 minute or less match!

The way Super Animal Royale does its battle passes (called Animal Passes) is also unlike most I've seen! All are permanent and purchasable via the archives through SAW Tickets when a new one releases, which I think more games should do! You can also progress the current pass and a past one [b]AT THE SAME TIME![/b]

With the Super Animal World expansion on the horizon, and a new update that released as of writing this review, now is a great time to drop in for free! You also get the newest pass (By Popular Request is what it's named) [b]FOR FREE[/b] until the expansion releases!

P.S. No, you don't have to be a furry to enjoy SAR. I'm an animal lover myself who found a game with cute animals and mythological creatures that praise a banan, and decided to play! I could be one if I wanted, but...

ibb & obb,"For the first half, the game is extremely fun. Visually it's distinct and pleasing, the music is also very good, and solving the puzzles with your friend is an all-around great experience.
However, in the second half, there is a rise of timing-based ""puzzles"" that become increasingly harder to pull off and are just way too frustrating for such a co-op game. At some point, it morphed into a co-op Super Meat Boy and that shows because only 9% even completed this game.",0.0,Positive
ibb & obb,"Ibb and obb is one of those games that didn't immediately click with me. The pacing of the first few levels was quite slow. The levels were rather easy and didn't introduce many fresh ideas that would keep you very engaged. But the more you played, harder the game got. The levels remained structurally simple but the puzzle how to beat them got more and more difficult in terms of skill and the correct order of jumps and movement. This is where it lays the game's geniusness. With very few elements it does a lot. But both players will need to be equally able to perform difficult jump/movement patterns as the game trully requires cooperation and correct timing. For many levels it took us many many attempts. It was quite stressful as you need to complete a whole set of levels before the game saves your progress. Here I think the game could have implemented save feature at each major checkpoint, as the levels require your full brain and motorical skills which is exhausting.

Art styile by itself is not my favourite but i fully appreciate the commitment to the gradiental art direction. Music is also great. My only complaint is that the game should have a bit more dynamic ideas in terms of level design. Levels are great but to keep the common player engaged they would need some more concepts that would keep it fresh. Something like driving a car through obsticales or other kind of coordinated cooperation between two players.

Overall I recommend this game for any duo that seeks good puzzle platforming challenge.",1.0,Positive

ibb & obb,"I loved this game! It's not a simple game that you can rush through in a game. It takes actual teamwork and often precise timing to get through some of the obstacles. The little characters are super cute and the atmosphere can seem misleading, if you're looking for something simple that doesn't require much brainpower. It can get frustrating, but I enjoy the fact that some real thought and effort has to be put into the game. I appreciate that breaks were needed between every couple of levels. The achievements aren't easy to get, as well. Some seem near impossible. However, again, if you enjoy a challenge and the cute fun, this is a great game!",1.0,Positive

ibb & obb,"Cute puzzle-platformer with relaxing music and extremely frustrating gameplay.
Do not buy this game if you have no platformer experience.
The puzzles are good, with a few harder but still interesting ones.
However, some levels will require very precise inputs, especially with [spoiler] bubble physics [/spoiler] [spoiler] the final boss [/spoiler].",0.0,Positive
ibb & obb,"My favorite duo game. The teamwork aspect of this game is really fun, exciting, and satisfying. You definitely need a lot of patience to play this game, though, since a lot of the puzzles/progression requires some specific timing and if you and your partner aren't in sync it takes lots of attempts.

Also, the art/graphics are very pretty.",0.0,Positive
