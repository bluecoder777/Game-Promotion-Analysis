The fusion has a 1 minute length and a 1 minute cooldown after use, makes the attacks stronger and slightly bigger, now takes 2 instead of 1 hits to kill (unless you squish the fused players) both players need to have this ability and it takes around 3 seconds to fuse as the players need to press the certain Keys, if not the fusion will fail and will be WAY weaker, having twice the long cooldowns and moves slower.",UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,1,UCs8AuzS2-73TFPh4dTl39ng,2024-09-27 06:32:41

JPekiqHWeuM,2024-08-13T16:47:47Z,"Ability ideas:
Hadouken kind of ability
-exponentially speeds up after you launch it
-when it hits something, it has a blast radius based on how long it's travelled
-can be affected by other explosions or abilities (say, grapple or mines)
-leaves an energy circle behind for approx. 10 seconds that's slightly smaller than the blast itself and kills anyone that touches it

Homing missiles (not sure if you did this one already)
-also speeds up the longer it flies
-would make for some cool combos like grappling the missile to fly to your enemy
-you get the point

Spike ball (i wasn't sure what to call this one)
-basically puffs up your character and adds spikes everywhere around it
-makes you float for as long as you use the ability
-holdable
-chargeable (affects the size of the spike ball)
-if used too long, makes your character pop and die

Fusion ability
-if two players have this equipped, they can fuse into one single big blob
-the fusion wears off after some time
-the fused blob has all the abilities the two fused blobs harness
-has a special ability that basically works like a ground pound (jump, use in air, smashes you down onto the platform under you)
-every player gets to control the fused blob for half the time it stays fused",UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,0,UC3XQHbL8ZJ8MaHBH3cbjABQ,2024-10-11 16:48:17

For the turret maybe the bullets have gravity so if they're pointing up the bullets will fall down also you can make them have like a tracking ability where the bullets don't follow you but the turret will follow wherever enemy players are and shoot them or in their last position or it could shoot bombs and also the explosion or poison explosion could also combo with that by turning the bullets into poison bullets

-Make that you can only place 1 cannon and that the next times you use the ability it would fire a bullet

You can also make that if the player holds the ability button, the cannon would start a contdown to self destruct (killing the nearby players). This would allow the player to replace the cannon where he wants.

- Make the cannon work like in Ultimate Chiken Horse: you can shoot an item by throwing it into the cannon (like granades, smoke granades, arrows...)

the reason why i want this is because this actually happens in real life when an objects mass becomes too  small it becomes into a tiny blackhole that will soon burst out and eat mostly everything...",UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,7,UC3V5-J_-rwpmxXUl8C8oMcg,2024-07-19 00:35:33
0r0ZtLRL9O8,2023-12-28T19:42:14Z,"Suggestions: 
1. Make the drill cut platforms in half or add a saw ability that does that
2. Grappler ability which pulls platforms or players to your location
3. E.M.P Stun
4. Infinitely sized map
5. Pocket dimension ability

0r0ZtLRL9O8,2023-12-28T19:42:14Z,"Yeah, this was a great balance update! Only thing I feel is still needed is allowing certain abilities (rock, sonic, drill, etc.) to be able to deal with time stop without dying in the process. Maybe just making it so you can only use time stop if grounded, but reducing the time it takes to stop time would be a good change. Idk tho, you‚Äôre the dev.",UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,11,UC5k0f4agxTI9vsXFC0rYfAg,2023-12-28 19:53:41
