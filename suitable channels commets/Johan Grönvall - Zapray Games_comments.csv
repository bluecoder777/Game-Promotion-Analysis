The fusion has a 1 minute length and a 1 minute cooldown after use, makes the attacks stronger and slightly bigger, now takes 2 instead of 1 hits to kill (unless you squish the fused players) both players need to have this ability and it takes around 3 seconds to fuse as the players need to press the certain Keys, if not the fusion will fail and will be WAY weaker, having twice the long cooldowns and moves slower.",UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,1,UCs8AuzS2-73TFPh4dTl39ng,2024-09-27 06:32:41

JPekiqHWeuM,2024-08-13T16:47:47Z,"Ability ideas:
Hadouken kind of ability
-exponentially speeds up after you launch it
-when it hits something, it has a blast radius based on how long it's travelled
-can be affected by other explosions or abilities (say, grapple or mines)
-leaves an energy circle behind for approx. 10 seconds that's slightly smaller than the blast itself and kills anyone that touches it

Homing missiles (not sure if you did this one already)
-also speeds up the longer it flies
-would make for some cool combos like grappling the missile to fly to your enemy
-you get the point

Spike ball (i wasn't sure what to call this one)
-basically puffs up your character and adds spikes everywhere around it
-makes you float for as long as you use the ability
-holdable
-chargeable (affects the size of the spike ball)
-if used too long, makes your character pop and die

Fusion ability
-if two players have this equipped, they can fuse into one single big blob
-the fusion wears off after some time
-the fused blob has all the abilities the two fused blobs harness
-has a special ability that basically works like a ground pound (jump, use in air, smashes you down onto the platform under you)
-every player gets to control the fused blob for half the time it stays fused",UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,0,UC3XQHbL8ZJ8MaHBH3cbjABQ,2024-10-11 16:48:17

Platform break - not an ability, but whenever the drill or explosions affect the platform too much, it breaks.

Shield -  allows you to block some abilities, has a time limit though.

Combine - you can combine with your clones to get bigger.

Separate - you can break apart into smaller clones, can't get too small thought.

Hammer - it would basically break platforms in half, could be more of a punch or something. You could also make it so the pebble bits are like a shotgun.

Op abilities - basically add abilities that are so op that they only allow the one. 

Bouncing Betty - it is basically a cannon or shotgun that bounces off of platforms, only bounces a few times though.

Push - if your close enough to someone you can push or launch them in a direction.

Oil spill - makes your slime trail flammable, could be useful and useless in different conditions.",UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,0,UCPJLsP8Cj-b88GMiy3OXU5A,2024-09-25 11:16:25

Edit: also the bullets don‚Äôt hurt the same color of the Bopl that there on. Also they can only bounce if there‚Äôs slime or those expandy things I don‚Äôt know what there called of the same color on the ground also you can target them to shoot into a black hole on the screen (if there is one) to make it grow bigger and the turret glows when it attacks.Edit2: now I‚Äôm changing the charge ability once it‚Äôs charged you can press a button to activate the explosion and if you die before press the button then you still explode and it charges much faster than usual sometimes even covering the entire map (this is a another move for when the players can‚Äôt get to each other) also it kills players instead of pulling them in.

For the turret maybe the bullets have gravity so if they're pointing up the bullets will fall down also you can make them have like a tracking ability where the bullets don't follow you but the turret will follow wherever enemy players are and shoot them or in their last position or it could shoot bombs and also the explosion or poison explosion could also combo with that by turning the bullets into poison bullets

0r0ZtLRL9O8,2023-12-28T19:42:14Z,"Idea: make a level that the point is its dark and you can only see a circle around you and then make an ability that puts a light down that lets you see, but to make it useful in not dark levels make it that the light will make the area you place it in too bright and blinding, so you can see there",UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,0,UCOYDrxvBZxOxczwvDZGI0qg,2024-02-05 13:56:28
0r0ZtLRL9O8,2023-12-28T19:42:14Z,Played the game. Smoke bombs was my favourite tactic. Good game.,UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,0,UCWlppCMr2JLzLjkswW603ug,2024-07-05 10:22:00
0r0ZtLRL9O8,2023-12-28T19:42:14Z,Game ability idea. 20 second cooldown. ALL players screen goes black for 3 seconds. It could be useful especially with combo-ing cas people may panic or they may freeze and it could give you an advantage if you remember the map and movement.,UCalc80nzzbREWYmRkERy5JA,0,UCiq9WJkwnQ-1MBIkggg2epA,2024-09-14 02:04:17
