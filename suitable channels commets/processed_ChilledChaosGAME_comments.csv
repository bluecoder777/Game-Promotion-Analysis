Everyone writes down a number between 1 and 6, six candies and one six-sided die are passed to every player and then the cards are dealt. 

When someone is called successfully or someone calls unsuccessfully, the losing player rolls the die and is eliminated if the result is the same as the number they wrote down.

In Silence is just phenomenal.
If they added just like:
- 3 more maps
- 2 more monsters with variant abilities like:
- - wall climbing
- - leaping onto roofs
- - hiding in trees
- - making spiderweb traps to alert the monster and ensnare survivors
- - like a ""static fog"" that drains batteries and blinds the survivors in a specific area for a while (so they're just as blind as the monster)
- - some sort of attack that makes the survivors drop items
- - chameleon invisibility when they stay completely still
- - better vision when they stay completely still
- like 2-3 more objectives
- - build a broadcaster to call the cops/military/park rangers/whatever and survive til they arrive
- - concoct poison darts for dart guns
- - ""pushing a series of carts"" TF2-style
- - fixing generators like DBD

Probably has to play like the Stalker from that other game. Slowly pick people off for the most part while remaining out of sight, taking advantage of survivors own flashes and never attacking when everyone's able to unload on them when huddled up or set up in a building, playing the patience game. 

It's the survivors on a timer, and if you make them FEEL like they can't rush and HAVE to clear every corner and set up in buildings, you'll win due to time. Like a DBD killer, except without the lack of actual time limit for survivors. Also, like Friday the 13th with the same difference, but survivors can also kill you quite easily. But the added atmosphere of needing to be careful AND silent but it's open-mic both ways should make for some good horror content for close-knit or play together groups with mic-usage-for-content players.",UCpmu4uEZ8XcPjHdHh7_zFOg,0,UCMGMiMLYPY9hvE0ddGjYrow,2024-10-17 04:06:59

6vKPdxnUojA,2024-10-15T00:26:30Z,"In liar's dice there's roughly an 80% chance that a player has any specific number.

With 4 people there is about 3.3~ copies of any number spread between players.

With 3 it's 2.5

With 2 it's 1.7~

So, chances are good, but not perfect, that betting that everyone has any number is safe. Roughly 80%. If you don't have that number, and someone bets that there are 4+ of that number, then calling liar is pretty safe. If you have more then 1 then you can bet that there are that many more than 4 at the table.

This doesn't take into account bluffs. If someone bets there are 4 of a number then you could assume that they have 1 or 2 of that number. 1 is a bit risky, but 2 would make it basically garuanteed to be true. They, of course, could be lying and have none of that number. They could also bet there are 7 of a number out there claiming they rolled 5 of them. In which case you have to determine for yourself whether they managed that or they're lying. This is about the extent of the bluffs in liars dice.

6vKPdxnUojA,2024-10-15T00:26:30Z,"Generally the idea of liars dice, in an honest setting, is that you call out how many dice you have under your cup, then the next person adds theirs to the total count, and so on. Eventually it would get back to you and you can't honestly raise your dice number anymore because you already called all of your dice of that number. Forcing you to either lie or call the previous person a liar. So in order to really play the game, you can either low ball your number so you can then raise it when it gets back to you, or you can high ball it and poison the well for when it gets back to you. If everyone else honestly reported the number of dice, then you can call out the last person as a liar confidently because you already know you bet higher than you had.",UCpmu4uEZ8XcPjHdHh7_zFOg,5,UCytMRPAmhQIjIUKqK3H3YFw,2024-10-15 06:18:52
