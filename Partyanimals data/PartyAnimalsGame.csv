This guy was above and beyond just being rude af, the pair of Lava Maneki's politely typed into the chat in the lobby if people could let them try for the achievement where you stay on the plane 'till it's almost time up...the Assassin Levi legitimately made it known from the get-go that he was going to aim to ruin it and pretty much every game he gunned for the maneki's, I decided to try and help them out even though I have already gotten the achievement a long time ago...and they were super appreciative...but it all kinda went down the drain and we couldn't stay alive as long as the first time even employing some tips from Vicksy using weapons to balance ourselves and a few other strats I taught them just by emoting.

I didn't expect this KofiS dude to really come and send me a friend request (I mistook it was one of the Maneki's not paying a great deal of attention to names) and friended me just to drop a few lengthy paragraphs mocking me as a person and saying ""It was the greatest feeling in the world to deny you that stupid achievement""...when I explained I already had it and told him politely to stop being a cyber bully for no reason other than to bully people trying to have some fun...he got fuming...funny how for once I wasn't even being targeted and then get targeted for helping some poor achievement hunters lol.",2024-10-17 02:56:36,5,

My friend and I almost died, we didn't expect a grown man to talk to a child like that lmao. It was so unexpected, we thought he was actually going to give the kid some pointers.

I used to have a friend like that a long time ago that would complain to me, about myself, being okay with losing, but like, you get another chance. Loss is an experience you gain from, and you'll either do better next time, or, you'll just enjoy yourself regardless of the result. Games are meant to be fun, winning or losing, it's still meant to be fun. I can't imagine how stressful these people's lives must be, getting that angry over losing and then feeling a need to dis people if they do manage to win...

It's entirely possible it may make a come back. Unless you see an actual message from the dev team, there's no way to know. But based on the players I've seen, no one really uses om nom, but many use Ori. So it makes sense that Ori came back from a usage standpoint.",2024-10-15 23:22:06,3,

submission,gabepleasee,üìù Patch Notes 1.8.4.0 ,"Version 1.8.4.0 (2024.10.11)

üîã Optimizations

1. Adjusted bar stools in Winter Cabin to make them easier to place upright and less likely to be thrown onto the card table. 
2. Improved the experience of purchasing vending machine items with different currencies in Winter Cabin. 
3. In Ring of Garfat, standing or hanging on the four pillars or staying on the outer platform for too long will now cause the character to catch fire and lose HP. 
4. Optimized the pathfinding of the Mechanical Cat and added stairs to certain areas in The Lab mission. 
5. Slowed down the recovery speed of stunned Croco enemies in The Lab mission. 
6. Enhanced AI enemies with the ""Berserker"" Pawer in Black Sails mission, making them less likely to stun themselves with nunchucks. 
7. Nerfed AI enemies with the ""Rocket Kick"" Pawer in Black Sails mission, reducing their jump kick frequency. 
8. In Black Sails mission, players cannot exit the cannon mode until the enemy ship approaches, at which point they are forced out. 
9. In Cast Away mission, the player's recovery speed from being stunned during the BOSS phase is increased 
10. In Cast Away mission, after completing the three-cannon phase, returning to the area and dying will no longer respawn AI enemies or broken rocks. 
11. In Cast Away mission, optimized two gap areas where players could get stuck, now causing players to die and reset position if stuck. 
12. Added a target mark on the large rocks in the three-cannon phase in Cast Away mission. 
13. Removed the bomb-throwing prompt during the BOSS cutscene in Cast Away mission.

üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

1. Fixed an issue in Custom Game where the voice chat range settings would get stuck when there is only one player in the lobby. 
2. Fixed an issue in private rooms where clicking the lock button mid-game would unlock the lobby instead of displaying the password. 
3. Fixed an issue where players‚Äô online/invisible status changes were not displayed in real-time in their profiles. 
4. Fixed an issue in Winter Cabin where placing a swing would cause the ESC key to stop working for other players. 
5. Fixed an issue in Winter Cabin where the balance of Treats could display incorrectly in certain situations. 
6. Fixed an issue in Ring of Garfat where boomerangs would pass through rock walls and fail to return. 
7. Fixed an issue in Nemo Kart where using the ""Shield"" item could cause players to drive out of the playable area under certain conditions.

Hating the change about standing outside the ring too long. 1) After getting up there I stand there briefly to restore my stamina so I don't die immediately once back in the ring. 2) People already try to keep people from getting back in the ring, so now those people trying not to be knocked out for trying to get back in are just gonna die bc of this new timer. 3) There's an achievement for not getting hit by rocks and stuff that some people may be trying to get, and this timer will mess that up as well.

comment,Orangusoul,Nemo Kart Seems to Be a Mode With Pay-To-Win Elements,"In party games, I believe winning isn't the be-all and end-all of things. So I'm not sure the pay-to-win label necessarily applies.

I disagree with other commenters who are calling not having all the karts a skill issue. At max, you get around 220 gears per race. The 3 most expensive base version karts cost 7500 gears total. That means if you're playing perfectly, you'd need to play 35 matches of nemo Kart to even expirement with just those 3 other karts. With only 3 maps, no one is playing the game 35+ times.

There's definitely a pricing issue with the gears in this regard. I'm not sure I like the hidden aspects of the karts. I'd like for it to say what makes each one different from the others, just so we could knowingly play to their strengths and enjoy the system they developed.",2024-10-07 17:28:34,1,
comment,Anonymous_Player132,Nemo Kart Seems to Be a Mode With Pay-To-Win Elements,"""In party games, I believe winning isn't the be-all and end-all of things."" 

You're absolutely right on that front. Party games, perhaps more than any other type of interactive experience, thrive or fail based on how well their moment-to-moment interactions with other players are designed for fun's sake. Still, the concepts of victory and failure are important parts of social spaces. They give meaning to those crucial moment-to-moment interactions, as well as allow for more of those interactions to be created. For a few examples, I've cheered on random teammates after I was defeated in *Party Animals*'s other game modes and privately cursed opponents' bloodlines for stealing a victory from me in any of its modes while having a laugh. 

With all that in mind, winning is not the only important part of Nemo Kart, but, nevertheless, it is **one** of them. And, that means that the implementation of Nemo Bucks in this mode corrupts the previously described fun of *Party Animals* on this side of it, a side that cannot be healthily evolved if its beginnings involve unnecessary trouble.",2024-10-07 17:58:06,2,

comment,Sakiros,Opinions?,"Black Hole would have been perfect if it wasn't for the random stamina drain jank when holding onto objects while the hole is active.

comment,Cj_91a,Opinions?,"Ive always assumed you are basically not allowed to survive the final black hole because it will purposely drain all of your stamina. However on very VERY rare occasions I've seen people survive it by sheer luck like bomb detonation at last sec of a black hole finishing and sending the player out of the middle zone.

Hence why in black hole I alaays make it a point to avoid the chain. It's not necessary to use it until the 3rd black hole anyways. It's the 4th black hole that becomes luck based. What I tend to do though when it comes to stamina is not grab the chain or anything until the blackhole actually starts. If you grab anything too early, it starts a stamina drain even if the black hole hasn't actually started moving anything. Timing seems to be everything",2024-10-06 12:27:46,1,
comment,Sakiros,Opinions?,"I avoid the chain too until the 4th hole but you're not safe with the heavy drums and cases either, the quick drain can happen very early on, even on the second and third holes. I don't know what triggers it but it's practically unpredictable.",2024-10-06 12:42:24,1,

Kinda same situation with Wind Tunnel, there's just no clean strat to what exactly you should be doing and many awkward moments of just sharing shields/cover moments with people, whom typically are gonna resume beating you to a pulp cause you were the one having to hold the lever and need a second to get outta cover/leaned position lmao.",2024-10-06 08:38:45,3,

comment,nobod3,How are they throwing me so high into the sky and far away,"Grab the body when possible, the head weighs more so when you swing a person from the body it adds momentum.  You can‚Äôt just toss bodies either, have to give them a twirl to add some momentum.",2024-10-05 20:42:11,19,
comment,redditnoob_threeve,How are they throwing me so high into the sky and far away,"To add to this, don't grab feet or arms. It's almost impossible to get a good toss when grabbing by them. Only head, only body, or combo of body and head together result in the best spin throws.

I personally prefer back of body and head combo as it let's you pick up almost the full weight of the body. Grabbing from the back also reduces the chances of a headbutt, punch, and most kicks reaching you. 

Once you get timing down for how long it takes for someone to get up, you can also calculate if you want to go for a body grab and risk getting wake up kicked, or  if you want to go for the head only so you can headbutt them when they get wake up. Just takes time and practice. 

There's different times for being knocked out depending  on what knocked you out. Bomb explosions don't knock out for long but if you get hit with the bomb directly you get knocked out for way longer. Getting furniture dropped on you (blackhole) will knock you out the longest. This also applies on the ring of garfat where the non flaming rocks fall on you. The flaming rocks do knock you out but not nearly as long.

It's a mechanic built into the game to prevent people from just grabbing and stun locking everyone. It works the same if someone is grabbing onto you, just keep running, punching, etc and it will drain their stamina more. Even one of the tips say it on the loading screen.

This can also be applied to things like the football map. If you both grab the ball, but one of you sprints, it will cause the sprinter to lose stamina faster. Sometimes it's better to just let them tire themselves out and not sprint, then just walk away with the ball.",2024-10-06 19:00:22,1,

comment,redditnoob_threeve,How do you get cool skins,"As far as I know, any keyboard that connects via USB. That can mean either wireless dongle or direct cable. I would recommend the most basic of keyboards to ensure no incompatibility. So no volume controls, extra function keys, RGB, etc.

I'd recommend a small wireless one if you don't already have a keyboard on hand. Arteck has a small keyboard that I can't confirm compatibility with, but should work and it's only $16. There are others out there too. Doesn't have to be expensive, but you get what you pay for.

My keyboard is no longer being made which is why I didn't list it.",2024-10-13 18:48:44,2,

I know stamina is factored but I usually try to keep that in check. Another issue why I'm having no fun anymore is playing smash or classic I get paired up with bots. It's pretty blatant when my team members knock me out, walking into walls or just straight up afk not helping.

Only way for you to know and to form a judgment is to play the game yourself and hopefully having fun in the process.",2024-10-04 02:19:34,7,

comment,Supernaut8086,I'm slowly losing fun with this game,"I mean does it suck not being able to win at least a round in smash when I'm trying my hardest and my teammate is practically no help yeah. Is it a skill issue that I'm having with landing a hit, probably. Is there an rng factor when a clear hit to an opponent either heavy punch or dropkick glances off the player, just might be. Compared to last year when I got the game where punches felt they were hitting and drop kicks were landing and the game was still balanced where no one player was clearly dominating it was fun win or lose but now when I can barely get hits to connect and when they do again zero damage done it's pretty easy to be on a ""tilt""",2024-10-04 02:23:57,1,

comment,Heartycorn,Tips for becoming better ,"Do what you are good at.  I'm not a fighter.  But the game is survive not get kills.  Learn the maps.  For example: in black hole, the 3 orange items aside from the orange spool ( the 4th and smallest) are safe to grab till the last round where you go in the whole even if you are holding the chain ( unless you have drunk super drink).  In ice breaker the small ice cube in the middle is last to go under.  In ichiban, the walls are safer than being on top of the platform in the last 30 seconds unless the fog is retreats dead center ( and the person with the highest stamina will survive longer if in the same level of fog) so light punch and jump. Do not sprint with 30 seconds left.  If it is by the side jump off and hang on the wall close to the top low enough that they can't headbutt you. In wind tunnel levers are sor suckers stay on the wall side and let the other person waste their stamina keeping you alive. In Conveyer do barrel rolls.",2024-10-03 23:51:03,3,

comment,YourDrinkIsSafeWitMe,Love this game but why so many sweatsü§î,"You're not good at the game, though. We all just watched you ignore your surroundings to grab a bomb twice, get punished for it both times by players that were on your screen (they didn't come out of nowhere, you ignored them and went for the item). But they are sweats for ""checks notes"" not letting you grab the bomb for free? Like for that second bomb grab you definitely have the horse blinders on staring at blue in the distance even though green is right in front of you squared off to you ready to deliver that drop kick to a stationary target. Try to tell us honestly this wasn't a misplay on your part because you were mad at the blue dude for knocking your socks off a few seconds before. Like at least you kind of walked away from the blue guy in the first encounter but you stopped dead in your tracks after throwing the bomb almost like your bot brain had to slowly calculate what to do next and as soon as blue was the right distance to heavy punch they just had to hit heavy punch. Since you weren't moving the spacing wasn't changing making that an easy heavy punch for blue to hit. smh",2024-10-03 16:33:53,8,

Several of my friends had the same issue when they first started playing. Lots of wiffs and misses that they swear should have landed, or attacks that connected but was just shrugged off by the player like it was nothing.

Now after some experience they are able to land most of their attacks and knock out the other players pretty regularly. My guess is its about the power behind a hit, where on the player a hit is landing and possibly even the angle, probably some other factors.

To earn points for your team, you have to be back in your original faction. 

This is why team woof is gaining, because a lot (since the majority of people were favoring meow from the get go) of the original meow faction members are currently getting the skins on the woof faction so meow isn't earning as many points right now.",2024-10-01 22:22:26,6,

At the end my team ended up losing to a blue team because my partner got item focused and knocked into the water. No big deal. 

Then we reque and go to a new match of beast hockey. I immediately noticed this essy guy was on our team. Instead of being normal and letting it go even though we lost. He spent the entire match chasing after me and not even doing it well. We still only lost by one with being down a player. Right afterwards my partner and I both reported him for trolling teammates. Idk if anyone has had this happen before. But what is the likelihood they'll punish him for it? It's just annoying and childish behavior. For added detail I did look at his profile and he's level 100 which somehow made it more sad because he was not very good. Pretty quickly after the report I noticed his profile disappeared from my recents. ",2024-09-30 17:50:05,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1ft1ti4/reporting_for_gameplay_reasons/

The only skins purchasable after the event concludes are the Archangels. If there are skins you want on the dog side you have to earn/buy them during the pass.

submission,Lil_CrowUnofficiall,The emp in nemo kart,"The emp needs a rework or it needs to be removed. It seems like a good idea in concept but actually using it is very lackluster. In my experience, rng only gives you the emp when you‚Äôre far behind. And unlike the robot or the rocket launcher, you don‚Äôt know who it affects because it‚Äôs random. It doesn‚Äôt give you much of a boost because it‚Äôs random tends to only hit players near the front. And on the side that gets hit with it, I feel like it lasts too long and makes some games completely unwinable, without even helping the player who used it. The game is fun when it‚Äôs possible to come back at any point or lose the lead at any point making you stay focused, but it makes it a whole lot less fun if you lose to a cheap item that doesn‚Äôt do much for the person who uses it. 
I feel like an easy fix to the emp would be to make it effect everyone but the person holding it. Make it only obtainable by the person who‚Äôs in 8th. The duration should be shorter and rng should only recognize it as a Hail Mary type of item where it can only be received at the last or second to last lap. The person in last probably still won‚Äôt win but an item that gives the last person a free win is something that should never be added to the game. The item would only be added to give everyone a fair chance instead of just screwing over one or two people. 
Now I understand the game isn‚Äôt meant to be taken seriously, the base game is one of the goofiest games ever made, but in the base game there‚Äôs no item that makes it impossible to win against.

comment,RichResponsibility19,Free Egg Coin,"Idk the full count but once you hit lvl 100 that's the cap and afterwards you get 3 daily lvl ups and you earn a mystery box for each one.

comment,B00mB3,Free Egg Coin,"I can‚Äôt echo this enough. Save the Nemo bucks for skins that are only Nemo bucks. You‚Äôll get plenty of egg coins as you play and will eventually get Most of the stuff from the egg coins. Also another tip, when in the store menu, go to the top right. I forget which tab, might be the egg coin tab, anyhow, you can choose the legendary you are after and after getting a few legendaries that aren‚Äôt the one you want, then it will guarantee it will be that one. It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve done it, but it lays it out for you once you are on the screen.",2024-09-29 16:25:45,4,

comment,RichResponsibility19,Free Egg Coin,This isn't really a game where you need to minmax. It's a pretty casual game. You get skins pretty easily just by leveling up and saving cookies.

So if you earn 1125 score, you earn 150 treats after conversion.

EDIT: If you have someone and want to speedrun it, in PAWS you earn 10 points per remaining card, so if your friend skips and picks up 113 cards, you earn the cap in one go. (Takes about 8-9 minutes.) For Fishy Business, it's per played card on board. Not sure how many points per card but its somewhere around there.

EDIT2: The deck no longer holds infinite cards. As a result, you MUST close the game out (win) to earn treats. **You will not earn treats** if you win by having the lower amount of cards when the deck is empty.",2024-09-29 00:07:01,1,

turns out, its fun just running around knocking other animals out, despite losing the round. Many times i just shrug and just laugh about it. Players arent toxic, and they generally have friendly vibes in custom matches. 

plus, the characters are so darn cute.

and whilst the game isnt as thriving as it was when it came out, they still give out new update contents, free battlepass, and healthy user numbers so you will be matched without waiting for too long.",2024-09-28 13:33:18,9,

I'm a new player to Party Animals and I got an update just today that got the game pretty crazy. The timer its constantly beeping at 0 seconds, some wins doesn't give out the crown for the last standing mode and conveyor map has its 3 conveyors spinning at max speed since second 0. Is this normal? How long does it usually take the team to fix these bugs? It is pretty annoying imo.

submission,billymj04,Nemo Kart's Controls are Beyond Broken!,"Whenever I'm playing Nemo Kart, I'll end up losing games purely because the controls are so janky! The two biggest examples I've dealt with are:

- When I'm holding down the LT button, it randomly decided to just not register and results in my kart just--stopping & going because it keeps registering & unregistering my button push, resulting in a loss.

- THEN, there's the drift button, I press it to drift, & even though  I'm holding the button down, it'll just randomly choose to not register during the hold & just reset the drift, resulting in my turns getting screwed up & ANOTHER loss.

I can't possibly be the only one who's been having to put up with this crap! Has anybody else dealt with this? If so, how do I fix it?? I use controller, btw

After playing without controller, I can confirm; IT ALSO HAPPENS ON KEYBOARD! This gamemode is a fuckin' mess... üíÄ",2024-09-23 00:41:19,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1fn871h/nemo_karts_controls_are_beyond_broken/

comment,JustYourCommonMarz,New update is fire,"I like the update, but i have issues with it. I love the new Last stand map, and i do REALLY appreciate the new nemo kart tracks, however personally im a little dissapointed with snowville as it just feels so empty and like such a lackluster map. Shanghai by night is what you would expect, so im not that mad. The rainbow boosters do add another element of fun so I appreciate that. I also really like how you can select gamemodes without leaving now. The only thing i really dont like is that they added an entire new item shop with a stupid new currency that revolves around playing that stupid and boring board game (or paws, which isnt much better imo) when the main appeal of the game is fighting. Its very annoying, because unless i wanna waste all my nemo bucks I just gotta do it even tho its not the part of the game i (and most others for that part) care about. I like winter cabin, But i dont think 10+ skins should be basically locked behind it",2024-09-23 22:24:49,1,

submission,ItsyClover,Fishy Business Guide,"In the Winter Cabin there is a new game mode ‚Äúfishy business‚Äù it‚Äôs requires at least 3 players. 
When you spawn in you get assigned either you are team woof or team meow, 
Team Meow your job is to find out which of the three fish cards holds the treasure and distract team wood from getting it! 
Team Woof your job is to find out which of the three fish cards holds the treasure and make a direct path to it
If your path connects to one of the fish cards it will show you what‚Äôs under it, if it‚Äôs the treasure you win, if not you need to find the one it‚Äôs under.
You can replace yours or others tokens. 
If you are on team meow it‚Äôs good to pretend to help out your ‚Äúteammates‚Äù as to throw them off the scent!
Team woof it‚Äôs good to figure out who is on team meow and take their tokens and make sure to keep your teammates alive by replace any of their stolen tokens!
-Still figuring this out- You need three tokens to play most cards I believe the shovel token being stolen means you can‚Äôt place paths? And the mine cart and helmet I have no clue.
But if all three of your tokens are stolen you are out of the game!

Bomb cards destroy any one selected path.

comment,Sakiros,Fishy Business Guide,"I was playing in a group of six and for one game I got assigned the Meow team, then I lost and when Team Woof was shown as winners it was all five of the other players, I was the only Meow against five Woofs. Seeing how the game didn't even distribute us as 2v4 I can only surmise there can be just one Meow player... that, or I got extremely unlucky.

As for the paths, I'm not sure, I just place them in a way so that they connect and progress towards the treasure, the game itself determines the tiles where you can place the cards so you can't just put them anywhere.  I think it even rotates the orientation automatically? I want to play it more to learn all the ins and outs but I can't until the next week.",2024-09-25 15:19:41,1,

The no prize text bubble goes away in like 2 seconds so its easy to miss its kinda silly. If you do win a reward, a window will pop up and a red button to copy the code. the code will have Chinese text followed by the redemption code and then more Chinese text. In the case you think you saw that but missed it, you can check your rewards by clicking on the right button that is under the yellow button.

Also, keeping your mic open is a little annoying. We don't want to hear music, breathing, family talking in the background, chewing food, etc. It doesn't make you an asshole, but it's unnecessary. Just mute until you want to say something. And check your settings because, iirc, the default is only your teammate can hear you.

You end up throwing out the same person 4-5 times out only for them to climb back in. There's no effort now involved into avoiding getting thrown out when you can climb in. There's no point throwing people anymore. Unless you get lucky and throw them into the turbines on the Sub for example. Because there's simply no punishment to even using game mechanics.

comment,BanBanEvasion,Increased climbing speeds has killed the game.,"Typhoon has always been a snooze-fest. The only way to get consistent kills has always been with the propellers or the missile launchers.

comment,ObnoxiouslyLoudYawn,üéâ Party Animals - Alpha Test ,"There are 8,760 hours in a year. This game came out last September on the 20th (About a year one might say). Lets, for the sake of this explanation, say you slept 8 hours every day (That's about the general average for anybody). That leaves 5840 hours left in the year, or 16 hours a day of ""free time"". But not all that ""free time"" is free, as you must eat, bathe, poop, cook, etc. Lets say that takes about 3 hours of your day each day. That leaves 4745 hours left in a year, or 13 hours of ""free time"" a day. Assuming you HAVE spent 2400 hours playing Party Animals this past year, that would mean that you have spent on average 6.5 hours a day playing Party Animals. That is exactly HALF the amount of ""free time"" you have in a day 6.5h/13h.

comment,HarmlessTrash,PHYSICS CHANGE NEWS!!,"I'm sorry but what I'm seeing is not a full confirmation that everything will be reverted back to its initial state prior to the patches from a couple months ago like people have been asking for. It's sort of implied with the header ""physics changes"", but ""advanced or combo moves"" isn't a clear answer as to exactly what was temporary. Will the stamina cost of heavy punches and the fling be reverted or changed at all? Will the hit registry of heavy punches be restored? Is a heavy punch an ""advanced move"" ? Macros at face value have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that our heavy punches turned into pillow-fists that don't register. 

This type of communication from the devs is a step in the right direction, but keep in mind it was like pulling teeth to even get this response after literal months of community outcry that the game was going down the drain. I'm cautiously optimistic and I'll believe it when I actually see it / feel it myself in an upcoming patch.",2024-09-13 23:07:39,3,

That's just losing more of their player base. I can barely land anything in the game anymore, but others land almost every hit. It's very unfair and not fun to get knocked out back to back and take forever to wake up when others wake up before you can pick them up.


Them making a report option for macros, whatever that is, is just gonna probably end up with players mass false reporting.

comment,HarmlessTrash,PHYSICS CHANGE NEWS!!,"You're completely missing the point. It's not that the fling is the ONLY fun thing about the game. It's A thing that makes the game more fun than it is without it. And why restrict something that is by no means broken or overpowered? Are you seriously going to sit there and say the game is more fun/better off without it? 

You don't even know what the word exploit means. 

""An exploit is the use of a bug or glitch, or use elements of a game system in a manner not intended by the game's designers, in a way that gives a substantial unfair advantage to players using it."" 

Pressing three buttons in a sequence that literally anyone can do is not a ""substantial unfair advantage."" If you can't fling within like a day of trying to practice the move, you're frankly just garbage at the game. It's incredibly easy to do, no macros required. I taught every single one of my friends that plays how to do it in about 10 minutes. You are equally as likely to yeet yourself off the map or get KO'd by a random dropkick as you are to actually do something useful when you fling.",2024-09-14 03:33:55,0,

submission,Binkdeadpool,Nemo Kart Ideas,"I've been streaming quite a bit of the Nemo Kart Beta over the last couple of weeks and I can't wait for more content to be added to the mode. During the numerous times I've ran Nemo Raceway (not sure if it's official name), I've mused on the possibilities of upcoming additions. Not sure when the devs are planning on dropping new stuff, but a couple more tracks, and carts would be nice within the year. Nemo Kart has a lot of potential and I personally would love to see it thrive over the next year. 

Here's a few of the ideas I had:

‚Ä¢ Tracks
- Frosty Hills: A ""Cool""  track around a frosty forest near a Winter Cabin (like in Winter is Coming and/or Winter Cabin) along a coast where in the distance the Ice Breaker map could be seen.
- The Facility: Industrial track of Science! Drive around The Lab along Conveyors past the Blackhole and Wind Tunnels.
- Castle Yurusa: Castle Track featuring Castleween where on the last lap, the castle begins to crumble.
- Croco Jungle: Wild Jungle track with twisting paths in a dense jungle environment. Features locations Gator Valley and Beat Up Bridge!


‚Ä¢ Kart Designs 
- DIY Racer: A Midsized Downhill Derby Wooden Car specialized in Downhill Slopes; DIY Hot Rod variation that extends Boosts a small amount 
- Fresh Pinto: Lightweight Green Bean Pod Racer that Drifts tighter that other karts; Mean Bean variation slightly shortens time Frozen 
- Pirate Scooter: Heavy Pirate Ship Scooter that effects enemies more when making contact. The Cutthroat variation grants additional effects to enemies from explosives

‚Ä¢ Item Ideas
- Boomerang: Throw it forward a small amount in a wide arch, spinning out anyone hit by it
- Shock Gun: 5 Shots that Moderately Slow down anyone hit by it.
- Inflated Hammer: Has 3 uses to circle the hammer around your kart in a 360¬∞ motion, sending any enemies hit by it it the direction the hammer is swinging 

I tried to think of things that are already in Party Animals as a baseline since at least the assets are already in the game, just not implemented within Nemo Kart yet. Hopefully we get some new stuff soon for Nemo Kart, but until then I can dream and hope for the future.
Thanks for taking time to give this a read and feel free to add any input.",2024-09-12 20:44:48,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1ffcxta/nemo_kart_ideas/

comment,PixlPixii,üìù Patch Notes 1.7.8.0 ,"Really curious to know what counts as a macro and what doesn't. Can I get banned for using Steam Input for example? It has features like turbo functionality and button chords, though these aren't features I use. I only use Steam Input for enabling gyro aim when throwing objects from spectator mode, or turning the camera when climbing since my thumb is on the face button and I can't change the camera angle.

Hopefully there are clear rules somewhere because while I doubt you would get banned for Steam Input use, I don't know where they draw the line.",2024-09-12 19:23:42,7,

I kinda enjoyed having it happen the one time a streamer was in my lobby playing the biker Bacon, I had two witch Macchiatos just refusing to punch on me as the panda so I just goofed around with them and didn't actively attack anyone else on Gator Valley, eventually somehow everyone naturally got lobbed off or fell off and we'd just mess around until the bridge washed us off or we got spectator slammed with items...but the streamer was legitimately trying to get us reported for ""teaming"" despite we didn't raise a single fist at the others the entire game lmao.",2024-09-13 03:49:53,2,

2. Past events were to make another appearance so players new and old have the opportunity to earn skins they may have missed in the past. ",2024-09-10 18:53:10,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1fdpopk/revival/

comment,The_Slyest_Fox,Revival ,"Somewhat long explanation here, but they did a patch on July 12th which impacted a lot of the core combat functionality of the game. Then instead of just reverting to the old combat/physics like many players are asking for, they‚Äôve just kept on tweaking things further. Some examples include:

‚Ä¢Significantly nerfed heavy punches. These now 1) eat up a lot more stamina and 2) require you to already be sprinting to throw one successfully (which leads to them feeling delayed). If you‚Äôre not sprinting when you attempt a heavy punch, you‚Äôll just get a flurry of soft punches instead. When you are lucky enough to land one now, the increased stamina drain often prevents you from grabbing and tossing the opponent you just punched. 

‚Ä¢Originally banned ‚Äúmoves made by macro commands‚Äù, which most notably includes the fling (plus all the related moves like the fling throw and the Superman punch). They subsequently brought the fling back in a significantly diminished, stamina-draining capacity. 

‚Ä¢Made climbing significantly easier ‚Äî which was actually a welcome change in my opinion ‚Äî only to revert to climbing once again being a total crapshoot.

‚Ä¢Anecdotally, made the drop kick more powerful and capable of knocking out 2 opponents on one kick, only to quietly nerf it back.",2024-09-10 23:01:57,11,

We played a game today where it was so obvious that the other team was able to communicate and there was no chance of us winning without communication.

You don‚Äôt get that kind of strategic benefit. 
It would make sense if it was two teams of all randos but the frustration comes in when you are a duo team( or just a single player) and get thrown into team matches with big teams of four. 
It‚Äôs just not ideal for anyone. Plus if you‚Äôre constantly getting easy wins because you have an advantage, wheres the fun?

W as it's actually a really good game in terms of the bones it's got, though it has become much harder to get use to in terms of the way the devs messed with the fighting physics (As someone who started playing the game when it first hit Game Pass last September the fighting felt MUCH more crisp and reactive with the perfect toony bounce it needed to feel elastic/satisfying.) 

The L?...the community, plain as I can put it. To mildly elaborate: IMO the game has always been intended to be played with no seriousness in mind, roll into a match and just have fun...clobber a few enemies, get clobbered, make friends by hugging onto random people and spamming heart emotes or just trying to scheme up some weird random plan with an item you found and just wanna toy with the physics --- those days are GONE. Most every lobby is filled up with a mixture of bots and players and those FEW real players you'll get pitted against are commonly Player level 100's with dumptruck loads of hours played into the game and sole existence is to keep filling up their invisible win ratio/counter, they'll mop the floor with the lobbies and not give a flying F about your enjoyment/goofs as a new player. And there's a heap of toxic players who are going to throw the term ""Skill Issue"" or any measure of toxic slurs at you so be aware, even if people are telling you the game is fun/blast...just go in taking things with a grain of salt. 

That's my two fat cents though as a player with nearly 40 days worth of playtime (I probably would've been 70 days worth by now if I was able to stick more ardently to the game...buuut....it just became not worth it IMO)",2024-09-10 08:05:44,1,
comment,argee29,"Downloading deluxe edition rn, W or L?","If you want to goof around with no intention of winning, why do you care if others want to win? You can still goof around while others try to be competitive. It's not mutually exclusive. Heck, you can also be a nuissance to your party by not trying to win and just goof around. It's IS a competitive game because there are winners and losers. Simulation or RPG games are not competitive. Party Animals IS competitive!

Edit: NOT mutually exclusive",2024-09-11 06:35:07,1,
comment,TanukiB00ty,"Downloading deluxe edition rn, W or L?","""Party Animals IS competitive""

Wait...so you're telling me there's an actual leaderboard, ranked scene...tiers of ranks like in something like Overwatch for Party Animals or something?...cause as far as I'm concerned people playing balls to the wall with this game and then getting severely P.O'd to the point they'll start blaming their random teammates for ""Lack of skill"" or just outright turning hostile to the lobby for losing because ""Ya'll sold the game to that team"" is just legitimately a case of: Why are you getting so mad over a game where there's no real reward waiting at the end of this? 

Like I don't even wanna hear: B-but there's a victory photo and crown to be won! - The number of times I see these sweats that just demolish lobbies end up seemingly just taking their hands off their keyboards/controllers and just letting their character vibe check the camera with no even mild effort to play around with their partner in the victory circle or even make the ""Ha-ha funny photo moment!"" even REMOTELY funny lol. 

Tit for a tat I suppose, I personally just won't ever understand anyone bothering to stand and die on a hill for this game trying to consider it competitive with nothing actually tracking your win/loss ratio, just play it and have fun I'd say. Playing a party game and getting sweaty palms over it is very unbecoming and a waste of time in my opinion.",2024-09-11 07:56:48,0,
comment,argee29,"Downloading deluxe edition rn, W or L?","Why do you define competitive with stats? You can be competitive in a single random contestand may not require stats. If you play to goof around without trying to win, like jumping off the bridge, that's ""selling"" the game and it's annoying af for those trying to win it. I personally do not get mad for losing, but if you're not playing to win, why are you even playing this game? Go somewhere else where there's no losing and winning. Play single player games where you will not be a nuissance to others. Play roblox or something.",2024-09-11 08:25:59,1,
comment,TanukiB00ty,"Downloading deluxe edition rn, W or L?","Ah yes, and here comes the redundant regurgitated insults of ""Go play Fortnite"" or ""Go play Roblox""...lmao.

My simple point I'm getting across is: People who want to be competitive usually desire a ladder to climb, a reward a means to brag about it with visible proof to share with others. Party Animals legitimately was designed as a PARTY-GAME. Simply put it's meant for people to just gather around and have some laughs about it and just get some humor off it, You CAN play to win, perfectly valid strat and nobody is judging you for simply trying to win the game.

MY bottom line issue comes down to people having severely horrible attitudes about it and making the game miserable for everyone else who simply don't even desire to be involved, I'll never forget that one Icebreaker game where I legitimately had two freaking Red Pandas back in the Master Pass screaming like maniacs at each other ""Go kill yourself"" and blabbering and shouting top of their lungs like maniacs over this game because one wasn't helping the other win.

comment,TanukiB00ty,"Downloading deluxe edition rn, W or L?","""Up the wrong tree"" is the term you're looking for my friend.

I got it on Broken Arrow in Last Stand while going for a weekly challenge that required me to ""knock out 15 opponents with fish as a spectator"" I'm pretty sure both this challenge and the achievement are incorrect.

Just hit five people with spectator items, easiest way I found was to throw fish and knock people out. It takes a little practice to aim with it. Anytime you can get the coupon pawer id take it to help your chances of knocking someone out. More time to throw items = more chance to knock someone

And on top of it all half of these sweaty incels have a serious ego about this and insist on just staring at the victory camera not trying to make goofy photo moments and just declare either a simple ""GG""...OR, MORE likely...""EZ"".

comment,Cj_91a,Help me get Gordon nemo please! ( My friend ID is 3LJWJL),"I forgot if its a total of 4 or 5 rounds total...Leave the chain alone until I believe round 3..or 4..i forget. i havent played in a while.. There is almost no need for it. 1st round doesn't pull you enough to kill you. 2nd round does. But you can grab united the items so you don't get sucked in. On 3rd round i grabbed heavier/bulky items that still don't get sucked in. 4th i would grab chain...final end round is impossible to not get sucked in. It will kill your stamina as you hold onto the chain. However the point is to be the final person to fall into the hole. You got to always try and fall last but it's hard. I've seen people survive the final round before but it's mostly luck. 

Basically golden rule is don't waste stamina. Do not grab onto the items until the everything is about to rise and start moving. If you grab too early, your wasting stamina that goes down as you hold on.
If you see someone grabbing the chain early, feel free to knock them out before you grab something yourself. Half the time people are paying more attention to the dumb chain, rather than the time of the round ending.",2024-09-01 03:35:07,3,

If you're grabbing onto someone during the first blackhole, wait until the blackhole ends to try to knock them out so that when you land, you can throw them out.

comment,HarmlessTrash,Party animals Is dying,"There's a lot that happened in a very short span of time. A few patches ago, they removed something called the ""fling"" (heavy punch, jump, dropkick in succession to send your character flying) which was a beloved movement tech in the community. They did this by targeting successive inputs in a hope to stop macro abusing players. This also made it so waking up from knockouts took significantly longer. The devs' intention here was to stop macro abusers from insta-waking up. After community outrage, they brought back the fling but increased the stamina consumption on the combo to the point it's basically useless. Since then:

* Heavy punches consume more stamina 
* You now have to run for a set amount of time before you can initiate a heavy punch
* Hitboxes were changed in some way that made heavy punches useless and turned dropkicks into missiles that could knock multiple people out. It's nearly impossible to effectively heavy punch when you factor in the last change and this one
* Climbing speed has been changed for the worse

If you pop in their official Discord, check the feedback channel and you can see videos of people comparing the before and after. The game just feels god awful to play compared to how it used to a few months ago.",2024-08-30 02:19:53,3,

comment,NBC_with_ChrisHansen,Party animals Is dying,"Nearly every game ever released peaks at launch followed by a massive drop of active players shortly after. This is not only natural, but expected. So its just silly to try and make a comparison of numbers when you incorporate data from launch day. 

The active player base has been steady and healthy over the past 6 months with daily peaks of around 4k active players. There are expected spikes during events and when new content is released, and with lower expected averages during periods when no events are ongoing (like now). 

The game also has crossplay and those numbers only reflect active players on Steam. The actual number of players is much higher. And that number will certainly grow as the game becomes available on other platforms (such as PS5). 

There is nothing surprising about these numbers, and its certainly not evidence that the game is dying. It more suggests that a game made by a smaller dev studio is doing surprisingly well nearly a year after launch.",2024-08-30 04:08:03,5,

comment,WailmerFudge,Party animals Is dying,"I‚Äôm not surprised at all, biggest problem with keeping players is how long it takes them to add anything. I can‚Äôt even have fun playing casually anymore because there‚Äôs people queing up together and fixing games so their friends win. It‚Äôs just become a total waste of time even logging in. 

I liked what they added to the game but it feels way too late. The game got pushed to release too early with very little content and this is kind of the result. People waited for months for real updates and it took them almost a year to add half the content they promised. 

You can also add the fact that the skins are mostly bad and pretty much for free, for the most part. Players don‚Äôt want to wait three months for premium skins, outside of battlepasses. That and there‚Äôs no way they can sustain any success by not making or hardly making any money on a live service game. 

I hope PS5 will be a successful endeavor but I kind of doubt the game will be around much longer, unless it‚Äôs a massive hit there. They should‚Äôve never done an exclusive deal in the first place tbh. Their best option of staying open might be to get absorbed into epic and have a Fortnite collab.

Bridge has too many 3rd partiers. Anytime they see you knock someone out they go after you, even if the person knocked out has 2 wins and no one else has any. Then they don't throw anyone out. That and bots are too OP on bridge. They get cranked up to super hero level. They definitely read player controls too, as they respond to everything you do if they're locked onto you.

At least on broken arrow if you get 3rd partied it's funny. On bridge it's just frustrating.",2024-08-26 22:46:33,1,

comment,RARESH2005_,"@devs, give me more cookie skins to buy please.... or let me convert to bucks since i still need buck skins.....","Let me explain to you a bit more thoroughly. After reaching level 100 there‚Äôs no more advancement. You ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù and you get crates or whatever you want to call them. You can get cookies, ranging between 1500 and 5000, egg coins, ranging from 1 to 3 egg coins and you also get nemo bucks. I think I‚Äôve got at most 600 nemo bucks. But that happens very rarely. It‚Äôs like a 1 in 10 chance to get an egg coin and way way smaller chances to get nemo bucks. You can go weeks without getting nemo bucks. That‚Äôs really annoying. Especially when a cool skin is added to the shop and you need a lot of nemo bucks to get it. You better spend a couple of dollars because there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll get those money in time. Forgot to mention that you get to open about 3 crates. Maybe 4. Not sure.

submission,gthatch2,"Nemo Kart ideas (items, race tracks, and more)","Couple of ideas for the future of Nemo Kart. 

Items:
1. Boomerang: thrown forward and comes back as a repeat item. Usage 3 times. 
2. Ball Crossbow: Shoots 5 times, doesn‚Äôt cause a wreck but bumps/pushes enemies around. 
3. Plunger: acts like a slingshot, thrown it forward and then pulls you forward. If it hits an enemy it slows them down/pulls them back.. 
4. Plunger crossbow: shoots 5 times, when it hits enemies it sticks to them and slows them down. 
5. Invisibility potion: makes you invisible. 
6. Freeze gun: shoot forward. Temporarily makes an enemy an ice block. 

Kart Maps:
1. Lollipop Factory: race around the lollipop. Gummies act as obstacles in the course. 
2. Track and field: simple circular track that goes around either the soccer field or the football field. 

Last Stand Map:
1. Takes place on a platform above a road. Nemo Kart racers come driving through and can send players flying if they don‚Äôt get on the platform in time. Similar to wind tunnel.

Add anything that increases your stamina as well so you can roll for longer as well. There's just something so fun about rolling into a crowd of people fighting and watching them go flying in every direction. Steady stance just makes it so you're less likely to be knocked around in the ensuing collision. I also do like to add crash landing to this combination so I just roll up into someone to knock them towards a ledge and slam to send them flying off.

submission,WispyCiel,Red vision in Smash mode?,"Hello! I have a question.

Today when doing a run of Smash to do my dailies for the event.. I had a weird moment where my vision in the game was some kind of reddish hue and my character slumped over and died despite not being attacked at that moment.

Certainly never experienced that one before. ü§î It was during the ice level if that helps any. Part of me wondered if it was stamina related but.. I never had this happened before so maybe it's a ""pawer""?

I tried looking up about it to see the list of pawers and what could make that happen and found no answers. So I thought maybe you guys would know since there's knowledgeable players on here.

If anyone could help me put together this puzzle that would be great. Just trying to understand what happened lol.

Thanks so much!",2024-08-18 21:04:24,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1evjxm6/red_vision_in_smash_mode/

I should be able to recover and try to get back up but it's so god damned rare that I can't stand this level. But yet there's that rare occasion where I morphed into a roach and can get back up multiple times. Why is that? What the heck is wrong with this game and how that crap works?

Any tips aside from the obvious (skill issue, don't go in the ditch then, etc etc BS) would be appreciated.",2024-08-14 07:45:33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1ervphf/tips_on_ichiban/
comment,TrueEvil_,Tips on Ichiban?,"You have a hidden HP stat. Getting hit reduces your HP, and getting hit in certain ways in certain places takes a LOT more HP than others. The gas quickly drains your HP as well, so if you took a nasty hit or two before being tossed in, you're going to die really fast. Alternatively, if you didn't receive much of a beating before falling in the gas, you'll last for a few seconds.",2024-08-14 07:48:10,6,
comment,WispyCiel,Tips on Ichiban?,"Hm. I guess next time I'm set up in it I'll try to pay more attention to how much I get hit prior to landing in the poison. Part of me wondered if it was a stamina thing.. though a lack thereof is also annoying in those situations since you can't save yourself.

This hidden HP thing sure is an infuriating feature.",2024-08-14 07:52:37,1,
comment,TrueEvil_,Tips on Ichiban?,"It's important to note is that it's a somewhat inconsistent feature. You can make a good guess on how much damage you take from a given hit, but you'll frequently get weird anomalies in both directions.",2024-08-14 08:00:54,1,
comment,PixlPixii,Tips on Ichiban?,"There are also a few places you can stand early game to avoid being in the poison. The broken sections on the left and right allow you to stand on the debris without killing you. 

A good strategy for eliminating other players too would be to spin them in a circle before throwing them to make them fly further. You can throw them out of bounds if they go between the entrance area at the front of the stage in the ditch.

Throwing the bricks you find under the ox statues can also knock out enemies if you hit them.

Also be careful when climbing back up along the far right corner because the wall can crumble on you and cause you to fall back into the gas.

Even when you are knocked out you can still help by throwing items but you should be aware of the slopes of the floor because they can cause your bombs to roll or stay exactly in place where they land.

Those are all the random tips I can think of that you might find useful. As for getting up quicker after being knocked out I just spam the punch button while holding the run trigger. 

I'm not positive, but I think the name tag above your head will fill up quicker to indicate how close you are to waking up. It's very subtle, but you'll notice the name tag appears to fill up with some kind of liquid.",2024-08-14 08:09:09,5,

comment,TrueEvil_,Tips on Ichiban?,"So, I opened the game to test it. I was going to drain my stamina and then bomb myself to see how it lined up with the wakeup period. Bomb knockouts are pretty short, and doing a fling puts a HUGE delay on your stamina regen, so it was gonna be a pretty easy test.

I then promptly remembered 3 seconds in that you can watch the nametag drain in real-time as you expend your stamina. And it refills as you regen stamina. It also doesn't empty itself when you get knocked out.

Would be nice if it were indeed a wakeup indicator.",2024-08-14 08:27:17,1,
comment,NobleRook500,Tips on Ichiban?,"I like the map but not how fast the gas kills me. I can barely revive before it gets me. 

Idk how people hit and kick so hard. They can knock others completely across the map while half my hits and kicks barely phase them if at all. 

I can't pick them up, spin and throw them either like they do me. They wake up so quickly and knock me out.  

I need training lol.",2024-08-20 09:35:53,2,
comment,TrueEvil_,Tips on Ichiban?,"As far as general tips for the level:

- You only take damage from the gas in the pit if you're on the ground or within like an inch of it. You can stand or land on some rocks down there and be completely fine. You can even stand on the concrete ridge at the base of the main arena and avoid death. You can use that to reposition if someone is trying to edgeguard you.

- You can climb up the high side-walls towards the back of the arena to avoid getting hit by players or spectators while you climb back on. In other words, you can climb up the walls in the far corners of the pit.

- If someone is holding on to the side to avoid being edgeguarded, you can gently toss a brick over the side to hit them on the head and knock them into the gas.",2024-08-14 08:10:07,1,

It was sweet, but kinda' funny because it wasn't a big deal to our team but he just sounded so sorry about it.",2024-08-12 21:44:37,2,
comment,Dodge8182,I can't believe I survived this.,yeah the teammates you get in this game is a real hit or miss sometimes you get someone is the literal definition of evil and other times you get the nicest person you've ever met. that kid definitely seems like a genuinely good hearted human - of which the game needs more,2024-08-12 21:46:53,1,
comment,PixlPixii,I can't believe I survived this.,"I agree. It's kinda' shocking to me just how toxic the players of this game can get. I know it's a competitive game and all, but it's also a party game with cute fluffy animals so it's wild to me that it would even appeal to people like those edgy teenagers from before.

I've experienced less toxicity playing GTA Online back in the day than I ever experienced in Party Animals. Not to say I haven't run into very toxic players in GTA, but I've never had someone throw a game to attack one of their teammates before. You'd think if they cared about winning that would take priority but I guess not.",2024-08-12 21:51:44,2,

I've read several posts, I've asked friends, I've just tried random things... I can't succeed in any facet in this game. People knock me out and I'm out for 10,000 years. I spam every button available to me, I do what people say online, I've tried pressing buttons that don't actually do anything in hopes they might, but I can't break free from grabs. I can't throw anyone either. The controls say to press right click to throw but it does nothing. I've tried pressing it. I've tried holding it and letting go. I've tried spamming it. It just will not throw people. If I even get the time to do so. Which is another problem. People break out of my grab in less than half a second, 90% of the time. I don't understand how they do it because I can't break out of anything.

If you let go too early, they don't get thrown. if you let go too late, they're almost above your head, and they'll just drop when you let go. Get that sweet spot when you're still in the middle of the lift.

comment,redditnoob_threeve,Failing Upwards vs Failing,"When ready to get back up, run the opposite direction of the main conveyor belt, then run back and drop kick. It's a physics game. Example: you're on the right side. Sprint right, then sprint back left and drop kick. Of course, keep running forward too or you'll just be rolled off.

As for the bombs, if you see one land and about to explode, do a roll. While in a roll, you have a small frame of invincibility. So if a bomb lands in front of you, just try to roll in front of it so it's behind you. If it blows up mid roll, you'll just be launched forward. If it knocks you out, at least you have some time it recover.

These are all tips for conveyor but the rolling is in general. Also, if you get blown up by a bomb, you're knocked out for a much shorter time than if you were hit  by the bomb itself or if someone hit you.",2024-08-11 19:08:39,1,

submission,Obiwandkinobee,Thoughts....,"1. Contact is a little u forgiving when other players tap you - which can slow you down enough to go from 2nd to 7th. The degree to which you slow down is a bit too much.

2. 1st Place Seeker drone - There needs to be a way for players to avoid them without having a bubble.  If that means timing it right and pressing a button - so be it.  I saw a kid get tapped twice in a row by seekers....very unfortunate.

3. Hitting the walls slows down players too much.  More effective if players just bounce off.  I understand the grass slowing you down.

4. Button Remapping for just that Game mode.  LT is usually never Gas.  RT for example has always been the go to on controller.

Overall I give it a solid 7/10 for the Beta Experience.",2024-08-07 22:19:17,27,https://i.redd.it/3rntf8a9hbhd1.png

comment,longcat3991,Thoughts....,"> They should all have unique stats other than just speed

They do. There's *at least* max speed, weight and handling that differs between them. Seeing how much they copied Mario Kart, there are probably also hidden acceleration, mini-turbo and offroad stats. Some karts also have additional unique features which you can [check out in the kart selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0JhAxsxR6M)",2024-08-08 11:10:33,2,

The drift behaviour is also very different, with for example the trolley being very stiff and the puppy being super responsive.

Wait long enough and everyone will have a whole wardrobe available, patience is a virtue after all...and I think Recreate just prefers to give skins to the more popular animals in most regards...most of the animals you named are hardly ever picked or played. I can't recall the last time I've seen a Moon Moon, let alone a Curtis or Yurasa (Which honestly Yurasa is a fan/community concept so he might not see skins, you can't expect skins for Kato or Kiko either in those regards, or even major IPs like Om Nom, Lamb or Ori/Naru.)   
  
End of the day though, they're JUST skins that don't alter the game at all and don't give any kinda advantages so I'm not even sure why people are so bothered about one mini-patch involving bunnies getting cosmetics =/

comment,SPJess,Does anyone genuinely enjoy winter is coming? ,"I haven't played in a while but I was one of the people voting for that map üòÖ 

Allow me to explain. In the early parts of the game you have a big ol area to run around in. Some people will try to follow you and that's just funny sometimes. 

The idea of being a Popsicle then being thawed by the fire is just a really neat mechanic. (If that's any indication in how long it's been since I played) 

I tended to stay away from the crowds that were constantly bombing each, learned to aim my dive kick and just always had fun playing that one. 

I don't hate it. But friggin Broken Arrow ticks me off when it gets picked. 

Ik Broken Arrow is considered a good map, I just hate it. Like I'd rather play the arcade fight thing .. where you're playing a  game on a big wall while everyone is fighting for the control stick than Broken Arrow.",2024-08-06 05:26:59,2,

submission,HappiestDayTale,"A petty post about something [Warning, very petty I think]","**Downvote this post if you want, I honestly dont care about upvotes or downvotes**, but I want to just say that can we not do things like roleplay or whatever the people I'm about to talk about was doing? I'm not against roleplaying, I used to do it (I'm cringe I guess because of that-), and I still do, but just less. Anyways, while I was playing the dark castle level, there were these 3 bunnies (which I wont name) that kept roleplaying and whatnot. 2 of them had the same skin, and one of them had that baby diaper and choo choo skin. Whenever someone tried to get close to one of them, or tried to attack one of them, they just went full force trying as hard as they could to eliminate you. Normally I would'nt care about someone doing that, but they kept acting all corny and using the corniest emote things over and over again. At one point just the 3 of them were left, and everyone had to suffer watching them do the heart emotes to each other, and then they all jumped off at the same time. I probably would've been less annoyed and acted less petty about this if everything wasnt so hot right now, and if I didnt get so anxious from trying so hard to win, when winning doesnt really matter tbh. Anyways anyways, the 2 bunnies that were the same skin had nametags/gamertags (idk what they're called) that were the same name (I think)...

and i definitely agree about the time between rounds (especially in smash, those games take *forever*) and the tasks needing some tweaking. all we can do is hope they listen to player feedback and make better changes than they have been lately. if you haven't already, you should definitely join the discord and put down your thoughts in the feedback channel. :)",2024-08-03 21:55:30,2,

submission,Hjaaal,Probability of contents in mystery boxes,"Hey guys,

I tracked the contents of 212 mystery boxes, so you dont have to.From level 100 onwards you can get a maximum of 3 mystery boxes per day when you play.

There are 3 different types of items you can get: Cookies, Egg Coins and Nemo Bucks. Each item has 3 variations:

* Cookies: 1500, 2500, 5000
* Egg Coins: 1, 2, 3
* Nemo Bucks: 200, 400, 600

The chances of getting any amount of these items are as follows:

**Cookies (131) 61,8%**

**Egg Coins (59) 27,8%**

**Nemo Bucks (22) 10,4%**

https://preview.redd.it/nz4a67yiwifd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b692b6adec06291f426fc002c889b83b0e97b95e

**Cookies**

I opened 131 boxes containing Cookies, **totaling 308k,** or \*\*2351 / box.\*\*The chances of a cookie box containing 1,5k cookies are the highest at 55% (72), followed by 2,5k cookies at 29% (38) and 5k cookies at 16% (21).

**Egg Coins**

I opened 59 boxes containing Egg Coins, **totaling 97,** or \*\*1,64 / box.\*\*The chances of an egg coin box containing 1 Egg Coin are the highest at 54,2% (32), followed by 2 Egg Coins at 27,1% (16) and 3 Egg Coins at 18,6% (11).

**Nemo Bucks**

I opened 22 boxes containing Nemo Bucks, **totaling 6200,** or \*\*282 / box.\*\*The chances of a nemo bucks box containing 200 Nemo Bucks are the highest at 68,2% (15), followed by 400 Nemo Bucks at 22,7% (5) and 600 Nemo Bucks at 9,1% (2).

**Every box is worth 1453 Cookies, 0,46 Egg Coins and 29,3 Nemo Bucks**

**The overall probabilities when opening a Mystery Box:**

* **Probability of getting 1.5k cookies:** 34,1%
* **Probability of getting 2.5k cookies:** 17,9%
* **Probability of getting 5k cookies:** 10%
* **Probability of getting 1 Egg Coin:** 15,1%
* **Probability of getting 2 Egg Coins:** 7,5%
* **Probability of getting 3 Egg Coins:** 5,2%
* **Probability of getting 200 Nemo Bucks:** 7,1%
* **Probability of getting 400 Nemo Bucks:** 2,4%
* **Probability of getting 600 Nemo Bucks:** 0,9%

For each category (Cookies, Egg Coins, Nemo Bucks), there is a dominant outcome with the highest probability, which means these outcomes are most frequently encountered. The probabilities decline as the quantity increases within each category, indicating that larger quantities are rarer.

The reward system in this game is not entirely random. The observed probabilities indicate a structured approach to distributing rewards, likely designed to balance player motivation and engagement.

I thought these stats were pretty cool. I hope you did too.",2024-07-29 21:46:59,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1efbxi9/probability_of_contents_in_mystery_boxes/

comment,TanukiB00ty,Jump Kick ,"I mean I find the Dropkick should be a REAL hard hitting move given it's kinda high risk on most maps where you can go flinging yourself into the water or a death hazard...so it feels a little justified to make it do some heavy knockback (Not to mention just feels more realistic...you're throwing your entire body into a double foot propelled kick as a rather pudgy animal...feels legit like what the weight would do to you on impact.) 

I've honestly not noticed the Heavy Punch change, I feel like it's a bit slower but it ALSO packs much more wallop when I've landed it...like that clip I posted a while back was a heavy punch and it launched the literal doggo over the second wall in Ichiban. I feel like Recreate wants to just make these moves more impactful when you actually time and land them opposed to people just chasing each other's tails spinning circles back to back spamming heavy punches hoping one will slip up and knock the other out XD",2024-07-30 03:33:00,2,

submission,North-Ad-4616,Mental Health Boost,"So, I‚Äôm just here to say how dope this game is. There are a few things here and there that bug me, but overall, this game is amazing. The amount of laughing I do when I play is insane, and even when I get on and trash talk in the game chat from time to time, hopefully it‚Äôs obvious that I‚Äôm just joking and it‚Äôs all in good fun. 

I‚Äôm a PhD student, I battle severe depression, and life can get really gloomy sometimes. This game‚Äî stupid as it may sound ‚Äî has saved me from a lot of really dark days. The emojis, the ridiculous names, the trash talk from players in game chat from time to time where people, in my experience, have always been hilarious, are really cool experiences. 

Like, people curse,(as do I, admittedly) but there is something inherently hilarious about hearing another person yell ‚Äúput me down, you tiger f-ck‚Äù that is just so unserious that I could never really be mad. The only time that I take offense is when people have racist/predatory names, and then me and my buddy usually alert the map, we ban together and toss that person off, usually accompanied by a ‚ÄúGET OFF THIS B*TCH,‚Äù and then continue playing. 

It‚Äôs such a cool game. I hope it doesn‚Äôt go the way of KO City or Rumbleverse where even though there‚Äôs a loyal following, the game becomes too expensive to run the servers and has to shut down. 


Anyways. Just wanted to thank all of you for being insanely competitive via stuffed animals. May none of you ever throw me off a map ever again.

That and people just grabbing two-hand weapons and politely just standing at the top to greet you over and over again at Icebreakers or Ichiban or whatever, honestly none of the quality of life changes have helped the game at all, just made it severely more clunky and laggy in bursts randomly for most people I talk to. 

I think in all brutal honesty this'll be the worst pass I've had to play on the game with the state it's in, You just pray to the RNG gods that you don't get rubber-banded off an edge randomly while you were just going for a casual walk/reposition towards a weapon near said death ledge/hazard.",2024-07-28 03:08:29,1,

The people who preach that we shouldn't complain about the game because it's just a party game are often the quickest to complain when a mechanic doesn't suit them. It's almost as if they have a special privilege to be unhappy.

submission,Skarlex,FACE/OFF needs to be removed,"Seriously that pawer is the reason i don't play smash mode anymore , it's so annoying that by round 3 or 4 , half the lobby looks like your teammate, and if you don't have a mic you're guaranteed to knock your teammate by mistake over and over, and him doing the same. The only way i see it balanced is if the buff is completely removed the first time you get knocked each round.

comment,PixlPixii,FACE/OFF needs to be removed,"One trick I use that might benefit others is to pay attention to which pawers your teammate has. I noticed someone who looked like they were on my team would spawn with a two handed weapon each round despite my teammate not having that pawer activated. I've also noticed a different time my teammate had the crash landing pawer so when I saw them use it I knew the other player wasn't on my team.

As for FACE/OFF, I don't really understand the power at all...I rarely see people in my lobbies use it and when I DO choose it out of curiosity I have zero clue who tf I'm disguised as so I remotely just find it to be a waste of a pick when you can't do any funny shenanigans like the Spy class from TF2.

However, I posted ONE video/link of the game in video tags, in fairness It's not really any different than clips being posted other than the fact it's a youtube video and edited for fun. I could say people post clips on here to gather a few karma points and click, no?

Just seems to be a bit of a joke to share something that was funny and to feel apart of the community only to be shunned away by reddit mods. I never excessively spammed this and it was never to just gather clicks etc. IT was to feel apart of the community and share a loved project with everyone.

submission,c4ntTh1nk0f_aU5er,"The gameplay doesnt feel the same after the update, and I dont like it","So i'm aware of the changes in the climbing being made faster, but another change I noticed is how everyone is all of a sudden a dropkicking pro? 

Dropkicks have more accuracy and the hits are more devastating than they used to be. Its like everyone has dropkicking aimbot including myself. I feel like the hitboxes are off in some way. Winning in maps such as ice breaker has become impossible due to the fact that a single dropkick from a person will launch me 50 meters away into the ocean. It doesnt feel the same as before.

You cant just expect new players to be on the same level of skill as experienced players. Even if you buff everything, it wont help them or give them a better chance against the players that already know how to aim and to abuse the buffed dropkick.

comment,Various-Push-1689,Is there a chance this game could suffer the same fate as fall guys?,I highly doubt it. Maybe way later in the future but definitely not as fast. Party animals has more to it than fall guys. Especially since they are adding new game modes and things to do. All you really do in fall guys is stay alive. Don‚Äôt get hit by the moving object or fall off the platform and make it to the finish line or simply stay alive. There‚Äôs a few teamwork maps but it‚Äôs still pretty basic and repetitive imo. It also requires more players to match make,2024-07-24 06:27:36,8,
comment,Berzerk06,Is there a chance this game could suffer the same fate as fall guys?,"Always possible. The dev team for this game seems pretty small, and the game is approaching the 1yr anniversary. I didn't play fall guys pre-f2p but have played it since and it's been a rough ride, I wouldn't wish the same for party animals.

I could see them using the new racing mode to experiment with more racing maps or obstacle courses without vehicles.",2024-07-24 06:07:19,3,
comment,N7xDante,Is there a chance this game could suffer the same fate as fall guys?,"I played F2P fall guys for a year straight.

Honestly all the game needs is a better map introduction system. When they went to epic they changed map releases to community maps, and it just absolutely destroyed the game 

All you gotta do is introduce new maps and it‚Äôll keep people interested.",2024-07-24 15:15:16,2,
comment,jitlimmy,Is there a chance this game could suffer the same fate as fall guys?,"This game holds significant potential, especially with the recent addition of Nemo Kart. Enhanced polish and new maps will undoubtedly make it a standout feature. The inclusion of the Paws card game in the main menu would be a welcome addition; with some refinement and an improved UI, Paws could seamlessly integrate and stand out. Considering the negative reviews for UNO on Xbox, Paws could fill that void effectively.

Additionally, the developers could explore introducing a Trivial Pursuit-style quiz show game mode, drawing inspiration from popular titles like Among Us, Mario Party, and Jackbox. By incorporating diverse game modes, they can ensure the game remains engaging and full of variety. With these enhancements, the game has the potential to solidify its position as a top-tier multiplatform party game.",2024-07-24 10:29:49,2,

Eh, I think it all depends on the community.

Fall Guys kept a rather positive following when it was non F2P and then got a boom of popularity when it went F2P and held that for a while...then they sorta just shot themselves in the foot then procedurally up to their kneecaps as they just kept ignoring their majority players that didn't enjoy a lot of the changes.

Party Animals IMO overall seems to be suffering a bit of a tedious see-saw of updates that suddenly pop up and make people just grind out for a heap of skins, then people will cash it out and roll back off for several months until they choose to pop another battle pass or new interesting updates, Honestly it's not a good sign when a majority of the people I speak with on the Discord public chat rooms and even my own personal circle of friends outright say the game is just unpleasant to play most times.

Everyone claims they wanna just play the game and have fun in the main game modes, but get incessantly bullied by people who get bruised egos easily by one K.O and they proceed to just keep them out of the game by scummy tactics or targeting relentlessly, followed by typically just a lot of emote spams and a heap of text chat banters/DM harassments...and given it grows more and more frequent with each passing update/month in the game I know of at least dozens of people who outright say they just put the game down and don't even bother bringing their friends around to it anymore.

Party Animals has an attitude issue in the community besides a sluggish and sloppy updates/events road map. It's one of those many situations of: A beautiful concept on paper, but in practice it's absolutely horrid when you add in the crucial elements of multiplayer and people out to ruin the game.",2024-07-25 02:46:31,2,

comment,Various-Push-1689,What is this game ment to be?,"It‚Äôs like gang beats turned into an ultimate party game with more to come. 3 different quick match game modes all pretty fun and are online only. 

There‚Äôs also 3-4 short story type missions you can do by yourself. But you can also do custom matches with any of the maps and game modes and either invite friends or make it public so randoms can join. You can change all the empty slots into bots and set their difficulty to play by yourself. And trust me the bots on the highest difficulty are almost more challenging than fighting actual playersüòÇ

There‚Äôs also a cabin map on the custom mode where you can basically hangout with randoms or just your friends and play uno or ride around outside in the snow on sleds. Or just destroy the map like most people doü§£

submission,gthatch2,Additional Challenges Idea(s),"I‚Äôd love to see them add additional challenges beyond the weekly ones. Similar to the achievement/trophy ones we have now, but more of them. Give us a challenge tab and award us bones, gears, or rarely outfits. 

Some ideas I‚Äôve had:

General style:
1. Play/Win X times on each map.
2. Play/Win X times as (feline, canine, flying, land, water). 
3. Play/Win X times as each specific character (awards outfit). 
4. Knock out X times with each weapon. 
5. Play/Win X times with the different kart types. 
6. Get knocked out X number of times but recover. 

Specific style:
1. Carry the lantern for a total of 5 minutes across Castle matches. ‚ÄúTorch Barer‚Äù
2. Survive swimming for a total of 5 minutes as a water animal. ‚ÄúSea Beast‚Äù
3. Drop Kick an enemy off the map X times. ‚ÄúThis is Sparta‚Äù

The list could go on and on. Really thinking something to work towards that isn‚Äôt a huge burden. 

Any other thoughts?

submission,CrazedGamer00,Map concept sketches,"Quickly came up with three maps during some gameplay last night. 

Sandcastle contest pretty straight forward, you ‚Äòcollect‚Äô buckets of wet sand to bring back to build sand castles. Major obstacle is the water, small waves flow up into the collection zone and every handful of seconds that will wash everyone out to see who gets caught. A lifeguard NPC will throw life preservers at anyone in the water as an added challenge. 

Similar to the train and arcade maps, the more sand you collect the bigger the castle the better chance at winning. 

Orchard; you collect fruit to get points. There are trees that drop fruit and bins to put said fruit in. The map is divided by a fence that can be climbed or destroyed. Opens up the possibility for classic sabotage. Steal other teams fruits or prevent them from collecting.

Feels like it‚Äôs missing a main obstacle though.

The mine; similar to the orchard, you collect Ores to gain points to win. This map however varies in elevation, the main obstacle here is a giant hole/chasm in the middle of the ore veins area. On either side of the hole is a constantly spinning pulley elevator, one side goes up, the other down. You grab the ore, go up the elevator, then place the ore in a mine cart that will pass by every few seconds very slowly. 

These are very rough sketches, I‚Äôm not an artist nor am I a level designer. This was intended as a fun little concept in hopes to promote discussion or other ideas. I will of course accept any criticism on my ideas, im just hoping a dev sees this and maybe it inspires something in them.  ",2024-07-23 03:02:23,10,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1e9xcea

Also, the Titanic is sinking in the water past the ice burgs in Ice Breaker, the Nemo and Machiatto couple sitting on the bench watching the sailboat beyond the goal in Beast Football have no eyes (kind of creepy), Castleween, appears to actually be an old-style prison with an external walkway that has security camera and task lighting, there are multiple gator heads and a spine surrounding the main gator that the bridge and water falls from in Gator Valley. Also, there are only six showers in the character selection room/gym which means at least a few of our animals have to share the soap before and after a match, and the egg slot machine has small cat ears on top which is cute,but even more confusing with regards to dropping eggs.",2024-07-22 06:28:23,3,

 - the Titanic is sinking in the background of Ice Breaker  
 - there are two human copilots helping Underbite fly the plane in Broken Arrow  
 - there are a few small gator caves in Gator Valley, not just the one gator mouth that the water and bridge come out of

comment,JustYourCommonMarz,My impressions on Nemo Kart,"Agreed, however for me i struggle with finding lobbies with actual good players. Also, the controls are very uncomfortable for me. it gets boring reasonably quick too because of the only 1 map, and i alos think the karts are dumb. I like them having different stats like mario kart, but instead of cars just being better, I think they need to have a trade off. Sure, a car can be faster but then make it have a worse drift or something. As it is right now, the more you play the more advantage you have basically. i dont think its a very good system.

  
Even tho those were all negative however, I really like the mode too and think its a breath of fresh air. It just needs some adjustments which makes sense, it is in beta afterall. hopefully they listen to the community and make the game as best as it can be! im also hoping when it comes out of beta we get a new map for it",2024-07-22 00:49:34,1,

submission,gabepleasee,üìù Patch Notes 1.7.0.0,"# Version 1.7.0.0 (2024.7.20)

Ladies and gentlemen, cats and dogs, please allow me to introduce you to: **Nemo Kart (Beta)**

>Nemo Kart is a brand new attempt by our development team, where players can choose their own animal and uniquely styled vehicles to compete on the track. Currently, the kart mode features a meticulously designed track. This track incorporates various challenges aimed at testing players' driving skills and strategic use.

Players can choose from different styles of karts, each with unique performance and design. Some karts have better cornering abilities, some earn higher acceleration bonuses from gear boosts, and others have stronger off-road capabilities.

By participating in Nemo Kart mode races, players can earn a game currency called ""gears"". These gears can be used to unlock new karts and special paint jobs. Each kart has several different paint options that not only change the vehicle's appearance but also reflect different racing personalities, such as being more aggressive or conservative.

Players can join Nemo Kart mode through quick match or custom games, currently accommodating up to 8 players or AI.

**Beta Phase Notes**: *Since the Nemo Kart mode is currently in the Beta testing phase, we are actively collecting player feedback to optimize vehicle balance and performance on specific hardware. We encourage players to report any issues or suggestions they encounter during their experience.*

üèñÔ∏è Content Update

The summer heat brings the animals to the beach. From July 20 to August 24, all players can receive a free Summer Pass. By completing challenges, players can level up the Summer Pass and unlock summer-themed outfits and more!

üîã Optimizations

1. Optimized the matchmaking algorithm
2. Improved the AFK player detection to reduce the impact of passive behavior on the game experience
3. Adjusted the difficulty of the Cast Away mission
4. Improved the wall-climbing experience

üõ†Ô∏è Bug FIxes

1. Fixed an issue in SMASH where using FACE/OFF and Camouflage skills simultaneously under certain circumstances caused the character to remain invisible
2. Fixed an issue in SMASH where bombs thrown in the Ichiban map after using the Magnified Boom did not have explosion effects
3. Fixed an issue in Quick Match Classic mode where the spectator view couldn't be switched in ball games
4. Fixed an issue in Quick Match Classic mode where if a real player left during the voting phase, it caused an imbalance in team sizes

ü•ä Adjustments on Combo Moves

1. Restored the use of some combo skills but significantly increased the stamina required for their use
2. Further restricted certain combo buttons

Really sad. Devs don't even seem to acknowledge that many players are upset either. If they dont change any of it, I really think its just over for me with this game.

  
Smash as a gamemode is fun the first few times you play it, but if you have seen all the power ups it just becomes kinda tedious to play. It takes forever because of the long loading times between each round and the gamemode is super unbalnced, the first few rounds basically don't matter at all since the point system makes no sense...",2024-07-19 02:21:33,3,

submission,lone__wolfieee,Black Sails beast mode achievement,"Hey guys, I'm here to post a quick guide on how to complete this achievement.

You're best doing this with someone who's a team player or someone you get along with, as it can be quite difficult. One of you needs to stand where the ads jump on, on top of the banister next to the cannon. This makes the ads focus on you without yourself getting knocked out if you're careful, whilst your team mate headbutts the ads and throws them off. You should always jump down when it time to shoot the pirate ship, as it can completely knock you off the ship. Make sure you jump back on the banister after each round of shooting. You should also help shooting the Kraken once all ads have been thrown over board. On the last set of ads, make sure your team mate focuses on knocking out those ads with the crossbows first, as this can knock you completely off the banister and knocking you out. Your teammate should also be aware of bombs, and making sure to throw them to the pirate ship. Do not jump down unless your team mate gets knocked by ads and the ads start to focus on them, rather than you.

I hope this helps!",2024-07-18 21:43:21,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1e6n25c/black_sails_beast_mode_achievement/

Even spamming the buttons you still stay down for like 6-7 seconds. I noticed it immediately when going playing to get enough Nemo bucks to buy the new M.I.B. skins.,2024-07-17 23:27:24,7,
comment,TrueEvil_,HUH,"I'm not gonna say that you or anyone else is wrong, but people say this or something similar every single patch, and never do I feel the difference. Nor have I seen any other seriously good players comment on it either. 

Tangent time: take everything said here with an entire shaker of salt. My personal crackhead conspiracy theory is that, on average, lesser skilled players are given an additional incoming & outgoing damage advantage. The players that have problems with stuff like ""knockout duration"", ""physics"", and ""hitreg"" are usually the ones approaching level 100 or recently hit it. I suspect that they got good enough for the game to stop giving them that extra leniency, which coincided with the time the patch dropped. They don't hit as hard anymore and they're down for longer, and they understandably blame the patch. And so every patch, we have the same complaints.

I was that player once, actually, back in September or so. Was level 90 or so, hitting my stride in terms of consistency. A patch drops, and bang, everything felt wrong. I blamed the patch that had dropped the day before. Others reported no change at all. Ever since, I've seen my exact feelings and confusion about this situation expressed by a lot of players; usually by those with a similar level of skill/experience as I possessed at the time. Not by players better than that.

Playing against newer players, at least in my experience, also points towards the existence of this system. It's always the new guys that will randomly one-bang you with a light punch and put you down for 3 business days. That doesn't happen against 300hr players. Almost all of my weird, ""how the fuck is that fair"" moments happen against really inexperienced players. 

The game also has had the power to individually control the incoming/outgoing damage of individual players since launch: this is what the bot difficulty adjusts. Not their intelligence or ability. Simply just how hard they hit, and how much they resist your hits. It could just as easily be applied to players in a real game.

Anyways, I just wanted to give my super long-winded theory as to why you and others might be experiencing gameplay changes. I'm no way asserting this to be certainly true, and if you think I'm wrong, that's entirely fair. But it's food for thought.",2024-07-17 23:52:47,-5,
comment,PixlPixii,HUH,"I'm not sure what exactly is causing it. I just noticed that when playing the day before the update the knockout times on average for me didn't feel as long as they did playing the day after the patch. I've been level 100 for a long time now so it isn't anything related to my level or my hours played either. 

My guess was that they made some changes to combat the people who would get up immediately after being knocked out by using macros as the changelog does mention something about this without going into specifics as to what they mean. 

We know that the fling was patched out which could be what they're referring to but it says that more than one exploit involving macros was removed so it's really unclear. I've not taken note of which rank players are knocking me out when I stay down for much longer, but I have seen it happening to players in general in the entire lobby. It's not just ""I stay down for so long and others don't"" this is something I've noticed happening to everyone whenever I was playing after the update.

I believe other long time players on the forums with well over 300 hours playtime have been making similar claims about the knockout duration feeling different. That's just my own personal observations though. I haven't done any testing, but it did immediately stand out to me as an issue I hadn't experienced before.",2024-07-18 00:07:03,3,
comment,TrueEvil_,HUH,"Fair enough. I've played quite a few hours since the patch dropped, and while I haven't noticed any change for either myself or my opponents, that's not enough to make any definitive claim about the state of the game. This game has some serious issues with consistency, so it's not surprising that players' experiences have been very different.",2024-07-18 00:19:10,1,
comment,beta1111,HUH,"I, too, have definitely noticed a longer wakeup duration from KO. At first I thought maybe the other player had very high stamina, etc, but as I played more with different players, I'd noticed the same issue. I have, however, just discovered by smashing punch and jump button repeatedly, I would wake up faster. I've only tried it a few times so far, so please go ahead and try and report back if you've noticed the same result.",2024-07-18 20:21:14,2,

comment,RARESH2005_,Why does everyone pick Typhoon so much!?,"Dude. You don‚Äôt need to spam. Are you dumb in the head? Xbox for computer? Yes, you can‚Äôt use pc game pass to play party animals natively. It‚Äôs only available on steam unlike other game pass games. Yes you can play it using xcloud. 

When you‚Äôre saying that Xbox players can‚Äôt play the game natively, you‚Äôre talking about XBOX CONSOLE users. Not PC GAME PASS users. What you‚Äôre talking about is GAME PASS, not XBOX. Party animals denied using game pass to play their game on pc. They‚Äôve only allowed it for steam users. And that‚Äôs that. What you‚Äôre using is called XCLOUD and it works poorly if you‚Äôre internet connection is very bad. You can use that on any device with an internet connection and a browser.

comment,redditnoob_threeve,I was in tears,"AI bots. When they have no logical path to an opponent, they pace back and forth. Then when they see one after a while they tend to do a jump kick. Since they're using the same logic they do the same things. You can study their behavior if you go to a customs match with only bots and hide somewhere they can't easily reach, like you did on the back there. They'll probably pace and then mob up, all trying to walk the same path at the same time. 

Other than knowing their behaviors, you can usually tell it's a bot by their exp. Usually a nice round number that ends in a 0. 10000 exp is the most common, no matter the level, but I've seen others like 1250, 2500, and I think 6500 or 7500. While players can hit these kinds of numbers, it's not extremely common. If you can catch it, their logo icon also takes a second to load when you first load the player info from the pause menu. All those things combined can pretty much identify a bot.",2024-07-17 21:46:52,2,

submission,jitlimmy,Black Sails on Beast Mode Difficulty (Cheese 2.0),"After seeing a previously patched method to beat Black Sails on Beast Mode, I figured out a new way to do it. It's a bit different and requires some extra work.

It will work with AI as a teammate but you'll need to jump down for the cannon, Kraken battle and to throw bombs back, took me a few tries but I can confirm this way is possible, best to do it with a friend though.

I hope this helps anyone trying to do it, happy to answer any questions, get this done while it's possible.

submission,None,Adjustments to gameplay/Flinging & Superman Punch Removal.,"*For someone who's played Party Animals for over the last 10 months, spending hundreds of hours on a game that caught my eye and attention- It very well seems that a lot of the community (Even myself) are not happy with recent changes made to the overall QOL and core gameplay. Many may see the discourse/distaste in these changes as ""Annoying"" ""Irritating"" or the idea that many are ""Crying"" what is over a ""Kids Game"". I just want to make something clear: I understand both sides of the community.*

-

-

**There are many people who genuinely don't see this current update as a problem. Going about their everyday Animal Shenanigans and playing the game at a comfortable level. Not batting an eye, or minding much of how the game is slowly but surely progressing, as we near PA's 1 year anniversary. Many feel as if players have been taking the time to learn forbidden commands that the game doesn't normally advertise as a ""way to play"". Let alone, i'm sure many have drawn up conclusions to the idea of these mechanics being ""unfair"", an ""exploitive behavior"" and or ""game breaking"". As they've become a HUGE reason for many to feel under-powered or cheated out of decent, yet fair play matches. But the biggest thing i've noticed is how many are asking: ""What's so special about fling & superman punching?""; ""Why are we complaining over anything?""; ""I'm not affected, so this is just people being cry babies"".**

**-**

**-**

**You see, this becomes more than just what many are arguing as an**   
**""exploit"" or ""cheating"" and absolutely should be removed from the game entirely to weed out or get rid of players who used those mechanics. If anything, everyone who's learned how to do it, believe it to be a tool of PROBLEM SOLVING. Like i've mention in the discord: If i'm being edge guarded during a 2v1, or an enemy or who wont get off my back, how do i overcome this? I climb up and try to time my fling ability I practiced learning how to do, and I hop over an enemy who could easily defeat me or take advantage of my character and prevent me from continuing through the round. In a team score, the game could be on the verge of either a win or a major loss. Tossing yourself and getting to the ball, and or side of the map that requires your attention, could be a massively opportunistic moment to turn the game around and pull through-- based on skill. If in fluffy redemption, A team is winning against the other side, and their train is getting progressively further from the opposing team who's losing, Getting to a high point, flinging to the other side, and solving the problem of how to stop the enemies train-- has now been solved and comes at such a high risk, high reward. Same thing with the start of ANY match. What if you're being dogpiled by everybody in the server? Fling or superman punch yourself out of the crowd, regain, recollect-- and think of a way to tackle the opponents head on and kick animal butt.  What I want everyone to jest is that using these tools, comes at such a rate of almost dooming yourself 95% of the time, and ACTUALLY succeeding only 5% of the time. Like I said before, High risk, High reward.**

**-**

**-**

**-**

**I'm trying to provide reasons for why Flinging and SuperMan punching are/have been tools that could effectively help players achieve issues or levels of random encounters that can prove to be difficult. If these tools at their rawest form, are truly an issue with players who aren't a fan of them, Party Animals developer's (RECREATE), should implement an official mechanic tied to a tutorial/mission that requires players to get from point a to point b using said commands/combos. Even if they decided that this tool could be implemented in a game mode, they also need to consider the issue of wake-up times, the fact that stamina depletion has been increased, and everyone feels less ragdolly/sporadic, and more roboticized and dumbed down.**

If the decision to remove the Macros was implemented during the games first 1-3 months of release, I could totally get behind this change. A foreign amount of people who learned on their own, or even by tutorials on YOUTUBE of how to pull off these advanced move, it would've only been so miniscule. But now that a vast amount of players take note to these tools that the game ALLOWED them to do up until this past update in July... It feels like a slap to the face to many who've been accustomed to the already enjoyable and set gameplay-- ON TOP-- of learning the advanced mechanics as well. By no means, is anyone who is under the belief that this patch was a good idea, are inclined to believe they are WRONG and should feel ashamed or different. Your opinion stands tall and true, so please stick with it if you believe otherwise. But people who want the game reverted back to its original state: Deserve to be understood and heard too.

comment,TanukiB00ty,Adjustments to gameplay/Flinging & Superman Punch Removal.,"I've always said since day 1 that the game was intended for shits'n'giggles. I don't think the developers really ever intended for people to start really going balls to the wall trying to master every trick and tactic and turn the game into an absolute sweat fest that from what I can gather on the official Discord server for Party Animals, EVERYONE was sick of the game and generally unhappy dealing with constant players wiping lobbies or using hidden techs to just slam a game down the drain and force it to end super quick without even giving them a chance to play a bit. 

Personally I've never minded any game people choose to become more skilled or competitive in...IF there is an ACTUAL ranking system or competitive or ""Comp scene""...but Party Animals has NEVER had any of this to begin with...every win doesn't add to any counter or total or ascending a leaderboard...it's legitimately just a temporary victory screen and ya move onto the next. Not to mention everyone who ends up taking the time to sweat so hard over this game just harbors the worst possible attitudes as they'll trash talk on mics/text chats in the end screen or mid-game even...and then when the ""Goofy haha funny winner circle photo moment"" occurs they just legitimately space out vibe checking the camera and don't even try to mess around before the shutter clicks on the camera....it's just PURE pain in the ass and made many people who wanted the game to remain casual/light-hearted start to just leave the game like a sinking ship and ONLY dip a hand back into if we felt so obligated to with battle passes or skin drops so we don't miss out...which is super unhealthy for a player base when the only reason why you bother to even touch the game anymore is just to increase your wardrobe of limited time cosmetics.",2024-07-14 07:40:01,6,
comment,None,Adjustments to gameplay/Flinging & Superman Punch Removal.,"You‚Äôre wrong, the PA discord feedback section is swamped with players speaking out against this game and this change actually makes matches more sweaty. Idk why people think people calling for a nerf of mechanics in the name of balance isn‚Äôt on the same wave length of making this game more try hard.",2024-07-15 23:53:43,2,
comment,None,Adjustments to gameplay/Flinging & Superman Punch Removal.,"A ranking system would be genuine. A way to develop some sort of network of players who want to compete in a seriously competitive manner. I don‚Äôt think that idea is bad nor is it something i feel like a lot of people would be opposed to. I genuinely also believe that as much as many want to believe that the game is not suppose to be crazy or advanced in some form or way‚Äî this game DOES HAVE competitive TWITCH RIVALS/Cash cups for people who are not only content creators and live streamers, but for those who are avid on their progression and skills on PARTY ANIMALS. I think that speaks volumes on the fact that getting good and moving past that casual play style & level of normal gameplay, is definitely expected by the developers. Albeit though, maybe not so much of the remove macros that were originally in the game were legitimately suppose to be in there to begin with? Regardless, I respect and appreciate your take. I believe although, every game is going to eventually start finding itself where players who are adamant about consistency, are going to get better and better at the game. It doesn‚Äôt mean that casual and care free enjoyers aren‚Äôt suppose to enjoy the game. But it‚Äôs almost always expected that games like these are going to have many individuals who want to surpass a basic skill level. We‚Äôre almost nearing a year, and many players have been investing time into it since September. 
-

Albeit though, I really feel as if a ranked mode with these macros re-enabled, and a leaderboards system would sit perfectly. It‚Äôs very obvious that there‚Äôs a scene of people who are not huge fans of this recent update, all through out discord, and even reddit & forums. BUT, the same goes for people who don‚Äôt mind the new update. We‚Äôve also peeped that China servers & Brazil are all not very happy with the game right now either, and China is their main player base.

there needs to be a middle lining for both casual and ranked/competitive players.",2024-07-14 15:36:42,0,
comment,None,Adjustments to gameplay/Flinging & Superman Punch Removal.,"Also, people are unhappy with the fact that the movement system, the stamina drain, and everyone feeling SO restrictive to their play style‚Äî whether you decide to use fling or not‚Äî has now been reduced and is absolutely not enjoyable anymore. They killed so many elements that made the game amazing, even if you didn‚Äôt take the time to learn any of the macros they removed.

And I will say this‚Äî Moderation, An emoji/chat timer, and making it more easy for players to avoid bad interactions‚Äî there should be a new system to get that crap outta the game or servers. I don‚Äôt even bother keeping voice chat on, and i recommend you do the same thing. You don‚Äôt need to listen to toxic folk who make way at eating you or anyone else‚Äôs good vibes and mental away. It‚Äôs not fair to you, and if you can‚Äî block as many people as possible.

And second, there is always going to be a difference between ‚ÄúTry hard Sweaty toxics‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkillfully Advanced & Well rounded players‚Äù. I say this because the majority who are avidly speaking up on this matter are people who don‚Äôt want everyone limited to just a bare bones, super dry, and an awful moveset. It‚Äôs no longer fun when you end up draining all the momentum and energy that takes place during each match, and reduce us to absolute walking slugs with barely any effort to make the games ‚ÄúWoo-Factor‚Äù remain intact and memorable. It‚Äôs just so cut and dry and quite literally, in my opinion, a slap to the face. It‚Äôs not cool to have made such big changes, especially this far on.

comment,scp372,Comeback fling,"that would be true if the game had a skill base matchmaking, but it doesnt, the whole point of the game is goofyness and randomness, you can get used to the weird delay of the movements or the inaccuaracy of the inputs, which are intended game mechanics, to even out the skill base. there will always be better players, but the point is they all have the same chances of winning using the same skillset, an exploit or unintended mechanic gives you an edge over the rest of the players (even more if you need 3rd party guides to learn them), remember that this is a casual game for kids. You cannot expect a father and his child playing the game getting the same sweaty players over an over again and losing to them bc they didnt learn that ""hidden mechanic"", even worse if those players are spamming you the poop emote or shit talking. if removing these kind of stuff is a problem for this kind of players, is because they were never the target audience of the game",2024-07-13 18:40:53,11,

I saw that there is a Party Animals Friend's Pass feature, but I have a few questions about it. 1.) Is it currently still active? The only news from the Steam Page says that it was originally in Beta from Jan to Feb. 2.) Is it limited to one friend pass per lobby, or can we have 4 people with the game invite a collective of 4 people who do not own the game to play?

1. As far as I'm aware, it is still active as I just used it like two nights ago with my friend. Only reason it might not be is if they just disabled it in the patch for the game from today, but I don't know why they would

2. I'm unsure to be honest, I THINK it works like only one person can invite one friend through the friend pass. So if you have 4 people, 2 people would need to own the game so they could each invite another person through the friend pass. That's what I THINK tho, I'm not entirely sure",2024-07-12 18:55:29,0,

comment,RedEyesGoldDragon,Fling was ever intended and it was removed because of people abusing it,"The difference is Smash Bros is a unique case. It has had multiple iterations, years of experience existing as a game, even as MULTIPLE games, years of balancing, amazingly intuitive and responsive controls, and low to no amount of randomness. It has a massive audience and fan base, much more money behind it.

Party Animals is just a re-skin of Gang Beasts. Both games have physics based gameplay and fairly inconsistent knockouts and hitboxes. PA has so much RNG with the map mechanics and people being able to interfere by throwing objects after K/O. There is so little ""skill"" involved in winning rounds and games because of all this. Even people using these ""techniques"" admit they aren't hard.

I'd rather spend my time practising on games or hobbies that make sense to be competitive on, like R6S, for instance. It's one of the toughest games with lots of competition and even cheaters on all consoles, yet I improved my rank and K/D season to season. Another game I play to improve in is Elden Ring, I even do challenge builds.

They would rather the devs artificially help them instead of learning the techs and it‚Äôs making dedicating time into a game and learning techs not worth it anymore.",2024-07-14 17:25:39,1,

comment,None,üìù Patch Notes 1.6.12.0,"You‚Äôre misrepresenting what I am saying here, 

Nowhere did I say I cannot win without it and no one is making that argument when it comes to the removal of the fling. Flinging was possible for everyone, was fun to do and was gratifying for players to learn and use because it allows for skill expression. 

Players are on an even playing field, both have the ability to use the fling, just because only one took the time to learn it then and one did not does not mean they‚Äôre on an uneven playing field. 

It just means one has more experience than the other. 

Flinging is possible on all platforms and peripherals I did it on my controller just fine. It took some time to learn in a custom, but after that it was not hard to do; and while I do think it can be very useful and a lot of fun it is not by any means an automatic win button. 

If you can‚Äôt beat someone due to your inability to learn a tech then the game is changed to accommodate you for your shortcomings, *how good are you really?*

I‚Äôm still gonna play PA regardless. This is just a trend I‚Äôve noticed in a lot of games now; the war against skill in the name of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù",2024-07-13 21:30:01,2,
comment,Datboibarloss,üìù Patch Notes 1.6.12.0,"That's the kicker. It's not a competitive game where everyone needs to learn tech. It's a party game for mainly kids. They have to keep it kid friendly because this is not Rainbow Six Siege. It's meant for everyone to be on an even playing field without spending extra time learning mechanics.

At the end of the day that's just what it is, you can hate on my stance but the game is already changed.

The devs took their stance and if you don't agree then you'd have to get used to it or just quit",2024-07-13 21:33:23,0,
comment,None,üìù Patch Notes 1.6.12.0,"That sword cuts both ways my friend. It‚Äôs not a comp game where everyone needs to learn a tech, so following that logic why remove something to in the name of ‚Äúbalance?‚Äù

Also as I said before flinging is not an automatic win button like you‚Äôre making it seem. It shines for traversing the environment most and when used defensively.

Also I‚Äôm gonna attack your premise some more, it‚Äôs not a self evident truth that the game is inherenlty meant for everyone to be on an even playing field. 

There‚Äôs weapons on the map that provide an unfair advantage, there players trying to kill only you with objects after they die. That‚Äôs an uneven playing field. There‚Äôs map hazards that‚Äôs an uneven playing field. 
People with wired connections will be able to react faster than those without. That‚Äôs an uneven playing field. 

Of all those things listed which seems have more fairness and accessibility to this even playing field you mentioned? 

1.) players spending time to learn to fling if they want to 

Or 

2.) get a wired connection, so everyone‚Äôs equal. Don‚Äôt use any weapons or everyone use weapons for an even playing field. No players are allowed to kill each other with items after death (even playing field). Remove all map hazards to make the game an even playing field. 

This game design philosophy of forcing equity/an even playing field is bunk. Instead the equal opportunity to learn more skillful techniques, if the player wants is better. 

This philosophy of forcing an even playing field does not make for good design choices and it alienates players who dedicate time getting good in the name of helping players who are more casual and the kicker is those casual players don‚Äôt care if flinging is available to be used and if they do and they can learn. Although I would argue someone who complains about game balance and wants things changed is not exactly a *casual*

Instead I think we should have the approach of: *what is fun for players* like Gabe Newell talks about for his design philosophy in making the Half Life games. 

Not this focus on ‚Äúbalance‚Äù in an E for everyone game. It‚Äôs like when players complain about realism in a game to justify balance changes. No player cares about what‚Äôs realistic we care about what‚Äôs fun. 

Bottom line flinging isn‚Äôt an auto win button, you should stop acting like it is. Flinging was an acceptable form of skill expression available to everyone and this war on skill in video games is bunk af and so is your support for it. I do appreciate the counter points you provided though.",2024-07-14 17:47:19,1,

comment,Hjaaal,Fling Movement has been Patched :(,"Awful change. Extremely awful. As the game ages, naturally players are going to get a lot better and better using more advanced techniques like flinging. Not talking about the ball throwing here, but about yeeting yourself. It's like removing advanced techniques from Rocket League, like half flipping and flip cancelling. The game thrives on making use of unintentional stuff like that.

It's essential and FUN when playing against other good players.

I played a few matches today. A few ruined things are:

* Jumping far on Icebreaker to save your butt when the ice split
* Jumping onto the platform in a single jump on Wind Tunnel
* Reliable saves from the sides on Conveyor
* Fun Jump spins with two-hand weapons
* Crazy jumps with the bat
* Headbutt kicking people while holding them
* Saving yourself on Winter is Coming when on ice
* Fun jumps against the soccer ball 

Basically any fun jump with and without weapons is impossible now. I just tested it to check if it's really that bad. Yeah it is. Ruins the game for me.

Idk what they are thinking though... if you saw someone breakdancing would you think it would be safe to go right next to them. I think not. So don't be surprised when I knick you out.  
I don't dance in real life either... but I am a musician so I do have rhythm.   Do you have any of the inner tube summer characters yet.  I've been using them lately .  Inner tube otter especially.   Matching outfits will cause people fits though.  That makes them madder.",2024-07-30 03:18:43,1,

Also, the characters that i‚Äôm fighting against are all doing the SAME thing.

Has anyone else faced this recently? And PS, someone said a long time ago that if you check the player info list, and the players icons take a while to load‚Äî it means they‚Äôre AI, and that‚Äôs exactly what it did.

comment,TrueEvil_,Matchmaking Taking Longer,"Sounds like you got placed into bot lobbies, which can happen if quick match takes a long time without finding players. There was an update to the game within the last 12 hours or so, but the game lets you keep playing on outdated versions. You will only be able to match with other people on the same version, though. What might have happened is that the patch came out while you were playing, and you played long enough that most people on the same game version quit, and anyone starting the game was playing on a different version.",2024-07-04 20:24:43,2,
comment,redditnoob_threeve,Matchmaking Taking Longer,"Bots are easy to identify. Yes the picture loading for a moment is one sign. But they're also locked in at certain EXP levels. I've seen 2500, 7500, and 10000 EXP marks. They also have a very clear behavior. Like you mentioned, the jump kicks. They're just about never punch. Very rarely do they pick people up. I think I've only ever seen the hard mode bots pick people up. They also follow you almost like a stalker. They are also pretty consistent in their behaviors. A new player won't always have the same behaviors because they're learning and adapting. Bots are just consistent based on the difficulty of bot they are (easy, medium, hard) 


The more you play and look for the signs, the easier it will become to identify them.  The key is to be looking for the signs (EXP, picture, etc) to identify which ones to look at so that you can learn their behavior.

When I play solo I either get the easy bot as a partner, or a low level that is most likely a small child and is worse than a bot. When I play in a 3 man team, the 4th is always a bot. I don't know why the game isn't better at matching up solos with squads. I guess it's because they fill in the lobbies with bots to reduce matchmaking time. This especially makes sense if the player count has indeed gone down. No one wants to wait 5 min for a full non bot lobby. 

One suggestion is if you could input your own matchmaking preferences. Things like no team score, no last stand, no bots, etc. Problem with that is it would further segment the player base and increase matchmaking times. I personally hate team score games unless I'm in a full squad because I always get a trash team and have to play 3-4 times harder than I should need to in order to win. So I would never play team score if they let me.

submission,epicdrew12,3-Star Black Sails Easily,"The best way I found to consistently 3-star black sails, as well as beast mode with duo, composes of grabbing headbutts and using the bow for the sailors jumping in. Basically, when you start off the first 2 waves, your main objective is to immediately grab the sailors when they dropkick onto your ship. Spam the headbutt button when you‚Äôre grabbing them, most of the time you‚Äôll knock them out (you will probably knock yourself out 10% of the time but it‚Äôs still the most consistent way of efficiently removing them). Not doing this will sometimes be overwhelming, especially on the last wave, when about 10 of them come in at once.

This is where the bow comes in. After hitting the sea monster with arrows, the bows will DESPAWN. However, right after, the first sailor is always the parrot with the bow. If you can grab and headbutt the parrot and immediately dispose of him, you can potentially pick up the bow and start shooting towards the other sailors jumping in. This is the most important part I feel for getting the 3-stars. If you can grab and aim the bow quickly, you can save yourself so much time by simply shooting the sailors as they‚Äôre jumping in, causing them to drop into the water. I took out almost all enemies on the last wave and I got around a 6:45 time using this.

Hopefully this helps those who are frustrated out of their mind getting the achievements for black sails!",2024-07-02 20:11:01,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1dtvfus/3star_black_sails_easily/

The eggs go 1st= 1, 2nd=2, and so on until the last one. You cannnn use Nemo bucks to make up the difference in eggs so it's nice when a box gives you Nemo bucks too.",2024-06-28 17:22:14,2,

Please add back the option to just have one screen where the fun action happens just like how it was in the beta.Its kinda off topic but because of the splitscreen my tv screen have like huge black borders wich blocks like 70% of the screen and i havent found a solution yet to that problem :/

I also only knocked out only 1 of the lizards to get through one the room with the 2 lizards.

This is to punish people who try to abuse it through various means, but it's harmless to people who are incidentally blasted up there a few times by the bomb spam. You can stay on the bottom part of the ramp basically forever and be completely fine.

Also, I don't expect this to be patched, because it's not really a unique exploit. There's multiple ways to survive basically forever on Conveyor, and only one method has ever been patched since the map came out forever ago.

comment,None,SMASH MODE Conveyor exploit double jump perk,"I was taken a bit back when i learned that Conveyor could kill you this way, and here‚Äôs why: 

The inside of the conveyor will kill you if you persist on diving into the deposit area too many times. I‚Äôve accidentally flung myself so far back and was sliding around the inside portion of it‚Äî that the game instantly killed me on command for being in there too long. It‚Äôs like a hit detection area. The game reads off how many seconds your character is in the forbidden area before the game initiates an insta kill for you even attempting to avoid gameplay with the other players. 

So it must‚Äôve realized you were attempting to hide within the confides of the conveyor as you were double jumping and edging the insides back and forth. Even though it‚Äôs crazy cool you can do that‚Äî the game definitely said: ‚ÄúINSTA KILL ON LOCK‚Äù üòÇüòÇ.

comment,Maddogg__101,Beast soccer custom game,People complain about soccer too much. You can get more control over where the balls goes if you kick and you can set up your own goals by bouncing the ball off the wall near goal. It can be hard to hit the ball with the power punch but from my experience doing a u-turn motion with the punch if you‚Äôre half court seems to be more accurate then standard,2024-06-26 18:55:33,3,

comment,TanukiB00ty,Beast soccer custom game,"Honestly Sports modes are just misery incarnate for most people who play the game. I have absolutely no problem with the concept of them cause it adds variety to the game, buuuut...then you get to the reality of 8 fluffy/scaly/feathered animals running up and down a field in a stalemate endlessly trying to notch one point until it ends up a draw or one team gives up and the other notches a point basically forfeiting.   
  
The only sports game I can really enjoy is Buzz Ball or even the American Football one because you can at least grab the ball in question and have more spicy plays with teammates...Soccer and Hockey just feel like people desperately floundering around trying to make a ball/puck GO in a direction that may or may not react to your dropkick/heavy punch...number of times I've drop kicked the soccer ball right in front of the enemy team's goal from the perfect angle and it just goes soaring sideways to a corner of the field can leave me in frustration lmao.",2024-06-27 02:51:37,2,

comment,TanukiB00ty,Smooth move,"Meh, I've always been someone who tried to go against the grain and stride for positivity. 

I pretty much posted habitually around this sub with a funny clip here or there and people genuinely always just picked out the negatives in the clip or mocked the hell out of me for ""Not doing anything special"" or ""Skill issue is more your problem."" 

Which is why I pretty much went cold turkey on the posts around here, play to win and smash the hell outta the competition in this game and throw no caution to the wind for anyone anymore. I'll be nice IRL if I gotta...but the online gaming community most times is an atrocious cesspit that really deserves no respect most of the time with their natural attitudes they take to the games without even being provoked. 

If anyone wonders why this game in particular is dying or starting to struggle it's simply because people kept ignoring the positive minority that wanted to keep the game more humorous and not taken so seriously competitive, I'll happily lend a hand in making this game more deader than a doornail so then everyone can start whining and moaning about ""Oh why does nobody wanna play this game anymore?"".",2024-06-26 07:00:12,1,

I understand with Crossplay because of Sony generally not allowing it. So forget Sony. But this is the type of game that would be insanely popular on Switch!!. If you allowed Crossplay too!!, Sell Physical copies on switch.  Think about this $30 Dollars for a copy. Include a few paid skins included or a few Zelda Based skins, cross play. Boom!

submission,None,AI has some issues/Smash Glitch,"Over the last few games i‚Äôve had, the game ultimately replaces an AFK or player who‚Äôs force quit the match, and will play for you as another teammate. Well‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say, the AI‚Äôs have been doing some funky crap. Randomly out of no where‚Äî i get punched by my AI, and lifted and thrown off as if im the enemy. Then, the AI will go out of its way to try and drop kick me by walking in my direction; jumps and drop kicks me; and headbutts my body for no reason. So i‚Äôm hoping this gets fixed soon.

SMASH: So far, Smash has been fun and really decent with some of the new enhanced pawer ups. However, i feel as if i was put at a complete advantage against a final player in castleween. I got hit by another opponents electric fish, and that resulted in my bob having an infinite electricity touch and effect on my body. Rather than my ability to pick up enemies and electrocute them after so long‚Äî i infinitely was immune to the electric shock and could inflict electricity damage to anyone who touched me or i punched. How do I know this is a glitch? When the sixth round ended and all players were sent to the victory snap shot location‚Äî my character was on the floor being electrocuted to death until the photo snapped and i finally stood up.

comment,Sakiros,Matchmaking is broken,"Sometimes it's hard to tell if high level players are naturally paired by the matchmaking system or they're friends playing as a group, more often than not it is indeed the latter. As a level 100 player I rarely get paired with another level 100 random, 60% of the time I get bots (even when every single other team has all real players), 35% of the time it's someone ranging from level 1 to level 80 and only 5% it's someone who's on my level or close.

Maybe it's because of my unfavorable location but the matchmaking really struggles finding any real human players for me on all servers even during peak hours, I'd even gladly take unfair pairings as long as I get to play with no bots. A few days ago I got a lobby of all humans, all level 100s, it was a great match but this kind of perfect matching pretty much never happens to me, usually I get about 2-3 real people and the rest are bots.",2024-06-17 07:51:31,5,

submission,Pearse_Borty,The doppleganger ability is too obnoxious,"This ability becomes far too powerful when there is more than one doppleganger especially. I have had a game with THREE dopplegangers and it is incredibly frustrating to play against as there is no way to tell friend from foe. Its initially funny, but the gimmick grows old fast and if you've picked something like Soul Link or IT TAKES TWO its GG especially without communication. 

This ability is the bane of solo queue and needs more telegraphing to make it fairer. On closer scrutiny an enemy should be more obvious, but not enough that it would be apparent in the middle of a fray.

Anyway, Ive enjoyed the mode but its literally just this one ability Ive had gripes with. Its just too good, even Quicksilver/Speed boost combos are handier to deal with",2024-06-16 22:23:55,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1dhizsd/the_doppleganger_ability_is_too_obnoxious/

You will be fine if you are just updating your DLSS same goes for any other game you play. If you are modifying the game though.

Even after they nerfed it's still no joke due to its reach but many weapons can indeed kill with enough effort. Not just weapons either, even the weak and useless default kicks can actually kill if you keep hitting a lying player with them long enough, and punching someone to death is the go-to strategy when disposing of an opponent who's snugly sitting in the viewing spot at the top of the Typhoon.",2024-06-15 19:03:42,1,

Steam reviews turned to mixed and negative posts were made in r/pcgaming and other subs, leading to many people writing the game off without a 2nd thought. 

People were also mad about being able to buy skins, which is also a dumb complaint since every skin is easily earned and the game get‚Äòs free updates.",2024-06-12 17:23:15,30,

comment,Lil_Donkey_,This game is so fun why it‚Äôs not very popular?,"I can think of a few reasons.  The game has been out a little while now, for a really long time we had no new maps,  ""egg"" skins have only just been updated so players who finished the level-up pass and had an excess of egg coins may have collected all possible skins so there's no reason to level up, most new game skins seem to be either cats or dogs which people are already a little bored with, PC/kbm players have a serious advantage over controller players when it comes to overall agility.

comment,TioRalph,This game is so fun why it‚Äôs not very popular?,"Sincerely, I don't know why people complain so much about everything! I love this game and I think it's one of the best on Steam right now.

The single problem this game presents, in my opinion, is having to be always online, even though the game can be played locally. I guess this is a choice to minimize hacks and exploits, but there could be a better alternative, as I never want to see this game gone, it's too good to be lost to time.

Other than that, I don't see any problem with the game. Everything works great and the dev messages and ui elements makes it pretty clear how and what everything does. The controls are great, the music are great, the levels are fun and the animals themselves are beyond cute and funny.

All skins can be either won through achievements and challenges, level up, events or purchased with cookies, coins and nemo bucks, all of which gained by simply playing the game. No real necessity to use real world money, unless you lost an event and really want a especific skin in the last minute, but even that is not really an option most of the times. There is no pay to won aspect or option in this game. You simply play and have fun. Plus, new animals, skins, and levels release all the time, and new game modes have recently released as well.

It's a shame more people are not experiencing this gem, it quickly became one of my favorite games ever since the demo, and that's coming from someone that's been into games since the 90s. Hope it grows in the hearts of people in time! Just watch the videos on Party Animals youtube channel for  the events and new characters and you'll love it already for how cute everything is!",2024-06-13 12:22:38,1,

comment,redditnoob_threeve,Sometimes this game is just unfair.,"Green crossbow doesn't need a nerf. You can easily dodge and confuse the targeting system. I dodge them all the time.

Red crossbow doesn't need a nerf itself. It's also easily able to be dodged. However, the suction cups from red crossbow need a red balance. You can pile so many on a player that you can't even hit them with a punch or kick because the stuck darts block it. Even picking the player up is impossible. And if they're on there a certain way, the affected player can't even walk. Either limit the amount of darts that can stick to any single player or reduce the time they're stuck for.",2024-06-13 23:48:23,2,

Game's on a small discount, would you say it's still worth picking this up?

I wouldn't have any friends to play with, so I'd mainly matchmake with randoms and play with wife.

Is the game getting frequent updates? I saw a trailer for it with new stuff coming just yesterday, so I'm assuming.

Would the new updates be included in the base game or would that be an expansion as well for additional money?

How are skins earned, is it grindy for them?

Most importantly, is the game alive for matchmaking, as in you don't sit in queue waiting for people?",2024-06-09 19:30:37,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartyAnimalsGame/comments/1dc1za1/thinking_of_picking_this_game_up/

I find it a lot more fun with friends, but playing alone can be fun as well! Definitely a good game to play with a significant other because it‚Äôs not too hard to pick up, even if they‚Äôre not into gaming. It‚Äôs just good silly fun and not too competitive.

The game has a small dev team so the updates aren‚Äôt always huge, but there are definitely a good amount of regular updates to keep the game fun and fresh. They‚Äôve also teased a few new things coming that are very exciting.

Everything is included in the base game. There is a premium currency that you can pay for but it can also be obtained without paying any money. If you play a lot you can unlock everything for free, except for past event limited cosmetics. There is no P2W aspects here though. Everything is strictly cosmetic that you can spend currency on. Some things take longer to unlock, but getting all of the animals and plethora of skins isn‚Äôt too grindy. It‚Äôs a mix of leveling up, completing achievements, and using currency you get form playing in the shop. If you want EVERY skin‚Ä¶ prepare to sink some time in lol.

The game is very much alive. For NA East I find matches within 10 seconds of searching. Never had any issues finding a match.

90% of the time I play this game it‚Äôs with random people in custom matches or quick match.

So far every single skin has been obtainable through challenges or using cookies and Nemo bucks which are also obtainable through challenges and leveling up. And some rare skins are available by doing twitch drops. Although everything can be earned for free they have sometimes brought in past twitch drops for real world money in the item shop for people who missed them. That‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve ever seen actually require real money. All events and skins are earned for free

 There are tons of skins to unlock and a couple redeemable codes that you can get for free too.I highly recommend this game.


Edit: there's a Dragon boat pass that's free you just have to do challenges to unlock there's three skins included in it

comment,BarBarBar22,Thinking of picking this game up,"It‚Äôs very funny game, I would definitely recommend it - even for playing it solo. I play solo most of the time and I still have a blast. 

We are getting frequent updates, most of the updates only adding new skins. However we also got new mode, missions and sometimes we get new map for quick matches although I won‚Äôt lie to you - updates with new maps are kinda rare and it would definitely be better if they can give us new maps more frequently. However with events like new mini passes there is still plenty to do and game feels fun. 

So far there was no additional costs for new updates. 

There are multiple ways how to unlock new skins:

1) battle pass - it‚Äôs for free and you are gaining experiences via playing the game and completing weekly challenges. It‚Äôs not too grindy, if you are playing on a regular basis then you should be fine. Pass has 100 levels which may sounds like a lot but so far it seems that this battle pass is here to stay forever so no FOMO. Hopefully they won‚Äôt change it. 

2) Mini battle passes - these are new, usually pretty short, passes that has lot of new cosmetics and there are in the game as a limited time event but again, all these new mini passes so far were completely free you could pay Nemo bucks (one of the in game currency) to unlock all the things right away or if you don‚Äôt have time to complete it and you want some skin badly. But this is just optional, you can complete these time limited passes by completing challenges that are provided 

3) You can buy skins from shop - there are two in game currencies: cookies which are very easily earnable just by completing battle pass and from weekly challenges. Usually you have lot of these. Another in game currency is more rare - Nemo bucks. You can also earn it from battle pass, or sometimes there are events - like twitch drops etc but in general these are more difficult to earn but in comparison to other similliar games I still find it pretty easy. Also this is the currency that you can buy with real money. 

4) Events - twitch drops, we got free skin for women‚Äôs day etc. 

So as you can see game is pretty player friendly and you can have lot of skins without spending any money.",2024-06-10 10:18:16,2,
comment,TioRalph,Thinking of picking this game up,"I bought it at launch and have been playing it solo since the 2020 demo. I highly highly recommend it! It's one of the most fun games ever for me, and that's coming from someone who's into games since the 90s and not even a fan of online multiplayer games in general.

The skins are earned by simply playing the game:

-You can gain them by leveling up (happens as you play);

-From achievements and weekly challenges which are super fun (hitting x animals with a fish, playing with a feline animal in x matches, etc);

-From special events and partnerships (happen all the time);

-From the store, that can be bought with cookies and coins earned by simply playing, with luck pulls on a egg slot machine or with real money, which is something I have never done and never felt the need to, although I certainly intend to to support the developers.

New skins are added frequently and new game modes have been added recently.

There hardly is any toxic player, at least in my time playing it, and the rare few that comes up can be muted and ignored. Sometimes when someone like that enters the game sayng stupid stuff, all the animals in the match teams up to punch him (I certainly did it already, and happens more than one would imagine, it's guaranteed laugh!)

After you finish a match, you have a couple of seconds to take a picture and save it on your computer, and all the players will fight to be centered in the shot or to appear funny on the photo.

The matchmaking is pretty fast. It used to be even faster at launch, but even today it takes less than one minute to find a game. While it finds the match, you can save additional copies of the photo taken and add the animals from the last match as friends. To connect with any of them is super easy as well, just click over them on your friends list and send an invite to join your game.

The levels and the music are fun, and the animals themselves are beyond cute and funny!

The game is so much fun that even when I lose, I generally keep laughing my spirit out of my body.

To add to all that, the game even has local split screen, which is something that I missed so much in games.

If you like laughing your life out, I highly recommend this game. It quickly became one of my favorites!",2024-06-11 15:19:01,1,

comment,Firerain9X,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"I think there is a system where if you pick a Pawer, then there is an increased chance that you receive Pawers in future rounds that synergize well with what you have. Not sure if it's guaranteed though, and it can stink when your favorite Pawers never show up in an entire game of SMASH.

Now it makes me want a Custom Lobby gamemode where the game is like classic ""One map, first to three wins"", but the host or the players select what (up to 6) Pawers to start the game with. It would be chaotic fun if everyone started with Super Gatling Gun and Super Ranged Master; rapid fire projectiles flying everywhere!",2024-06-09 01:53:45,3,

comment,Firerain9X,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"Sounds cool! It would help ranged weapon users punish those who take the optimal route of attacking from behind.

comment,Firerain9X,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"So Face-Off allows someone to take on a disguise as an opponent's teammate, down to their character, username, and team color. If you equip this Pawer, your opponents see you as their teammate. If an opponent picks this Pawer, you will see two teammates; one of them is a faker/imposter.

From what I can tell, if a Face-Off user gets knocked out enough times, their Pawer will disappear and expose them as their actual character, username, and team color. If you equip this Pawer, there is a fancy mask icon next to your character icon; if the mask icon disappears, you have lost your disguise. Not sure if Super Face-Off removes this restriction; I haven't doubled it up yet (if it is even possible to get it twice).",2024-06-11 03:23:04,1,

comment,Firerain9X,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"Maybe? As powerful as ranged weapons become with 2x Gatling Gun and 2x Ranged Master, once someone running this combo gets knocked out and thus drops their ranged weapon, they are likely to be at a disadvantage from then on. They would only have 0-2 other Pawers to work with depending on what round it is.",2024-06-09 07:23:31,2,
comment,Cartrimino13,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,True but you cannot say that the last part of the video wouldn't be annoying to deal with.,2024-06-09 07:24:42,1,
comment,Cartrimino13,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"I mean, I was playing smash yesterday with some well competitive players with super Gatling on ice breaker. They were on a separate piece of ice with a crossbow. Me and the other people in the lobby had to team up to take him down. (And by that I mean they try to kill him and fail while I ledge camp him.)",2024-06-09 07:27:22,2,
comment,Firerain9X,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"Fair points; it does sound hard or near impossible to take out someone with this combo who has found a spot away from the main brawling to shoot from afar. Only other counterplay I can think of is to go after players with Ranged Master at the start of the round to disarm them and/or make sure to keep Gatling Gun users away from ranged weapons or throw the ranged weapons off the map, though with the chaotic and fast paced nature of this game that's way easier said than done.

Another thing to consider is Ice Breaker's slippery floors were likely a major factor in causing Super Gatling Gun to be super effective. I've noticed the ""final round"" map tends to be Ice Breaker, Ichiban, or Castleween, so a 33% chance to have ranged weapon Pawer users be very strong is significant, which can be frustrating for others to deal with.

I appreciate you have the perspective to think about how it would feel to fight against something strong.",2024-06-09 08:17:00,1,
comment,Sakiros,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"But it's highly situational and unlikely. This specific Pawer combination is already rare to come by, and the chance of the final map being Ice Breaker is only 1/3, plus you also need to get lucky and spawn with a crossbow at the beginning and not another type of ranged weapon. I think having this kind of substantial advantage is a fair reward considering how many stars have to align in your favor to get to this point, not to mention it still doesn't guarantee you a victory (you almost fell into the water in the video which would have forced you to abandon the gun). To me it seems already well balanced.",2024-06-09 08:39:36,2,
comment,Firerain9X,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"Also true. Like you said, RNG has to be in a player's favor to get a set combo like in the video. I'm just having fun discussing it, as wracking my brain trying to think out counterplay options now might help me in the future if and when I have to fight this Pawer combo.

Also, that was a close call with me almost slipping off the ledge XD. I was going for a standing kick to the Macchiato to nudge them off.",2024-06-09 09:19:46,1,
comment,Cartrimino13,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,Yeah. I mean I have had experience fighting this and somehow won every time.,2024-06-09 08:43:22,1,
comment,Cute_Fluffy_Sheep,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,I really do not like the disguise one.  It is so frustrating üòÖ,2024-06-09 14:31:13,1,
comment,Firerain9X,Stacking the new ranged weapon Pawers is crazy!,"Yeah it can be confusing trying to figure out who is your teammate when one or more opponents pick the Face-Off Pawer. So far I found out two ways to counter this.

* Use emotes or text chat: Your name will display your team's color to everyone
   * You can emote to signal your teammate you are friends
   * Disguised players will show up as their team's color if they emote/chat
* Pay attention to what Pawers your teammate has
   * Example: I had a Sakura Maneki as my teammate who picked Berserker on Round 1, so they had devil horns and dark red eyes the whole game. Even when two opponents picked Face-Off, I could tell who my teammate was right away.",2024-06-09 22:24:13,2,

Also I saw my teammates name and animal when the other team won as he was copying my teammate. I think it wears off only when you get knockout because I also saw one changing back when he got knockout.,2024-06-08 16:37:20,2,
comment,Sakiros,Is there a new Pawer in Smash?,"So it's possible for an opponent to briefly deactivate my disguise by KOing me? Neat, so that's why there's a mask icon next to the stamina bar, it tells you when you're disguised and when you aren't.",2024-06-08 16:45:47,3,
comment,doodlephile,Is there a new Pawer in Smash?,I think so I saw one changed after getting knocked out. I really want to try this Pawer i hope get it next time. It's also fun that they added Smash in Quick Match. Also thanks for the info. üòä,2024-06-08 16:48:00,2,

It's surely a tricky thing to deal with, especially when others are using it. One time two separate teams use it and I saw extra two of my teammate. Sure enough I didn't know which to attack. When my teammate became invisible, then it was easy to identify them.",2024-06-09 05:53:49,3,

Lol like I said, if you actually read, you could have gotten T Pain for free.. Meaning you can't anymore. Meaning that was in the past. Meaning the majority of the player base, which weren't playing back then, couldnct have possibly gotten him for free. Meaning when you said that the item shop is ALL free, you were wrong. Because the word ""is"" means now. Not back then. The fact that him showing up regularly with a real money price tag is 100% proof of that, which leads many who can see the writing on the wall, to believe it will definitely happen again. But I'm not gonna assume the future, just like you shouldn't assume that the majority of the current player base played the game in the past, and should already have T Pain for free. I'm not trying to bash the game in any way. I love the game. But just being realistic. I'm sure some naive people will say ""That won't happen to this game"", or ""This is a paid game. That only happens in free to play games"". Which by the way is NOT true. It happens across the board. Itcs just exaggerated more in F2P games, because that's how they make their money. Also, don't forget that Fall Guys at one time was a paid game as well. And look at that game now. It went free to play, and literally every single cosmetic item that isn't the lowest of low tiered items is 100% real currency. I'm just saying. I hope this game doesn't come anywhere close to that. But don't be surprised when more and more skins start costing real money. It will eventually come to a point where it's either charge real money or they won't be able to keep afford to  developing the game and adding new game modes, maps, and cosmetic items. I guess when that time comes, then you can come back here, say ""oops my bad"" and take away your immature downvotes.

comment,redditnoob_threeve,Gifting cookies skins?,"They probably wouldn't do this. You can convert nemo bucks to cookies. Meaning you could possibly purchase  cookie based skins due to this conversion. If they just let you gift cookies skins, they could lose that revenue stream.

Putting in 100k skins also probably wouldn't happen because they would alienate the more casual player base and it would discourage newer players. On top of that, you would instantly get targeted for using it, and would then probably stop using it. That's why you rarely see the Platinum skin. A lot of people have it, but it immediately paints a target on your back. So many have opted not to use it.

One thing they could do is unlock the level cap of 100, and offer EXP bonus purchases with cookies. People could display their actual level (some prouder than others), and have somewhere for all those excess cookies to go. Some people would be level 300+ at this point if it wasn't capped. It wouldn't prevent skin purchases (a source of revenue), but would allow players to spend their cookies and display their achievements.

While they're very generous with what they give to players, at the end of the day, they need to make money. They have server bills, employee costs, licensing costs, salaries, etc. Doing anything to clip their revenue stream probably wouldn't happen.",2024-06-06 22:13:07,2,

comment,redditnoob_threeve,Gifting cookies skins?,"But it isn't as easy to accumulate enough Nemo bucks to do that. Players are more likely to convert for multiple smaller rewards than sink it into an overinflated reward. Plus, anyone who has enough Nemo bucks to do that will surely have more than enough cookies that they won't need to convert it. So while it is possible, it's probably way less likely to happen.

Now, if there are whales out there, that's a different story. But I don't really see this game as having a huge whale group.",2024-06-07 21:27:32,1,

submission,None,What happened to these characters and locations?,"Party Animals two trailers between June of 2021 to December 2022,and they showcase a few things:

-Godzilla as a playable character
-An Animal Talent Show Arena (gives off into the game vibes)
-A Martial Arts Rhino playable character
-A map that looks to be a Tokyo/China town district area with BIG FISH, and an Octopus Tail
-And a Lobster/Crab Character shown with Tuskar

I don‚Äôt know if these details were purposefully left out due to the ongoing development of Party Animals for various reasons‚Äî or if the characters weren‚Äôt working in the devs favor for what the system could keep up with at the time; style and direction for what the base characters at launch would be; the map of the tokyo/chinatown like district was a potential lab mode setting that got put to the side for creative reasons. It‚Äôs all so interesting to look back on, and it leaves me curious: What do you think?

comment,WesDoesGAMING,New Maps/Ideas,"I thought of a Capture the Flag type of gamemode?

Or maybe a Domination like mode where your objective is to capture zones like A, B and C.

Maybe a gamemode where there's either a moving/still capture area you stay in and the longer you're in it, the more points you get? 

What about a gamemode where you focus on the most knockouts or most kills?

Maybe a challenge gamemode where you gotta be the first to complete a set of challenges to win? For example:
First Challenge: Punch an Opponent
Second Challenge: Headbutt an Opponent
Third Challenge: Heavy Punch an Opponent
Forth Challenge: Dive kick an Opponent
Fifth Challenge: Melee Kill an Opponent with 'blank'
And so forth until like, First to 20?

Tournament Mode where its 1v1s in the Cast Away boxing ring without items going down the bracket? That'd go pretty quick so maybe first to three kills?

Maybe add a ghost racing feature on Missions?

4v4 team on the two ships in Black Sails. Fully controllable ships and you gotta either sink their ship with canon balls or kill them a specific amount of times. As the timer is mid way done, the octopus comes out and you cant use your canon balls until you shoot it away. ORRR maybe there's specific spots you have the captain of your ship sail to that will summon the octopus on the enemy side as a temporary distraction.

Maybe a Free for All Infected gamemode where there is 1 randomly chosen animal who starts off dirty and all the other animals are clean. The dirty animal has to pass the smell to a clean animal by either grabbing them or knocking them out before the 1 minute timer hits 0, or else you'll die. If an animal dies, whoever passed it last becomes dirty and this continues until there is only one animal left. Maybe as the game progresses, the map bounds gets smaller and smaller with less people.

Add Shiba Inu with a black beanie god dammit. üò§ I will be the happiest man. üß°üíØ

submission,EthansWay007,"Hard AI mode, All hard mode AI player reveals a design flow in the game code...","Let me explain: On hard mode with all AI players (Create Custom Game), the AI players turn into indestructible hit sponges. I whacked one player with a shovel five times in a row. Each time, they bounced backward like a free-standing punching bag ‚Äì five times in a row! I smacked another player with the shovel, and it literally bounced off their back like I'd hit a wall, umm only walls bounce shovels, if it bounces off a player that means it hit theemmmm....

Also, not to brag, but I'm pretty good at the flying kick. I landed my usual head kicks, only to have the AI players bounce backward like those same punching bags. They grunt, but keep on trucking as if nothing happened.

So, if the game code allows this, it‚Äôs possible this could happen in a match with live players too. Ever landed a flying head kick only for the player to lean back a little and keep running? Ever nailed someone with a shovel straight to the noggin, and they just bounce back a bit? Try playing all AI on hard mode and see the madness for yourself.

Bot difficulty directly affects their incoming/outgoing damage, and not factors like behavior. It's stupid, but that's all the setting does. They want the hard mode bots to be able to tank hits.

As for this happening in live matches: it absolutely does. And I believe this is by design. I am very much convinced that the variables affecting bot strength & resilience are applied to players as well. I could be wrong, but it seems like the intention is for the game to remain random, and not always guarantee knockouts even on very well-placed hits.",2024-06-02 22:27:26,3,

discovery/observation of the AI at the hardest difficulty. Assuming, that this is the equivalent to the AI being on par to a real player. My only thing about the idea that a player could attempt/achieve the behavior of a Hard Ai, is the fact that they must be setting certain pre sets for the health, knockout affect, and wake up stamina values for every match differently. So, it really depends on how they tweak with the maps current numbers/values.

comment,WachAlPharoh,Are we in the wrong,"I think that the purpose of the collab is for devs to encourage players to support both games, I think that's nice in theory. That said, the execution was poorly done for anyone who bought the games on console before the collab was announced. I backed Sandrock back in 2020, and loved that Nemo and Macchiato were in that game when PA was released and I realized the easter egg. When this collab was announced however I was disappointed that as a consumer supporting both properties, I was denied a code due to my console choice and time frame of purchase. I think it is unreasonable to ask those who have already paid for both games to pay for Sandrock again on the 'correct' platform.

Now in regards to your specific question OP, if they are not planning on buying PA now or ever then they should share the codes, as this way they can help fellow gamers, sharing in the attempt that the devs made in sharring in each other's success with this collab. But, and especially on reddit, the 'cozy game' communities are very rude and impatient, as the time and money has already been given to Sandrock, why not give the code to someone who gives the same to Party Animals, all in the spirit of boosting both games? It isn't a scam as the code was still given out to the players, it doesn't matter which player uses it at that point, at least imo.",2024-05-30 17:43:53,6,
comment,aaaaaaaaawiwjwkw,Are we in the wrong,"I agree with you, the collab was a disaster, now Sandrock makes players play 10 hours before getting the code, and someone here said that they bought it on eBay, the collab was a disaster and I wish they would have added community skins rather than a Pensky who doesn‚Äôt even have his tongue out like cabbage dog",2024-05-30 17:52:55,5,

comment,SEOKHMET,Are we in the wrong,"I don't think it's scamming per se, specially if people who play MtaS don't intend on playing Party Animals and can just give out their codes to friends or someone who asks. My issue with people asking for the codes come when they try to guilt trip you into giving your code. 

I say this because I won keys to both Party Animals (I'm giving it to a friend, since I already own the game) and My Time At Sandrock since I was one of the 3 Twitter giveaway winners. I was able to get the game, launch it and get my own code without having to play it (I intend to since it looks pretty cute), but I cannot tell you how low some people can go for, just for a silly code.

I was approached through twitter DMs by some guy who was desperately trying to get both of my game keys in exchange of another game, and when I said no because I already had plans for them, he tried to play the pity card by claiming to be disabled and suffering from cerebral palsy so I'd give him my keys. This is an absolutely disgusting move and such a low thing to do just for a code. For anyone out there hoping to get a code: If you want a code just ask nicely, don't try to guilt trip people into giving you one üò≠",2024-05-31 10:43:48,4,
comment,Cartrimino13,Are we in the wrong,"Definitely not. Heck, I'd say that we as a fan base are being scammed. As said before, the idea of supporting both games is what a Collab should aim to do, I mean if Nemo appeared as a follower in Cult of the Lamb that would be a perfect example, but the Sandrock Devs just used it as a damn cash grab. 

1. Sandrock players got the Party Animals Collab without having to pay anything. We should have as well.

2. We are being taken advantage of as a community because they think we will do anything for a skin and the PA fan base is much bigger than MTaS. So if we all buy the game, they almost triple profit.

3. The Sandrock Devs themselves tweeted that they would try and win the Pensky Game Key. This means that one more person had to buy the game because they already knew the answer.

4. We have to play ten hours of a game we probably don't even like just to be able to access the code. They only did this so we can't refund and they get more money.

5. The Sandrock community is much more toxic than us. Because of the Collab, Sandrock could be gaining more attention. The next thing you know, people associate us with that toxic community, like how stupid looking animals are often associated with competitive players.

6. If someone is an Xbox player that already had Sandrock, they then have to buy the game again on 'the correct platform' and replay the first ten hours. This in general is just unfair and shouldn't be an issue.",2024-05-31 19:45:19,2,

Orange text on an orange background is pretty horrible for reading. Adding an internal drop shadow to the small text makes it even less readable. The text is both too much, too close to the edge, and harder to read since you put it on an angle (think about how it would be read on a table or when being held in a hand - depends on what kind of game you are trying to make). The icons at the top are completely devoid of contrast and cannot be easily read in a glance. There are only hues of the same color.which makes it visually boring. If you plan on having the cards printed, it is best practice to provide a white border to allow for cutting and slight misalignment of printed design. finally, depending on what the card game is, and the mechanics you are implementing, WAY to much of the visual space is taken up with seemingly useless information (the name, banner, and image represent almost 80% of the visual data being seen).",2024-05-31 02:00:04,3,

submission,None,Master Pass Vs Shen Loong Pass,"Preferably, which additional battle pass would event was your favorite???

The music in the lobby changed to something groovy and funky, the multi-elemental lotus‚Äôs and emojis looked awesome, same with the photo frames and eventual unlock of Shen Loong himself. Just a more enjoyable form of the pass.

The Master Pass: I mainly digged it because we received more new content. Mainly enjoyed it for the Levi & Lloyd skins, plus the Fuguee Raincoat variation.

I missed the first couple days and the first double XP weekend but then did the challenges daily and made it with about a week to spare. Some of the challenges weren't that fun like hitting people w/ fishes or playing the SMASH games (they just took way too long, I would AFK through them with AI)

The average points needed per level on the Panda pass was much better, rather than the dragon pass where it was 15k+ for the final level, that felt like it really dragged on, although that one was only 15 levels, iirc, and the newer one was 20.",2024-05-28 18:36:58,8,

I like Assassin Levi a lot, probably my favorite out of any skin in either pass. It takes everything I like about Ronin Hachi and enhances it. But I don't care for the other Master Pass skins, while I like most forms of Lotus.

I like the quests of the Master Pass more, at least the ones where they ask you to play animals with different traits. It gives you an excuse to use different characters. On the other hand I didn't like the quests requiring you to play modes other than Quick Match. Those seemed to become less common overtime though.

Length wise I think the Master Pass was also way easier to complete? Unless I'm mistaken I remember the latter half of the Shen Pass being really long, while each level of the Master Pass took more or less the same amount of experience.

I don‚Äôt blame you at all for enjoying the master pass more. I think the biggest issue with shen loong WAS the fact that they didn‚Äôt issue out the correct XP boost, and the fact that the XP did get shorter as you‚Äôd go along. So it was a trip and a half to deal with closer to the end. My partner and friend did admit to me that they just bought the final two stages of lotus & loong so they didn‚Äôt miss the deadline.
