            "body": "I'm gonna drop my text here since whenever I try to inject it into the post description with a clip it tends to bug for me.\n\nThis guy was above and beyond just being rude af, the pair of Lava Maneki's politely typed into the chat in the lobby if people could let them try for the achievement where you stay on the plane 'till it's almost time up...the Assassin Levi legitimately made it known from the get-go that he was going to aim to ruin it and pretty much every game he gunned for the maneki's, I decided to try and help them out even though I have already gotten the achievement a long time ago...and they were super appreciative...but it all kinda went down the drain and we couldn't stay alive as long as the first time even employing some tips from Vicksy using weapons to balance ourselves and a few other strats I taught them just by emoting.\n\nI didn't expect this KofiS dude to really come and send me a friend request (I mistook it was one of the Maneki's not paying a great deal of attention to names) and friended me just to drop a few lengthy paragraphs mocking me as a person and saying \"It was the greatest feeling in the world to deny you that stupid achievement\"...when I explained I already had it and told him politely to stop being a cyber bully for no reason other than to bully people trying to have some fun...he got fuming...funny how for once I wasn't even being targeted and then get targeted for helping some poor achievement hunters lol.",

We all just watched you ignore your surroundings to grab a bomb twice, get punished for it both times by players that were on your screen (they didn't come out of nowhere, you ignored them and went for the item). But they are sweats for \"checks notes\" not letting you grab the bomb for free? Like for that second bomb grab you definitely have the horse blinders on staring at blue in the distance even though green is right in front of you squared off to you ready to deliver that drop kick to a stationary target. Try to tell us honestly this wasn't a misplay on your part because you were mad at the blue dude for knocking your socks off a few seconds before. Like at least you kind of walked away from the blue guy in the first encounter but you stopped dead in your tracks after throwing the bomb almost like your bot brain had to slowly calculate what to do next and as soon as blue was the right distance to heavy punch they just had to hit heavy punch. Since you weren't moving the spacing wasn't changing making that an easy heavy punch for blue to hit. smh",

            "body": "Im only posting this because I'm genuinely curious if anyone knows anything about it. So last night I was playing a match on ice breaker. At the beginning of the match I beat a guy named Esssssyy who you could immediately tell got super salty and started focusing me no matter what the score in the match was or who was about to win. His team was in last the whole time and he almost entirely edge camped with weapons and emoji spammed. At the end my team ended up losing to a blue team because my partner got item focused and knocked into the water. No big deal. \n\nThen we reque and go to a new match of beast hockey. I immediately noticed this essy guy was on our team. Instead of being normal and letting it go even though we lost. He spent the entire match chasing after me and not even doing it well. We still only lost by one with being down a player. Right afterwards my partner and I both reported him for trolling teammates. Idk if anyone has had this happen before. But what is the likelihood they'll punish him for it? It's just annoying and childish behavior. For added detail I did look at his profile and he's level 100 which somehow made it more sad because he was not very good. Pretty quickly after the report I noticed his profile disappeared from my recents. ",

            "body": "There's a lot that happened in a very short span of time. A few patches ago, they removed something called the \"fling\" (heavy punch, jump, dropkick in succession to send your character flying) which was a beloved movement tech in the community. They did this by targeting successive inputs in a hope to stop macro abusing players. This also made it so waking up from knockouts took significantly longer. The devs' intention here was to stop macro abusers from insta-waking up. After community outrage, they brought back the fling but increased the stamina consumption on the combo to the point it's basically useless. Since then:\n\n* Heavy punches consume more stamina \n* You now have to run for a set amount of time before you can initiate a heavy punch\n* Hitboxes were changed in some way that made heavy punches useless and turned dropkicks into missiles that could knock multiple people out. It's nearly impossible to effectively heavy punch when you factor in the last change and this one\n* Climbing speed has been changed for the worse\n\nIf you pop in their official Discord, check the feedback channel and you can see videos of people comparing the before and after. The game just feels god awful to play compared to how it used to a few months ago.",

I cant even have fun playing casually anymore because theres people queing up together and fixing games so their friends win. Its just become a total waste of time even logging in. \n\nI liked what they added to the game but it feels way too late. The game got pushed to release too early with very little content and this is kind of the result. People waited for months for real updates and it took them almost a year to add half the content they promised. \n\nYou can also add the fact that the skins are mostly bad and pretty much for free, for the most part. Players dont want to wait three months for premium skins, outside of battlepasses. That and theres no way they can sustain any success by not making or hardly making any money on a live service game. \n\nI hope PS5 will be a successful endeavor but I kind of doubt the game will be around much longer, unless its a massive hit there. They shouldve never done an exclusive deal in the first place tbh. Their best option of staying open might be to get absorbed into epic and have a Fortnite collab.\n\nOh, and I totally forgot that they spent months working on the uno game and not fixing anything else. That certainly didnt help.",

I feel like Recreate wants to just make these moves more impactful when you actually time and land them opposed to people just chasing each other's tails spinning circles back to back spamming heavy punches hoping one will slip up and knock the other out XD",

I could say people post clips on here to gather a few karma points and click, no?\n\nJust seems to be a bit of a joke to share something that was funny and to feel apart of the community only to be shunned away by reddit mods. I never excessively spammed this and it was never to just gather clicks etc. IT was to feel apart of the community and share a loved project with everyone.\n\nMaybe it's just me but this seems crazy.  \nNever in my time have i seen a game reddit ban a video on their own game before as if it's also not self promo for you in the same way as it is for myself? Bonkers.  \n  \nAtleast now i know where it stands.  \nGood day.",

            "body": "Quickly came up with three maps during some gameplay last night. \n\nSandcastle contest pretty straight forward, you collect buckets of wet sand to bring back to build sand castles. Major obstacle is the water, small waves flow up into the collection zone and every handful of seconds that will wash everyone out to see who gets caught. A lifeguard NPC will throw life preservers at anyone in the water as an added challenge. \n\nSimilar to the train and arcade maps, the more sand you collect the bigger the castle the better chance at winning. \n\nOrchard; you collect fruit to get points. There are trees that drop fruit and bins to put said fruit in. The map is divided by a fence that can be climbed or destroyed. Opens up the possibility for classic sabotage. Steal other teams fruits or prevent them from collecting.\n\nFeels like its missing a main obstacle though.\n\nThe mine; similar to the orchard, you collect Ores to gain points to win. This map however varies in elevation, the main obstacle here is a giant hole/chasm in the middle of the ore veins area. On either side of the hole is a constantly spinning pulley elevator, one side goes up, the other down. You grab the ore, go up the elevator, then place the ore in a mine cart that will pass by every few seconds very slowly. \n\nThese are very rough sketches, Im not an artist nor am I a level designer. This was intended as a fun little concept in hopes to promote discussion or other ideas. I will of course accept any criticism on my ideas, im just hoping a dev sees this and maybe it inspires something in them.  ",

How do i get it. Just jump on the discord and ill usually see a ton of people posting about the animal with the code. So yeah!

If they dont change any of it, I really think its just over for me with this game.\n\n  \nSmash as a gamemode is fun the first few times you play it, but if you have seen all the power ups it just becomes kinda tedious to play. It takes forever because of the long loading times between each round and the gamemode is super unbalnced, the first few rounds basically don't matter at all since the point system makes no sense...",

            "body": "I'm not gonna say that you or anyone else is wrong, but people say this or something similar every single patch, and never do I feel the difference. Nor have I seen any other seriously good players comment on it either. \n\nTangent time: take everything said here with an entire shaker of salt. My personal crackhead conspiracy theory is that, on average, lesser skilled players are given an additional incoming & outgoing damage advantage. The players that have problems with stuff like \"knockout duration\", \"physics\", and \"hitreg\" are usually the ones approaching level 100 or recently hit it. I suspect that they got good enough for the game to stop giving them that extra leniency, which coincided with the time the patch dropped. They don't hit as hard anymore and they're down for longer, and they understandably blame the patch. And so every patch, we have the same complaints.\n\nI was that player once, actually, back in September or so. Was level 90 or so, hitting my stride in terms of consistency. A patch drops, and bang, everything felt wrong. I blamed the patch that had dropped the day before. Others reported no change at all. Ever since, I've seen my exact feelings and confusion about this situation expressed by a lot of players; usually by those with a similar level of skill/experience as I possessed at the time. Not by players better than that.\n\nPlaying against newer players, at least in my experience, also points towards the existence of this system. It's always the new guys that will randomly one-bang you with a light punch and put you down for 3 business days. That doesn't happen against 300hr players. Almost all of my weird, \"how the fuck is that fair\" moments happen against really inexperienced players. \n\nThe game also has had the power to individually control the incoming/outgoing damage of individual players since launch: this is what the bot difficulty adjusts. Not their intelligence or ability. Simply just how hard they hit, and how much they resist your hits. It could just as easily be applied to players in a real game.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to give my super long-winded theory as to why you and others might be experiencing gameplay changes. I'm no way asserting this to be certainly true, and if you think I'm wrong, that's entirely fair. But it's food for thought.",

            "body": "*For someone who's played Party Animals for over the last 10 months, spending hundreds of hours on a game that caught my eye and attention- It very well seems that a lot of the community (Even myself) are not happy with recent changes made to the overall QOL and core gameplay. Many may see the discourse/distaste in these changes as \"Annoying\" \"Irritating\" or the idea that many are \"Crying\" what is over a \"Kids Game\". I just want to make something clear: I understand both sides of the community.*\n\n-\n\n-\n\n**There are many people who genuinely don't see this current update as a problem. Going about their everyday Animal Shenanigans and playing the game at a comfortable level. Not batting an eye, or minding much of how the game is slowly but surely progressing, as we near PA's 1 year anniversary. Many feel as if players have been taking the time to learn forbidden commands that the game doesn't normally advertise as a \"way to play\". Let alone, i'm sure many have drawn up conclusions to the idea of these mechanics being \"unfair\", an \"exploitive behavior\" and or \"game breaking\". As they've become a HUGE reason for many to feel under-powered or cheated out of decent, yet fair play matches. But the biggest thing i've noticed is how many are asking: \"What's so special about fling & superman punching?\"; \"Why are we complaining over anything?\"; \"I'm not affected, so this is just people being cry babies\".**\n\n**-**\n\n**-**\n\n**You see, this becomes more than just what many are arguing as an**   \n**\"exploit\" or \"cheating\" and absolutely should be removed from the game entirely to weed out or get rid of players who used those mechanics. If anything, everyone who's learned how to do it, believe it to be a tool of PROBLEM SOLVING. Like i've mention in the discord: If i'm being edge guarded during a 2v1, or an enemy or who wont get off my back, how do i overcome this? I climb up and try to time my fling ability I practiced learning how to do, and I hop over an enemy who could easily defeat me or take advantage of my character and prevent me from continuing through the round. In a team score, the game could be on the verge of either a win or a major loss. Tossing yourself and getting to the ball, and or side of the map that requires your attention, could be a massively opportunistic moment to turn the game around and pull through-- based on skill. If in fluffy redemption, A team is winning against the other side, and their train is getting progressively further from the opposing team who's losing, Getting to a high point, flinging to the other side, and solving the problem of how to stop the enemies train-- has now been solved and comes at such a high risk, high reward. Same thing with the start of ANY match. What if you're being dogpiled by everybody in the server? Fling or superman punch yourself out of the crowd, regain, recollect-- and think of a way to tackle the opponents head on and kick animal butt.  What I want everyone to jest is that using these tools, comes at such a rate of almost dooming yourself 95% of the time, and ACTUALLY succeeding only 5% of the time. Like I said before, High risk, High reward.**\n\n**-**\n\n**-**\n\n**-**\n\n**I'm trying to provide reasons for why Flinging and SuperMan punching are/have been tools that could effectively help players achieve issues or levels of random encounters that can prove to be difficult. If these tools at their rawest form, are truly an issue with players who aren't a fan of them, Party Animals developer's (RECREATE), should implement an official mechanic tied to a tutorial/mission that requires players to get from point a to point b using said commands/combos. Even if they decided that this tool could be implemented in a game mode, they also need to consider the issue of wake-up times, the fact that stamina depletion has been increased, and everyone feels less ragdolly/sporadic, and more roboticized and dumbed down.** \n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nIf the decision to remove the Macros was implemented during the games first 1-3 months of release, I could totally get behind this change. A foreign amount of people who learned on their own, or even by tutorials on YOUTUBE of how to pull off these advanced move, it would've only been so miniscule. But now that a vast amount of players take note to these tools that the game ALLOWED them to do up until this past update in July... It feels like a slap to the face to many who've been accustomed to the already enjoyable and set gameplay-- ON TOP-- of learning the advanced mechanics as well. By no means, is anyone who is under the belief that this patch was a good idea, are inclined to believe they are WRONG and should feel ashamed or different. Your opinion stands tall and true, so please stick with it if you believe otherwise. But people who want the game reverted back to its original state: Deserve to be understood and heard too.\n\n  \n***(This post is made for others to gather insight on why this update has upset many players in a big way. If you choose to reply, please keep it constructive and informative. In order for all of us to learn how either side of the fence feels due to the recent patch)***",

I don't think the developers really ever intended for people to start really going balls to the wall trying to master every trick and tactic and turn the game into an absolute sweat fest that from what I can gather on the official Discord server for Party Animals, EVERYONE was sick of the game and generally unhappy dealing with constant players wiping lobbies or using hidden techs to just slam a game down the drain and force it to end super quick without even giving them a chance to play a bit. \n\nPersonally I've never minded any game people choose to become more skilled or competitive in...IF there is an ACTUAL ranking system or competitive or \"Comp scene\"...but Party Animals has NEVER had any of this to begin with...every win doesn't add to any counter or total or ascending a leaderboard...it's legitimately just a temporary victory screen and ya move onto the next. Not to mention everyone who ends up taking the time to sweat so hard over this game just harbors the worst possible attitudes as they'll trash talk on mics/text chats in the end screen or mid-game even...and then when the \"Goofy haha funny winner circle photo moment\" occurs they just legitimately space out vibe checking the camera and don't even try to mess around before the shutter clicks on the camera....it's just PURE pain in the ass and made many people who wanted the game to remain casual/light-hearted start to just leave the game like a sinking ship and ONLY dip a hand back into if we felt so obligated to with battle passes or skin drops so we don't miss out...which is super unhealthy for a player base when the only reason why you bother to even touch the game anymore is just to increase your wardrobe of limited time cosmetics.",

            "body": "A ranking system would be genuine. A way to develop some sort of network of players who want to compete in a seriously competitive manner. I dont think that idea is bad nor is it something i feel like a lot of people would be opposed to. I genuinely also believe that as much as many want to believe that the game is not suppose to be crazy or advanced in some form or way this game DOES HAVE competitive TWITCH RIVALS/Cash cups for people who are not only content creators and live streamers, but for those who are avid on their progression and skills on PARTY ANIMALS. I think that speaks volumes on the fact that getting good and moving past that casual play style & level of normal gameplay, is definitely expected by the developers. Albeit though, maybe not so much of the remove macros that were originally in the game were legitimately suppose to be in there to begin with? Regardless, I respect and appreciate your take. I believe although, every game is going to eventually start finding itself where players who are adamant about consistency, are going to get better and better at the game. It doesnt mean that casual and care free enjoyers arent suppose to enjoy the game. But its almost always expected that games like these are going to have many individuals who want to surpass a basic skill level. Were almost nearing a year, and many players have been investing time into it since September. \n-\n-\nAlbeit though, I really feel as if a ranked mode with these macros re-enabled, and a leaderboards system would sit perfectly. Its very obvious that theres a scene of people who are not huge fans of this recent update, all through out discord, and even reddit & forums. BUT, the same goes for people who dont mind the new update. Weve also peeped that China servers & Brazil are all not very happy with the game right now either, and China is their main player base. \n-\n-\n-\nthere needs to be a middle lining for both casual and ranked/competitive players.",

            "body": "Also, people are unhappy with the fact that the movement system, the stamina drain, and everyone feeling SO restrictive to their play style whether you decide to use fling or not has now been reduced and is absolutely not enjoyable anymore. They killed so many elements that made the game amazing, even if you didnt take the time to learn any of the macros they removed.\n\nAnd I will say this Moderation, An emoji/chat timer, and making it more easy for players to avoid bad interactions there should be a new system to get that crap outta the game or servers. I dont even bother keeping voice chat on, and i recommend you do the same thing. You dont need to listen to toxic folk who make way at eating you or anyone elses good vibes and mental away. Its not fair to you, and if you can block as many people as possible.\n-\n-\n-\nAnd second, there is always going to be a difference between Try hard Sweaty toxics and Skillfully Advanced & Well rounded players. I say this because the majority who are avidly speaking up on this matter are people who dont want everyone limited to just a bare bones, super dry, and an awful moveset. Its no longer fun when you end up draining all the momentum and energy that takes place during each match, and reduce us to absolute walking slugs with barely any effort to make the games Woo-Factor remain intact and memorable. Its just so cut and dry and quite literally, in my opinion, a slap to the face. Its not cool to have made such big changes, especially this far on. There needs to be a compromise for both sides.",

So people complaining about others knowing tech is so irritating. Its like yall just want the game to be lame as shit.

It has had multiple iterations, years of experience existing as a game, even as MULTIPLE games, years of balancing, amazingly intuitive and responsive controls, and low to no amount of randomness. It has a massive audience and fan base, much more money behind it.\n\nParty Animals is just a re-skin of Gang Beasts. Both games have physics based gameplay and fairly inconsistent knockouts and hitboxes. PA has so much RNG with the map mechanics and people being able to interfere by throwing objects after K/O. There is so little \"skill\" involved in winning rounds and games because of all this. Even people using these \"techniques\" admit they aren't hard.\n\nI'd rather spend my time practising on games or hobbies that make sense to be competitive on, like R6S, for instance. It's one of the toughest games with lots of competition and even cheaters on all consoles, yet I improved my rank and K/D season to season. Another game I play to improve in is Elden Ring, I even do challenge builds.\n\nBut you keep thinking anyone cares that you win a few games of Party Animals, lmao. I don't even play any more, quite honestly, when I realised the devs don't really care about the game and keep pumping out paid skins but 0 maps.",

            "body": "That sword cuts both ways my friend. Its not a comp game where everyone needs to learn a tech, so following that logic why remove something to in the name of balance?\n\nAlso as I said before flinging is not an automatic win button like youre making it seem. It shines for traversing the environment most and when used defensively.\n\nAlso Im gonna attack your premise some more, its not a self evident truth that the game is inherenlty meant for everyone to be on an even playing field. \n\nTheres weapons on the map that provide an unfair advantage, there players trying to kill only you with objects after they die. Thats an uneven playing field. Theres map hazards thats an uneven playing field. \nPeople with wired connections will be able to react faster than those without. Thats an uneven playing field. \n\nOf all those things listed which seems have more fairness and accessibility to this even playing field you mentioned? \n\n1.) players spending time to learn to fling if they want to \n\nOr \n\n2.) get a wired connection, so everyones equal. Dont use any weapons or everyone use weapons for an even playing field. No players are allowed to kill each other with items after death (even playing field). Remove all map hazards to make the game an even playing field. \n\nThis game design philosophy of forcing equity/an even playing field is bunk. Instead the equal opportunity to learn more skillful techniques, if the player wants is better. \n\nThis philosophy of forcing an even playing field does not make for good design choices and it alienates players who dedicate time getting good in the name of helping players who are more casual and the kicker is those casual players dont care if flinging is available to be used and if they do and they can learn. Although I would argue someone who complains about game balance and wants things changed is not exactly a *casual*\n\nInstead I think we should have the approach of: *what is fun for players* like Gabe Newell talks about for his design philosophy in making the Half Life games. \n\nNot this focus on balance in an E for everyone game. Its like when players complain about realism in a game to justify balance changes. No player cares about whats realistic we care about whats fun. \n\nBottom line flinging isnt an auto win button, you should stop acting like it is. Flinging was an acceptable form of skill expression available to everyone and this war on skill in video games is bunk af and so is your support for it. I do appreciate the counter points you provided though.",

The game reads off how many seconds your character is in the forbidden area before the game initiates an insta kill for you even attempting to avoid gameplay with the other players. \n\nSo it mustve realized you were attempting to hide within the confides of the conveyor as you were double jumping and edging the insides back and forth.

I'll be nice IRL if I gotta...but the online gaming community most times is an atrocious cesspit that really deserves no respect most of the time with their natural attitudes they take to the games without even being provoked. \n\nIf anyone wonders why this game in particular is dying or starting to struggle it's simply because people kept ignoring the positive minority that wanted to keep the game more humorous and not taken so seriously competitive, I'll happily lend a hand in making this game more deader than a doornail so then everyone can start whining and moaning about \"Oh why does nobody wanna play this game anymore?\".",

            "body": "Sincerely, I don't know why people complain so much about everything! I love this game and I think it's one of the best on Steam right now.\n\nThe single problem this game presents, in my opinion, is having to be always online, even though the game can be played locally. I guess this is a choice to minimize hacks and exploits, but there could be a better alternative, as I never want to see this game gone, it's too good to be lost to time.\n\nOther than that, I don't see any problem with the game. Everything works great and the dev messages and ui elements makes it pretty clear how and what everything does. The controls are great, the music are great, the levels are fun and the animals themselves are beyond cute and funny.\n\nAll skins can be either won through achievements and challenges, level up, events or purchased with cookies, coins and nemo bucks, all of which gained by simply playing the game. No real necessity to use real world money, unless you lost an event and really want a especific skin in the last minute, but even that is not really an option most of the times. There is no pay to won aspect or option in this game. You simply play and have fun. Plus, new animals, skins, and levels release all the time, and new game modes have recently released as well.\n\nIt's a shame more people are not experiencing this gem, it quickly became one of my favorite games ever since the demo, and that's coming from someone that's been into games since the 90s. Hope it grows in the hearts of people in time! Just watch the videos on Party Animals youtube channel for  the events and new characters and you'll love it already for how cute everything is!",

            "body": "I bought it at launch and have been playing it solo since the 2020 demo. I highly highly recommend it! It's one of the most fun games ever for me, and that's coming from someone who's into games since the 90s and not even a fan of online multiplayer games in general.\n\nThe skins are earned by simply playing the game:\n\n-You can gain them by leveling up (happens as you play);\n\n-From achievements and weekly challenges which are super fun (hitting x animals with a fish, playing with a feline animal in x matches, etc);\n\n-From special events and partnerships (happen all the time);\n\n-From the store, that can be bought with cookies and coins earned by simply playing, with luck pulls on a egg slot machine or with real money, which is something I have never done and never felt the need to, although I certainly intend to to support the developers.\n\nNew skins are added frequently and new game modes have been added recently.\n\nThere hardly is any toxic player, at least in my time playing it, and the rare few that comes up can be muted and ignored. Sometimes when someone like that enters the game sayng stupid stuff, all the animals in the match teams up to punch him (I certainly did it already, and happens more than one would imagine, it's guaranteed laugh!)\n\nAfter you finish a match, you have a couple of seconds to take a picture and save it on your computer, and all the players will fight to be centered in the shot or to appear funny on the photo.\n\nThe matchmaking is pretty fast. It used to be even faster at launch, but even today it takes less than one minute to find a game. While it finds the match, you can save additional copies of the photo taken and add the animals from the last match as friends. To connect with any of them is super easy as well, just click over them on your friends list and send an invite to join your game.\n\nThe levels and the music are fun, and the animals themselves are beyond cute and funny!\n\nThe game is so much fun that even when I lose, I generally keep laughing my spirit out of my body.\n\nTo add to all that, the game even has local split screen, which is something that I missed so much in games.\n\nIf you like laughing your life out, I highly recommend this game. It quickly became one of my favorites!",

This specific Pawer combination is already rare to come by, and the chance of the final map being Ice Breaker is only 1/3, plus you also need to get lucky and spawn with a crossbow at the beginning and not another type of ranged weapon. I think having this kind of substantial advantage is a fair reward considering how many stars have to align in your favor to get to this point, not to mention it still doesn't guarantee you a victory (you almost fell into the water in the video which would have forced you to abandon the gun). To me it seems already well balanced.",

On top of that, you would instantly get targeted for using it, and would then probably stop using it. That's why you rarely see the Platinum skin. A lot of people have it, but it immediately paints a target on your back. So many have opted not to use it.\n\nOne thing they could do is unlock the level cap of 100, and offer EXP bonus purchases with cookies. People could display their actual level (some prouder than others), and have somewhere for all those excess cookies to go. Some people would be level 300+ at this point if it wasn't capped. It wouldn't prevent skin purchases (a source of revenue), but would allow players to spend their cookies and display their achievements.\n\nWhile they're very generous with what they give to players, at the end of the day, they need to make money. They have server bills, employee costs, licensing costs, salaries, etc. Doing anything to clip their revenue stream probably wouldn't happen.",

            "body": "I think that the purpose of the collab is for devs to encourage players to support both games, I think that's nice in theory. That said, the execution was poorly done for anyone who bought the games on console before the collab was announced. I backed Sandrock back in 2020, and loved that Nemo and Macchiato were in that game when PA was released and I realized the easter egg. When this collab was announced however I was disappointed that as a consumer supporting both properties, I was denied a code due to my console choice and time frame of purchase. I think it is unreasonable to ask those who have already paid for both games to pay for Sandrock again on the 'correct' platform.\n\nNow in regards to your specific question OP, if they are not planning on buying PA now or ever then they should share the codes, as this way they can help fellow gamers, sharing in the attempt that the devs made in sharring in each other's success with this collab. But, and especially on reddit, the 'cozy game' communities are very rude and impatient, as the time and money has already been given to Sandrock, why not give the code to someone who gives the same to Party Animals, all in the spirit of boosting both games? It isn't a scam as the code was still given out to the players, it doesn't matter which player uses it at that point, at least imo.",

As said before, the idea of supporting both games is what a Collab should aim to do, I mean if Nemo appeared as a follower in Cult of the Lamb that would be a perfect example, but the Sandrock Devs just used it as a damn cash grab. \n\n1. Sandrock players got the Party Animals Collab without having to pay anything. We should have as well.\n\n2. We are being taken advantage of as a community because they think we will do anything for a skin and the PA fan base is much bigger than MTaS. So if we all buy the game, they almost triple profit.\n\n3. The Sandrock Devs themselves tweeted that they would try and win the Pensky Game Key. This means that one more person had to buy the game because they already knew the answer.\n\n4. We have to play ten hours of a game we probably don't even like just to be able to access the code. They only did this so we can't refund and they get more money.\n\n5. The Sandrock community is much more toxic than us. Because of the Collab, Sandrock could be gaining more attention. The next thing you know, people associate us with that toxic community, like how stupid looking animals are often associated with competitive players.\n\n6. If someone is an Xbox player that already had Sandrock, they then have to buy the game again on 'the correct platform' and replay the first ten hours. This in general is just unfair and shouldn't be an issue.",
