submission,BV-UM-VB,PSA: Asus GPU tweak causing weird graphical issues and crashes in Worms Ultimate Mayhem,"Hi, thought i would make a PSA about this since i haven't seen it mentioned anywhere.

If you're trying to play Worms Ultimate Mayhem in Windows 11 and you're getting this weird graphical issue and or are experiencing crashes **Asus GPU tweak 3** might be the issue. Try uninstalling it and running the game as normal and everything could be fine.

I suppose this issue could show itself if you are running some other kind of GPU overclocking software like MSI Afterburner for example.

  
Big kudos to Team17 Support on Discord who helped me solve this issue üëè

comment,Callinater,PS5 Armageddon anniversary physical edition. Any missing features that'll make me regret spending on this one?,"AFAIK Armageddon Anniversary Edition is based on version 3.7 on PC. As such it's missing all of the features that 3.8 introduced. Additionally, this also means that the game is locked at around 48fps as that was the highest framerate supported by the game's engine before 3.8 introduced tweening to make the game play as smoothly as your monitor could allow. This means that it can feel incredibly rough if you're used to the PC version.

If nothing else, the switch port is probably worth it as a secondary version of the game if its convenient setup appeals to you and you don't have a steam deck. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though. The controls also take a lot of getting used to and you can't rebind them. Though to be fair, you can't rebind controls on the PC version either.

You can only use like 20 different default weapon kit for a match where there are like 3 uzis, 2 shotguns, 6 bazooka for example.

2. Do you need to unlock weapon kits (or each weapon?) in the training/ campaign mode like on ps1/Dreamcast?

comment,Fungruel,Ammo loot drop,"I remember laughing so hard the first time I actually used the Holy Hand Grenade at the ""Hallelujah"" and then the size of the explosion it made

The best experience I had the first time using a weapon was the Banana Bomb though. I was sleeping over at my friend's house and we were playing on his computer and we used to make up our own games/rules inside other games. So we were playing Armageddon and our custom rule for this round was neither of us could attack for the first 10 or 15 turns, I can't exactly remember 

So we spent the first ten-fifteen turns using the blowtorch/drill to build cave systems and place girders. We were stupid fifth graders just having fun so we weren't really taking it seriously so I decided to use the Banana Bomb as a joke. Neither of us had used it before so when I threw it into a cavern that had opened up in our cave system due to other explosions since we were allowed to attack, and it blew up and split into five smaller bombs that also had large explosion areas, and totally wrecked the majority of our caves, we both just started dying of laughter. Neither of us had ever used it before because it sounded so stupid but when I used it just for a joke it ended up being the most powerful weapon for the job

We ended up trying a few other weapons we thought were stupid that night too. The grandma's and the sheep I remember, both of which both of us had previously dismissed. There were probably others too. I think that's the night we found out how useful the Home Run Bat could be too

Anyways, sorry for the ramble. This post just brought up some decades old memories that I haven't thought about in a LONG time",2024-10-05 21:36:52,5,

Never heard a proper explanation as to why though. I looked up footage of the game and the movement and physics don't seem to be emphasised as much in HoW compared to Worms, and the levels themselves seem to be designed very differently, with less hazards and insta-kill water. Though I hear it's more in depth in other ways, like having a class and ranking system and whatnot.

  
With there being an official remaster in development, I'm quite interested in maybe picking it up. Though I'm not sure it'll scratch the same itch as Worms Ultimate Mayhem - looks like it plays very different.

comment,piat17,Anyone here played Hogs of war? How does it compare to the efforts of the 3D Worms games?,"it's a different game, despite both being turn-based artillery-style game in a 3D setting, for a variety of reasons. I really like Hogs of War mostly for the atmosphere and humor, which is a parody of classic world war settings (unlike Worms that just uses different themes across the setting used for matches and missions). The dub is great, although I mostly think about the local one made for my country.

One major difference that makes the game memorable for me is the campaign, which is a completely different experience than Worms: while in the Worms games you have a set of mission that you at most can decide to finish quickly or fully to get customisation rewards (in the 3D ones, trophies in Worms 3D and Forts, par times in Worms 4/Ultimate Mayhem), Hogs of War is more or an actual journey where you use rewards after every mission to rank up your 'hogs', choosing classes and seeing them improve. Different classes indeed have different weapons and as they rank up they get new and better weapons, so you need to choose well to get the all-rounder team required to beat the more complicated missions (or you can choose to focus on certain specialization if you're inclined to do so and know what you're doing). Of course, this works because throughout the campaign, you're always playing with the same team, but be wary: the game has a permadeath mechanic as well. If too if too many hogs die during a mission, some of them will die permanently and will be replaced by recruits, losing any of the ranks you assigned to your old veterans. If you are not skilled (I am not) it can make things very difficult very fast, but the satisfaction of beating the latter stages of the campaign is incredible.

There are also a lot of other differences, especially gameplay-wise, but as far as my opinion goes the campaign and atmosphere are the two major reasons why it's distinct enough from 3D Worms to stand on its own and be worth a try.

One thing: if possible, avoid the PC version. That version is incredibly broken (among other things, enemy AIs cannot move their hogs), and the digital copies available on current stores unfortunately do nothing to fix it up.",2024-10-01 22:29:47,4,

Apart from the fact that you're (at the very least) firing bazooka rounds and/or throwing grenades at eachother, pretty much everything else is different. Movement is different, I would say less smooth than Worms tbh, but it does add to the suspense. The environment is different and has different qualities, for instance water is not insta-kill but just drains your health while your hog swims to the nearest shore, there are minefields (which certain classes can ""see"", and others can't), there's slippery terrain, all kinds of turrets, shelters. Each hog carries their own weapons, instead of having a sort of hive-loadout (Worms) where all worms share the same weapons. Not saying one is better than the other, just different, in a lot of ways.

I would say, if you enjoy Worms 3D or 4:UM, definitely give HoW a shot. It's one of my most fond memories from the PSX days tbh, and I have a working ROM on my PC atm, because I love to play it every now and then, I think that says enough!",2024-10-02 10:45:54,2,

* Upon selecting them, use the cursor to move them to the position you wish
* Your worm can not move in this state till the girder is placed or you select a different weapon that allows you to move your worm
* Left and Right control the angle of the girder (from 0¬∞ to 180¬∞, in \~22¬∞ intervals.)
* The Girder has two lengths. To switch between the two, you need to do a full 180¬∞ rotation in either direction to swap to the other length (Or in other terms, the girder can switch between lengths when pressing left or right when it's fully vertical, depending on what rotation it's in.)
* To place the Girder, the following requirements must be met:
   * The Girder can not be in/overlapping any land
   * The Girder can not be inside of a worm
   * The Girder can not be in/overlapping any obstacles, items or traps
   * The Girder can not be placed too far away from the Worm that is placing the Girder
* Upon placing a girder, your turn ends and you have a couple of seconds to move much like how you are able to move after firing a weapon

Again, I haven't played the Switch version, but I did wanna give the extra info since the Girders can be confusing on how to use for newer players.",2024-10-03 05:16:13,3,

submission,glow162,Which Worms game has the most online players these days? (and which platform?),"Hey all, so i recently got the new(ish) Worms W.M.D. Mobilize game for Android (and on my iPad), and was pretty impressed with it.

(I guess this game has been out all over the world for over a year, but it's pretty new here in the U.S.)

I was excited to play online matches with my friends, but they never wanna play lol; and i haven't been able to make any matches via quick match

Which is a shame because in some ways I think this is one of the best Worms games to date.

I also see that Armageddon just recently got an anniversary edition on consoles, but I'm seeing people say they can't find matches with that either.

So without any further rambling lol:

Which Worms game are all of the Worms players playing these days?

And for witch platform?

I was about to just guess it would be Armageddon on PC via Steam (which might be the single only version of any Worms game that I don't own), but before I buy like my 5th version of that game, I figured I'd make sure there's actually other players currently playing online.

I really miss the days of being able to boot up even Worms World Party on Dreamcast and find online matches instantly, no problem;

and not many people had a Dreamcast, much less WWP and SegaNet along with it, yet that scene was absolutely popping compared to the desolate, playerless landscape of any modern Worms game I own.

Surely there's an online scene on one of these games, on one of these platforms, right?

Thanks in advance fellow Worms fans!",2024-10-01 14:02:09,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/1ftoul8/which_worms_game_has_the_most_online_players/

comment,piat17,Do the Steam and GOG versions of various Worms games (specifically Armageddon) have cross-platform compatible multiplayer servers?,"In Worms Armageddon you will be able to play with other players regardless of the game version you choose. Unlike the recent Worms games, WA's multiplayer is provided by the WormNET server, and essentially all versions (GOG, Steam, even patched CDs) can connect to the server to play together with other people (as long as the versions are compatible, at most, but I haven't tested that thoroughly: for Steam and GOG you generally won't have to think about that). This also means that you can play online without needing GOG Galaxy installed as well.

For other Worms games on GOG the answer is generally no. Unfortunately (much to my sadness) Worms WMD for instance does not support cross-play. It requires GOG Galaxy because it uses the Galaxy API to handle connections, but the game has not been set in such as way that GOG players can connect with Steam players (who use a Steamworks-based network setup instead). For some reason, you *can* interact across the two platforms because the world chat in the main menu features both GOG and Steam players... but that's about it.

As for other Worms games, generally either the online multiplayer was stripped out of the GOG version (like Worms Ulitimate Mayhem) or the online multiplayer is present as it was back then but not really updated like WA was and with the servers long gone (like Worms 2). The exception is Worms World Party Remastered which I think uses Galaxy as well for multiplayer, but since it's the only game in the series I don't own I can't say whether it supports cross-platform, and I would recommend choosing WA over it anyway.

**TL;DR:** Worms Armageddon supports cross-play (well, it's less cross-play and more everyone uses the same server to play together, but it's a technicality), you can get it without concern. Other Worms games generally do not for various reasons.",2024-09-30 10:47:52,2,

Funnily enough I had a forerunner to Worms on the Amiga called Scorched Earth which was a very silly tank artillery game with silly voices so this whole trip down memory lane of British gaming is amazing for me and probably others too.

I only first discovered Worms when I was talked into co-buying a PS1 at university as an all round after the pub home arcade experience.  Never regretted it although studying often went out the window!

Still, I was expecting them to celebrate the game with a little bit more effort than basically re-releasing the same game again and asking 25e for it.

comment,Jarzka,what's everyone's opinions on anniversary edition so far?,"I think the reason is a combination of both low-resolution graphics but also the decades old game engine.

The game is still likely using the same old game engine from the 90s (created originally for Worms 2), which was designed for much smaller resolutions / screens than we use today and does not support zooming (this is the case even with the PC version containing the latest improvements). The only way to ""zoom in"" is to lower the game resolution, which makes things a bit blurry on big screens.",2024-09-27 04:58:38,5,

There are several schemes in WA that people play that are entirely focused on how skilled you are at moving through stages with the rope at high speed. And that's what I've played the most these years.

And that sucks. So I am kinda tired of hyping on new Worms games when I have been systemically disappoined with each of them.

With this new Anniversary Edition, they could have made sooo much more, but they did the bare minimum to milk our wallets. Sure, they might improve the game in the future with patches and whatnot, but I am not going to lend a company my money for an unfinished product, I am so over it.

F that, that tipped me over the edge and had to pipe up in their favor. 

I just wanted to be a voice that says ‚Äúhey thanks! I love the game‚Äù cause those comments are 1 in a thousand. Has nothing to do me making me look good, and they make themselves look plenty bad. I don‚Äôt have to do anything to show that. It‚Äôs just the culture in general is in a sad state of chronic negativity and entitlement and I don‚Äôt want to be a part of that. 

I‚Äôm having a blast with the game. Pre ordered the physical cart too! To read that team 17 doesn‚Äôt deserve your money for this game is an insult across the board and jumping to an extreme ‚Äúblack‚Äù in the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not black or white‚Äù realm.  But sure, I‚Äôm the offender here??

There‚Äôs a difference of having an opinion and trying to smear. If it‚Äôs ok for other people that ‚Äúhave an opinion‚Äù than so it is for me too.",2024-09-28 11:43:56,1,
comment,KaiserGX,what's everyone's opinions on anniversary edition so far?,"Then again this is something people are paying for. It's not a gift, people have a right to complain or expect more. Just like I have the right to say for me it's worth the money to play the game but not worth it for the physical edition because I don't want all that other crap that comes with it for double the price.

I'm one of the people that is just glad to have the game on Switch period but I will say I thought the game would at least be at a higher resolution. Everything looks as blurry as the original did. That and not being able to change controls as well. I can deal with not being to zoom in since I think it's fine how it is.

This is just something I'm going to say personally... there are a lot of people that just complain for the sake of complaining yes... but I try treating people as an individual and not lump them into a side based on the actions of other people. These people aren't the same people, and fellow worms fans.",2024-09-29 19:25:18,2,

The biggest issue in W:A with zooming in and out is that it breaks the game chat window, as text get converted into images, so zooming is out of the question.

Atleast you should have the ability to decide how big everything is via changing the view resolution prior to combat.",2024-10-01 08:16:51,1,

comment,StepS_,Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition is now available on Switch,"Because there is no reason it should be on PC, as the most updated version of the game is already available on Steam and GOG.

In fact, this Edition is based on an older version of the game from 2013 which does not support the numerous gameplay features and fixes from the [v3.8 update](https://www.tus-wa.com/?topic=32795) released in 2020, such as [extended game options](https://worms2d.info/Game_scheme_file#Extended_options) and support for more than 50 FPS in-game. There is nothing particularly new in this release that couldn't previously be achieved with existing software / addons, and the actual new additions hardly matter in practice.

On top of that, while it is now easier to set up online games, there is no cross-platform support. This will lead to the eventual decline of the playerbase, as has been the case with every previously released modern Worms game so far (where not even Steam/GOG/Epic users could play together). Releasing it on PC in this state would be damaging to the existing Armageddon community, which is still very active and heavily connected via mods, recorded games, custom maps and other things that are either absent or would be quite problematic to support in this new Edition. And while most people could simply ignore it, it would inevitably lead to less players online, at the same time creating bad PR for the game due to the lack of meaningful updates that actually matter - such as higher-resolution sprites with zooming/scaling support as mentioned in other posts here.

Now of course, it would be nice to get all the features back in sync on all platforms, via some sort of collaboration. The new UI is a good example of that. However, as of right now, this Edition is not the answer.",2024-09-27 13:05:26,2,

I liked the water dynamic in Battlegrounds, but overall I found it to be very unclear and overwhelming (visually) at certain times. A little bit too much dynamics with the different types of worms as well. The fast one, the fat one, the brainiac.

W.M.D. took a few steps back in that sense. That's what I mean by ""original"" Worms feel. 

A few new features like the buildings and vehicles, and of course some new weapons. But a solid Worms game in its core.

If you want to go even further back to its origins, you should look into Armageddon.

However since you mentioned Battlegrounds I assume you're playing on Xbox or PlayStation.

","As a massive fan of the original worms, on what I think was probably a PS1, what's the most similar modern equivalent, in terms of both style/game-play and also weapons (Nothing too crazy.  Banana bombs and Sheep were the ultimate back in the day).

Ideally, it'd be available on the switch to play with my son on the go, but we have a PS4 and PC too if it helps.

I have Worms W.M.D and the graphics are a bit more cartoony, but the weapons are pretty similar if limited to old school ones and it seems pretty similar with the right customisations.

Also, as a side note, If there a list somewhere of the exact Worm 1 weapons load out so I can customise W.M.D accurately.  e.g. UZI and shotgun seem limited by default in WMD, but I don't think they used to be.

Oh and 1 thing W.M.D seems to lack is Banzai (SP?) mode. Is that available anywhere?  It was also way more hectic and fun with the bigger splash ranges.

comment,internetkreep,The Bot AI in WMD is rigged af.,"In skirmish you can adjust the AI-level. In campaign, yeah you can't change that. 

But tbh, I've been playing for a while now and I don't find max-AI very challenging. I think if you practice a bit (especially ranked/online) your skills will improve fast and AI will become dumber in comparison.

Also, getting better at Worms in general is a trial and error process. Leaving yourself open to shotgun/bazooka shots could be considered a mistake. Always think about your retreat before you execute your attack. If no safe retreat is possible, determine if the attack is worth the consequences.

Recently, my friend and I bought Worms WMD on Steam to play together online. Everything worked pretty well for the first few days. Yesterday, I discovered that this game has a Steam Workshop where there are custom hats and maps created by the community, so I downloaded several with the intention of trying them out with my friend. However, when I tried to start a game and invited my friend, he got a network connection error, and the same happened when he invited me. The strange thing is that I could join public games, and so could he, but when we tried to join the same game, we got the error.

Then we tried both adding a custom map from the workshop, and we were able to enter, so we thought that we both needed to have the same workshop items to play. But when we put on a custom hat, we started getting the same error again, and the same thing happened when we added more maps. In the end, we gave up and decided to play with nothing customized, just the original game content, but even then, we kept getting the same error, and now we can't play together.

If anyone could help me with this issue, I would really appreciate it.",2024-09-05 16:40:51,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/1f9qzo4/problems_with_custom_maps_and_hats_in_online_games/

For some reason, I distinctly remember being able to unlock, in either W2, Armageddon or World Party, the classic themes from Worms 1 (not redesigned, as-is, with slightly bigger pixels, and the actual items from W1).

submission,BallerGiraffes,I can't help but think a VR Worms game would be super interesting and add a new aspect to the classic gameplay,"I haven't fully figured out how this would work, but I was thinking that it would be the standard ""flat"" style Worms game, where you're only moving backwards, forwards, up and down, but from the POV of each Worm. Obviously the view of the full map would be an issue, so something like the Worms having a holographic watch (think VR Pipboy) that you look down at to make their decisions for weapon usage, calling in AirStrikes, and being able to view the map from the standard angle for attack planning would have to happen.

Maybe the launch of the upcoming game will inject some life into the IP. I've been playing Worms Rumble a bunch lately trying to clean up my unfinished PlayStation Platinum trophies and it's making me want more.

I sank tens if not hundreds of hours into online play on that one back then, but didn't really get that hooked to the successor or Battlegrounds on PS4 when I tried them. Now I feel like playing Worms again, but the amount of titles to choose from is a bit overwhelming. What I'm mainly looking for is:

- Gamepad support (Steam Deck / Rog Ally built-in controls)
- Active online community to find matches
- Preferably somewhat console-like / user friendly experience

It's an interesting project, particularly given the bonus content, albeit perhaps not hitting what I would've liked to see (will still be waiting for an update on the PC version with controller support).

comment,piat17,Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition,"Okay, if I do understand which game you are talking about, then the answer is mostly no: the PS3 version shares the name (partially, the PS3 game is called Worms 2: Armageddon) with the game in this trailer, but is actually a completely different game that was based on a different style of the 2D games and is substantially different from the original 1998 Armageddon. That's also why there is a 2 in the name of the PS3 one, it's technically a sequel to the simply named 'Worms' PS3 game (also called Worms HD on 360 IIRC) and the additional subtitle is just there to pay homage to the classic (or marketing points, depending on how you view it).
Worms 2: Armageddon was then re-released on PC with yet another name, Worms Reloaded, which you may have heard about.

You can just look up a gameplay of 1998 Worms Armageddon, a gameplay of the PS3 Worms 2: Armageddon and a gameplay of Worms Reloaded to see how the PS3 game is essentially identical to Reloaded, while 1998 Armageddon is its own thing.

With all of that said... I personally think most games in this series are equally valid, and the gameplay loop variations aside is always the same solid formula, and I don't think that changes for the games I mentioned above.",2024-08-27 19:10:19,5,

I would say stuff that modifies the terrain, but this is worms-inspired... so that's assumed (making earth instead of just destroying it)... but basically breaking all the rules of the game engine... changing gravity, changing player scale (offensively or defensively), change into an animal, limited mind control, teleporting others up (or down)... placing a field to randomize the effect of spells within is, multi-turn effect things... dramatic things like ""this takes health over time, but if you survive hurts the caster... or leaves the victim stronger than you began""... blood magic... sacrificing friendlies to buff the remaining team members...

A spell that causes small projectiles to fall from the sky all over the map's lenght, potentially hitting the user too. Similarly, one that quickly drops tiny projectiles downwards as it travels after being casted/thrown.

Poisoning spell that inflicts damage-over-time poison, and a healing spell that doubles as an instant cure for poisoning.

A spell that creates a small area that automatically slowly damages foes that are within it, likewise there could also be one that slowly heals anyone inside it too.

comment,Salt-Dimension2189,Worms WMD Ranked Matches,"I'll be honest, I now speak for the Armageddon rank, and when I meet anyone below my rank it doesn't do me much. I cannot assume it'll be an easy match, because there are players with plenty experience but new accounts out there. So I approach it as any other match. But to be fair, it'll probably be an easy one.

The point is though, the only way you're going to get better is to get owned a bunch of times. As long as you LEARN from every loss, or every worm lost even, you'll keep getting better. So to the players who immediately surrender when we match; NEVER give away your win. I've won games 1 vs 4 or other seemingly doomed scenarios plenty of times. Of course I've also lost plenty of times. But the point is it ain't over till it's over. When people get the idea they're winning they often get overconfident and/or careless. Also, having one worm vs four opponents puts you in a major advantage turn-wise.

2D - Party, Armaggedon, Reloaded - I never use the Uzi, or the Old Woman (or in Reloaded, the Lightning Strike and Gas Pump). 

Fort - The Priest-Mortar, the basic ballista.

A weapon that feels very useless to me is the petrol bomb in Worms 3D. I like that they tried to translate the fire mechanic in Worms 3D, but inevitably the fact that you can go around flames means that fires do not have the same zoning strength that they had in 2D games.

comment,internetkreep,Which Worms game should i buy?,"I'm genuinely interested in why people love Armageddon so much? If anything I liked Reloaded best. 

I've been playing WMD for the last couple of months. At first I really had trouble getting into it because of the vehicles. But once you learn to play with/against them they're really not as OP as they seem. So all in all WMD is a well-balanced game imo.

But if you don't wanna deal with all that, WMD is your best bet then. Has good additions and were able to appeal to many types of worms fans compared to the non 3D games that came after Armageddon.

Pairs without issue, has the highest compatibility, and thus most every game will display icons for it. Plus, it has almost the same layout as the Switch Pro controller, so it's closer to what you're used to.

I personally use a PS4 controller because I like the layout, but most games don't recognize it so it needs third party tools.",2024-07-11 17:15:57,1,

Worms Ultimate Mayhem was my personal Worms game growing up, I've beaten it more times than I can count. They merged the Worms 4 and Worms 3D campaign together into the Ultimate Mayhem version so you'll get a ton of single-player content out of it. There are also your other modes like Deathmatch, Castle Destruction and stuff. The multi-player is dead on both but the single-player is probably the best out of any Worms game if you don't count modding capability.

Aside from those 2, Worms W.M.D is also solid. They're all really cheap when on sale so you can probably get all or most Worms games for under $20 nowadays.",2024-06-27 15:46:24,1,

I'm all for trying new things, but this was them just trying to cash in on a trending game mode, and it just didn't fit the Worms at all.. Maybe if it was made much more differently, but then again, I don't think these games are made by passionate people anymore.

The board game, from the looks of it, looks super bland and generic too, sadly. I would've loved a great Worms board game. They just use weird looking hexacon discs as the board, with none of it screaming ""Worms"" style. Then the cards. Way too busy with the design, plus lots of text. I don't want to read a lot when playing a simple card game. Lastly, which is not too big of a deal, but the Worms statues are not even colored. I guess you can always paint them yourself, or I believe the finished board game would include colored Worms statues, but not sure.

comment,Plane_Influence_2232,Tell me the story of how you were first introduced to the Worms franchise? ,"A friend of mine in high school circa 1998 had Worms 2 for PC. Our household had only gotten a PC a few months prior, so the world of PC video games to me was a total mystery for the most part. I was a lifelong gamer/addict prior to this and when he showed me Worms 2, there was something about it that hooked me INSTANTLY. I liked it so much that I started to poke around and find information where I could and saw that a sequel was coming out that upcoming summer. 

I bought it on launch day and it's both the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. I had a lot of fun (by ""a lot"" I mean a truly disgusting amount of hours) learning the game, making friends, having long, in-depth conversations with people all over the world. I bought WWP when it come out and bounced back and forth between WA and WWP but eventually went back to WA full-time because it was getting great updates that WWP wasn't getting. 

I've also bought and extensively played every Worms game since, aside from random ones on handhelds or whatever. I'm personally not a fan of the 3D Worms games. 

Reloaded was a huge disappointment in every area except maybe aesthetics. It has severe ""console-itis"" and while it did have some cool new gameplay elements like sentries and lighting strike, et al, it just wasn't fun to play. 

I played a ton of Revolution and Clan Wars, mostly on Playstation but also a bit on Steam. 

I've been playing WMD on Steam since launch. It has its issues but overall I don't think it's terrible. That being said, WA is still the gold standard. It's an absolutely perfect game, especially with the patches over the years. 

Worms Rumble was straight-up trash. 

Anyway, I'm definitely a huge Worms fan and I hope that Team17 is working on something new. I've asked them via social media and said that there's no news to report, which doesn't mean anything. As of right now, WMD has been out for 8 years so it's definitely time for a new game. I just hope that Team17 doesn't screw it up too much. They have a really bad habit of trying to reinvent the wheel with every new game rather than keeping what is good and adding to it. Fog of war buildings? Cool. Crafting? Absolutely terrible. Also, I'd love it if they could actually get the ninja rope right because it's basically perfect in WA.",2024-08-07 01:55:39,1,

comment,kayne2000,Has anybody here completed every single Worms game? and which one is the best and the worst in your opinion?,"Interesting question, and I'd be curious to know the answer to it.

For my part, I haven't, but as someone who usually tries to complete the single player modes, you'll find most of the single player modes will usually have at least a handful of rage inducing moments and challenges you must complete. Worms 4 is probably the only single player mode I've played that wasn't obnoxiously difficult at certain points.

Worms 1, 2, and 3(Armageddon) all famously had some really difficult parts in the single player modes. This usually means some impossible challenge must be completed where you have to get luck to go just right for you and/or the enemy AI is put in the perfect position to screw you every time. This is usually why I never 100% any of these games, though I usually get pretty close.

The AI is something that doesn't improve much either, and relies on ridiculous crack-shots with the bazooka and grenades and air strikes.

The story of the modes, it ranges from some degree of super serious with a side of humor, to full scale comedy. I do not think every game does this perfectly though, with some of the newer entries going full scale British humor. I know there was always British humor in the games, but some of the later games do it to an obnoxious level. But my point is the humor of the storylines is going to vary wildly from game to game.

As for general gameplay, it remains mostly the game throughout. Yes there are tweaks and modifications here and there, but the core gameplay loop never changes and many weapons remain eternal staples in the worms arsenal. 

Why haven't I played every worms game?

In some cases like Worms Royale, battle royale gameplay does not appeal to me though I tried it. In some cases like worms Fort on the ps2, I didn't have a ps2 at the time, though I have the game now and a ps2 I just never came back to it. And by the time the 2010s came around, the series just didn't evolve, it felt like I had seen and done it all after playing virtually every worms game to date. So I took a break, and with the lack of couch multiplayer for friends these days much of the fun of the series was taken away because the AI remains braindead.

Armageddon is obviously the most famous and it deserves it. It was a clear step up from Worms 2 in every conceivable way. WMD is fun but the story mode did not appeal to me and with a lack of friends, I just didn't get into it as I Don't like random multiple matches as online multiplayer is nowhere near as fun in virtually any game today as it was 20 years ago. I also enjoyed the 3-d games. I enjoyed worms 3-d and it's level design and it's hilarious blend of serious and comedic story telling. Worms 4 was also fun for it's create a worm, and it's over the top story telling and the worms legendary dialect.  

All that said I am curious about this new Armageddon release. But overall I think Team17 needs to innovate the series somewhere along the line, it simply seems stagnant, and honestly I think a new 3-d game would be awesome and I never understood the hate those games got. I can understand preferring 2-d to 3-d, but the 3-d games were fine in their own right.",2024-09-27 08:14:23,1,

submission,x0rang3x,Worms Armageddon Project X build by me,"Warning: very long post regarding Worms Armageddon and powerful mod called ‚ÄúProject X‚Äù, TL:DR is at the bottom.

Hello fellow worms fans, today I would like to tell you about things I've been doing for the past year.  
I'll start in the year 2012, when I stumbled upon PX forum and since then my favorite Worms game changed for the rest of my life. For those who don‚Äôt know:

Project X (or PX) is a modification for Worms Armageddon which provides scripters access to various parts of the core gameplay elements, such as the game logic and weapons. Existing object classes can be altered, by overriding their methods to modify their behaviour towards certain events, and new classes can be created to add extra functionalities to the game. 

Project X also adds DirectX 9 rendering support to the game, which grants the user with the possibility to render, rotate and scale 32-bit sprites in real-time.

This opened so many possibilities one can only imagine. During ‚Äúgolden‚Äù era of the mod, people were highly enthusiastic, forum was thriving, everyone tried to contribute by making schemes, weapons and other stuff. This led to the problem that grew exponentially. The mod uses special .pxl (Project X Library) file to implement scripting and inject it to the game engine, but since 90% of players were not familiar with any coding knowledge and mod structure, every minuscule modification was saved as a separate pxl file to avoid conflicts between libraries. Files were updating, new versions, new names, different iterations of same library with just couple lines modified, it quickly became a mess. Full libs folder with every possible scheme and lib was over 2 gigabytes (while typical lib size is no more than 1 Mb). Some libs had more than 7 versions, some schemes required particular set of libs incompatible with the rest, conflicts were unavoidable.

Another problem of the mod is that it only works on an outdated version of WA (3.6.3.1) and is close-source. The developer of the mod (Entuser) is long gone and hasn‚Äôt been seen for many years, while the game was getting new patches and improvements. Combine this with very tedious and finicky mod installation process. This led to a slow but steady decaying of interest and regress in player count. This was the state I left WA and took a long break from it.

About a year ago I decided to remind myself how fun it was with the mod. After many attempts, I got it working, this is when I stumbled upon a small group of people who were still playing quite regularly, had their own telegram chat and somewhat stable build they shared with each other via zip file. But game modes were scarce, since only a few stable schemes were available.

This whole situation inspired me to take action and do something about it. Being no coder at all and working in art field, I never had any experience besides some basic in middle school. I started analyzing all the code snippets, scripts and libraries and in few months I got a hang of it. My plan was to fully reorganize these libraries, get rid of duplicates, solve bugs, make an understandable structure and most importantly, make everything compatible with each other.

Roll many sleepless nights, some math tutorials, few hundred hours of testing with trial and error method, and thousands lines of code. All this leads to today, when I'm finally ready to share my work with everyone. In the TL:DR below is the link to the Dropbox folder where I store everything.

There you can find installation guide along with the all files you might need to get it working. The fore-mentioned libs folder is now only 200Mb, well organized with prefixes in file names, while containing more libraries than was available before, there are more than 70 working schemes, hundreds of maps specifically designed for PX. In our telegram group we're all using my reorganized version for couple months already. There are still some bugs appearing from time to time which is unavoidable because I'm working alone and it's easy to overlook some dependencies and conflicts. The mod is still very tricky to get working, many factors come into play: Windows version, graphics card, screen resolution etc. But once you get it working, there's no denying you will have fun playing with it.
Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. Feel free to ask for telegram link if you would like to join, we play almost daily. Keep in mind that there are many Russians there, but also a few Ukrainians, we tend to keep politics aside and just enjoy our favorite game together. You can also comment here if you experience any problems with getting the mod working. Best regards, 'PX'0rang3.

TL:DR:
Dropbox link to the folder with Worms Armageddon version 3.6.3.1 with Project X mod and installation guide along with fully reorganized libraries and schemes folders I‚Äôve been working on for the past year.

Quality of life and modern game features are usually very important, but I cant get used to the altered feel of modern Worms iterations, even trying my best. In my gaming circle everyone is intimately familiar, or becoming so, with the mechanics. Wind sensitivity, grenade bounce, weapon power, utils... this not only means that our matches on LAN become evenly matched and exciting. It also means that great kills and tricks are appreciated by each other on a deep level. Every turn becomes a show piece, or an embarissing flunk. Our settings schemes are designed to create the best experience for our groups. Nerfing stuff, boosting other things. Our knowledge of the game helps us being in control of the match experience of all instead of everyone learning chaotically, which it often ends up playing a newer title.

So Worms WMD, or any other game can be best I suppose if you stick to it long enough, especially with friends. Personally, I'd love to be able to play Worms 2 on modern systems. But WA is the next best thing.",2024-05-31 12:02:05,1,

Reloaded and Armageddon are very different games which comes down to the physics and arsenal available. To me, they both have value due to being so different from one another.

Uploading custom maps in Reloaded is not complicated, but making them might be if you want to work with alpha channels as well as changing the theme which is only possible with a HEX editor or other third-party tools. Either way, here are examples of what is visually possible in Reloaded: [One](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/595846901588673696/D064B585591C3D79BDF9E3CD51073C0902DAEA74/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false), [Two](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/468671372874441584/906CE5DCEC514588BB58DA9E27B5CC4045DF1B96/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false), [Three](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/631916199048196075/0AC30363D0EAED4E05F8C266BA3F0520979D2AB8/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false), [Four](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/884100108116498819/B9C54291C1E0B0CFA86341321875C15F10AC4016/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false).

Armageddon has an additional advantage in that it is ""the game everyone plays"". Which naturally means it has the most community content and mods available, a lot of which have actually been implemented in the base game over the years so you don't need to do any additional downloading. Take Worms World Party for example, the base game version is technically superior to the base game of Worms Armageddon, but Worms Armageddon has managed to surpass virtually everything World Party offers thanks to mods and community updates.

It's still better than the regular GMOD customer community though, that's for certain (yeah, that's a dumb comparison - an unfinished game against another game's community).

You're free to hold your opinion, I wouldn't object to that, but you still get my point. GMOD community is the true hot garbage ever concieved by the humanity, Rumble is better than that community, despite its limited potential and unfinished nature which doesn't please you in your personal opinion, and respectfully so.

Any Worms game is better than Garry's Mod customer community, even the one that I do support as the Russian all-rounder of the series while you dislike it in your personal opinion.

Also, my biggest concerns right now are that they SHOULDN'T actually make a new game since there are way too many Worms titles (unless it's gonna be ""perfect"", which is subjective and impossible), focusing more on patching, compiling the old titles into collections and possibly making a Worms X Hedgewars crossover.",2024-05-28 04:34:37,1,

comment,piat17,Worms games on GOG?,"I own a few, though I only played some - I've played most of the series on Steam.

**Worms Armageddon** is probably your best choice. It features a online multiplayer community that sticks to it to this day and will probably stay on the long run due to everyone playing on the same server regardless of what store they bought the game from (just be ready to learn a little bit of etiquette if you want to play with randoms, I don't know the specifics well there since I didn't play much but it's basically your standard old game online community that assumes you know how to play, rules, preferred game modes, and so on and so forth). It also has good compatibility thanks to the recent updates despite its age and it is just a complete package. Only thing it misses is native controller support and maybe more elaborate single player, but if you don't care about those, then you're fine.

**WMD** ain't bad and personally it's the 2D game I liked the most, but the problem is that its small online community is all on Steam. The GOG version players can only play with other GOG players (through GOG Galaxy), and as you can imagine there are next to none from what I remember here. This doesn't just mean that you are out of luck if you want to play with randoms, but if you have friends playing the Steam version, then you can't play together at all.

**Worms 2** is basically present on GOG as an archived version of sorts, but in truth there aren't many reasons to prefer it over Armageddon from what I understand... some differences here and there, and I'm sure there's a least one person who prefers it, but most people will recommend Armageddon directly since it's just Worms 2 but better and bigger in most regards. It also does not have modern updates like Armageddon, so there's a chance you need to do some troubleshooting to make it work, too. No idea whethet it's even possible to play it online today.

I can confirm **Worms Ultimate Mayhem** has no online multiplayer on GOG, that part was removed completely. It's great and actually my favourite of the bunch, but if you're interested in online, you better go with Steam. You have probably heard that Steam has no online multiplayer as well, but that's not correct - that version has it and it still works to this day (not perfect, but you can play at least). The problem is, once again, the online community - which is basically non-existent, so it may be very difficult to play with randoms.

As for others:

**Worms United,** the original and its expansion, is a effective trip down memory lane or a simple way to try out the classic, but the interest in it will probably end there for you.

Avoid **Worms World Party Remastered.** Worms World Party was originally just Armageddon on steroids, but Armageddon's free updates have mostly put it on par with World Party's new features from back then. The Remastered version of World Party has a few oddities that most people didn't like and is unstable performance-wise - the only thing it has over Armageddon in my opininion is native controller support, but otherwise I highly recommend avoiding it.

**Worms Revolution** is a fun diversion from the standard formula thanks to a few new features. However, like Ultimate Mayhem, the online mutliplayer portion has been removed, so keep this in mind. Similar comments for the Steam version as well.

**Worms Forts** has a pretty interesting take on the 3D formula and a robust single player campaign to explore that formula. Consider playing it only if single player (or local multiplayer) interests you, as this one is the original version and therefore the servers for onine have been shut down a long time ago.",2024-05-21 21:24:13,8,

submission,basil_kel,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"I'm new to this franchise and I was just wondering why Ultimate Mayhem was the last (to my knowledge) 3D game and then after that the games became 2D again. I thought it might have just been that people didn't like how the gameplay was translated into 3D but after playing both Armageddon and Ultimate Mayhem the gameplay is basically identical except with quite a few advantages that come with the 3D space in UM

Did the 3D games just perform badly or something? I haven't seen any reason for people to dislike them, I actually find the gameplay a lot more comfortable with a 3D camera since the screen feels less cluttered and zoomed out, and the environments feel a lot more natural. I also just find traversing a 3D space more fun in general.

I'm not actually sure what the current state of this series is, I know there was a game relatively recently (Rumble) but I never see anyone talk about it. Do you think it's likely we'll get anymore full-3D Worms games in the future?",2024-05-18 17:53:08,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/1cv2zkf/why_did_worms_go_back_to_2d/
comment,piat17,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"From what little I know about the development of the series, making the 3D games was actually pretty challenging in terms of development (for one, they all use a custom engine that was specifically designed from the ground-up to support Worms-like terrain destruction in a 3D environment, something that was not obvious or simple to achieve back in the PS2 era). Being challenging means being more expensive, and while the games didn't do badly in terms of sales from what I understand, they also were not exceptionally successful, either.

My theory (so something I'm not saying because I know, just an opinion) is that Team17 found themselves a bit in a difficulty after Worms 4 and decided to go the safe route rather than risking wasting a lot of money on developing a new 3D title (that would probably have required changing the 3D engine substantially, if not making a new one).

That safe route ended up making 2D Worms games designed to be like the originals before Worms 3D - starting with Worms: Open Warfare for the PSP: if you notice, a lot of games up to Reloaded are essentially variations or expansions of Open Warfare.

They saw that got some success that way and decided to continue down that path. And when they felt safe enough to start making some bigger changes in terms of gameplay and visuals, they nevertheless still stuck to the 2D formula for this reason (Revolution+ClanWars first, WMD later),

Unfortunate that the game that tried to get the franchise in a new direction (sans spin-off minigame-like titles) was the one that felt like it made to chase trends - and therefore having the least substance to it (Rumble and Battle Royales). I really hope the franchise isn't dead yet after that one, though at this point I'm left wondering if Team17 has even a dev team left in it and have not basically become publishers-only. The information on that and the IP's future is basically non-existent as of now... we'll just have to wait and see.

To be honest... I would just be happy to see update to the old games at this point. Release Worms 3D and the original Worms 4 on GOG, then update Ultimate Mayhem to include the last few missing bits of content, modern steam input powered controller support and a couple of bugfixes. I would just be happy with this.

\~\~\~

One thing about the gameplay and comparison between 3D and 2D games: it really depends on the user you're asking. If there's something that classic Worms fans (1 to WWP, flagship Armageddon) and modern Worms fans (Open Warfare to WMD, flagship WMD or Clan Wars) can agree on, it's disliking the 3D games. And for some of their reasons to do so, at least as a point of criticism I kinda agree (as someone who generally likes the 3D games more myself).

I think that's the saddest thing about the situation, really. We never got to see what the franchise could do in a 3D environment beyond the original PS2-era games, as WUM is just a remaster, and what gameplay improvements could've been put on the table thanks to new technologies that became available later on.

*NDR sorry about the wall of text, I kinda went on a rant, but you know - this subject is something I've often thought about in the past few years, so I surmised I could try and expand on my thoughts here.*

**TL;DR:** it's unlikely we'll see new 3D games, or even more new Worms games in general, due to T17 appearing to have left the series to rest for a while. The 3D games were hard to make and at some point they decided to stick to what they knew worked and was successful and build on that, eventually becoming a little dependent on it. As far as gameplay goes, it's up to everyone's opinion, but I have to admit that most of the fans of the series tend to like the 2D games more for various reasons.",2024-05-18 18:38:32,11,
comment,oneeyedziggy,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"3d isn't inherently better than 2d, and for worms formula, 2d offers just enough constraints to make the game feel more strategic and less like a (slow motion) action platformer...¬†

also intersting b/c in 2d the weapons effectively take what would be a an infinite-length cylinder out of the terrain if it were 3d instead of just the sphere the 3d games DO take...

the 3d voxel system is just inherently less precise as an engine even if you're taking a slice of it, it's not pixel-precise like 2d is, and most modern gaming computers don't have the power to making the voxels that small and still render enough of them",2024-05-20 21:47:27,5,
comment,sedulouspellucidsoft,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"The x axis. But I‚Äôve always wanted to play a game that mixes both 3D and 2D to get the best of both worlds.

But you‚Äôre right that a problem with 3D is that there are too many places to hide in 3D, which doesn‚Äôt translate to riveting gameplay. There would need to be more weapons to bunker bust or destroy terrain en masse! Or the bazooka could destroy terrain in an infinite length cylinder like it does in actuality in the 2D games, haha. I think it may not look weird with the right animation. üòõ

You‚Äôd definitely have to play in both 3D and 2D, though, because in the 2D view you‚Äôd get worms clipping through terrain, so you‚Äôd need the 3D view for context.

It definitely adds exciting elements, though. For instance, by hitting one island, you could hit a worm on different island üòõ But it‚Äôd be easy to spot that opportunity as all worms you could hit would clip through terrain in the 2D view.

Hopefully I explain it well.

Edit: The 3D voxels can be imprecise whereas the 2D pixels can be precise.",2024-05-20 22:53:41,1,
comment,oneeyedziggy,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"> The x axis.

THE X axis it an arbitrary reference frame decided by the game engine... and there's a really good chance neither you nor your target are on it

Are you saying it should just swap to a 2d slice along the line between you and your target?

seems like asking the dev team to build and debug two separate engines AND a smooth transition between them, which, there's probably a way to make it work, but it feel like a hard sell given the luke warm reception the 3d games got in the first place, which is why i think they went back to just 2d and polished that experience up a bit 

but yea, it seems implausible to be able to view all enemies from a 3d map, in a 2d view as well... and some people would complain about the removal of the skill challenge of skill-shooting missiles in 3 dimensions

> For instance, by hitting one island, you could hit a worm on different island üòõ But it‚Äôd be easy to spot that opportunity as all worms you could hit would clip through terrain in the 2D view.

that sounds like a nightmare for predictability... i suspect a mathematician could prove that any 2 positions in that system could be manipulated such that any third position were on the same 2d x coord as one of the original 2 worms... so it would be functionally the same as 1d worms b/c you could always make any work on the map appear very close in the 2d projection of the 3d world, then just gank them... more of a mobile puzzle game than a worms game",2024-05-21 00:41:18,3,
comment,MoonJellyGames,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"I was so excited for Worms 3D, and while I found a lot to enjoy about it, it was quickly obvious that some things just didn't translate well. Some of it was due to limitations of the tech (and perhaps, experience of the developers). Even for its time, it wasn't very good-looking. The terrain destruction was impressive in its own right, but a clear step back from the pixel-perfect blasts we were used to in 2D.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to play Worms 4 until long after it came out. It was a massive step up, and it introduced things to the series that I hope we always have (turrets we're such a good idea).

But the improvements of 4 just made it more clear how the game can't really translate 1:1 to 3D, just conceptually. A huge element of Worms games is digging tunnels to hide from being knocked into the water, or getting hit with air strikes, or whatever else. In 3D, this doesn't work at all. There's no camera set-up that can clearly show a network of tunnels in 3D in a way that's easily readable. 

The other thing is the artillery gameplay, which is kind of the whole point, right? In 2D, you can zoom out for a good view, aim as needed, try to account for all of the relevant physics factors, and take your shot. In 3D, you have to be looking up at the sky, and rely on the HUD to get a sense of your angle. This could probably be done much better now using a trail-renderer to show the start of the path or something, but I think it still wouldn't work as well. You'd be much more inclined to stick to weapons that you aim more directly at your opponents. 

I could go on, but I'll leave it at that.

I'm a long-time fan of WA and WWP, but I think the series peaked at WMD (in spite of a few missteps). It's such a shame that game didn't kick off a new series of games in that style, and with its best ideas.",2024-05-18 20:44:10,6,
comment,Familiar_Ad_9920,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"Cant you just go to sky view and look at the whole map to see your angle in 3d? Or you mean something else?

comment,MoonJellyGames,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"You can, but it isn't as helpful once you start aiming. In 2D, you can see everything you need in order to adjust your angle and power accurately.

comment,MoonJellyGames,Why did Worms go back to 2D?,"I've played plenty, though it has been years.

Maybe ""guesswork"" isn't the best word for it. It is indeed a skill to examine the target from multiple angles, then adjust your worm's direction and firing angle accordingly. But the fact that (while making steep artillery shots) can't see everything at the same time makes it significantly harder, and not in a way that I personally find to be very interesting. 

With all of that said, I actually do like the 3D Worms games. Unfortunately, I didn't get to play Worms 4 extensively until long after it came out (maybe 2007-ish), but I was super impressed with how much they improved upon what they built with Worms 3D, which was a super ambitious experiment in its own right.",2024-07-17 14:40:18,1,

submission,piat17,Worms W.M.D missing weapon descriptions in Crafting Weapon Inventory,"So, it's possible I'll fire up W.M.D again to play online with a few relatives in the next couple of weeks, so I've reinstalled and did a few local matches to get a hang of the game and, in particular, see what's the technical state of it ever since the devs stopped updating it (which was around the same time I stopped playing it regularly with friends, too).

Now, I've been aware that with the Brimstone update they introduced a few bugs: one non-game-breaking but quite annoying bug involves the descriptions of the weapons, which no longer show up in the inventory. This is valid for the standard weapon (but I don't remember if they were ever there) as well as the crafted ones (which I'm 100% were there in versions before the Brimstone update), with the latter in particular being pretty annoying - especially for a beginner who's learning what each crafted weapon is doing. At the very least, it's weird they removed it since the space for the description is still present in the Crafting Inventory, right below the recipe cost - it's just empty space now, though, so I always found their disappearance as unintended.

I've grouped this one with the series of bugs introduced in the Brimstone update that was unfortunately never fixed by T17 back in 2019, and as I just tested that hasn't changed in 2024. My one question would be, are there any known mods, file modifications in the game's folder, or any more or less complicated solutions to get the weapon description in the inventory back during matches? Or am I to consider that as a permament bug? I would like to fix it since it would help my friends a lot as first time players, but even knowing it's unfixable would suffice at this point (at least I can just accept it for what it is).

Thanks for any help you can provide.",2024-04-14 22:49:49,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/1c46nuy/worms_wmd_missing_weapon_descriptions_in_crafting/

In this puzzle game, players navigate a herd of sheep through various obstacles and challenges. Retaining the distinctive art style and humor of the ""Worms"" franchise, ""Flockers"" delves into a darker narrative. Trapped within a factory by the worms, the sheep are being utilized as weapons, subject to dismemberment and other grim fates. Their plight for liberation adds depth to the established universe of ""Worms."" I discovered this game through the Team17 website. Have you had the opportunity to experience ""Flockers""?

Climbed up, placed another one just high enough that I can jump to it. Then with the orher worm still on the ground, I placed a dynamite under myself and jumped above it just before the explosion, so it would launch me to the 2nd grider. Then with the same technique as on the first one, I moved one of the worms to the very edge of it, climbed on his head with another one and just *barely* managed to jump to the crate and pick it up...

I posted this recently in another thread, some useful stuff here you might like:

The only advantage W.M.D has is that it has an active ranked automated system for playing games. Though it's far outshadowed by it's lack of customizability that Worms Armageddon has. It has some weapons that aren't in other games, but most of them can say the same thing.

Supposedly W.M.D has more active players, but from all the players I know from WA who have played W.M.D say it's of far less quality, buggy, and feels empty compared to WA.

Worms Armageddon has more customizability than every other Worms game combined.

It's still being developed, it has active Leagues(though not official, you have to find them yourself) some with pocket money prizes.

More and more players are streaming competitive matches and casual games than ever before.

Myself and Mablak have started a Podcast series which is full of tutorials, tips, news for leagues etc and interviews with legends of the community, from players, map makers, scheme designers, developers and more!

Worms Armageddon though, could do with a more active community in order to grow again, it's more active than it's been in the past 5-6 years though right now, with more older players coming back, and the community being more helpful and friendly!

comment,RememberThinkDream,Armageddon online still active?,"What's your budget? What country are you buying from?

For Worms Armageddon, you don't need anything spectacular, but if you plan on playing more powerful games with Xbox game pass, you should be ok with a sort of low-mid to mid tier gaming laptop. Or if you have enough money and think you will use it enough, a mid to high tier is more than enough for most!

I would always advise to get a PC though, you will get more bang for your buck, of course if you need to be mobile it isn't as much as option.

Best advice I can give, is decide what your budget is, then do the research yourself, learn what components are most important so you can better understand what is a good deal or not.

If you have a really low budget, a refurbished gaming laptop isn't a bad idea, as long as it comes from a trusted seller/manufacturer! I've purchased a few in the past and never been disappointed, even my latest mobile phone was a refurbished model, one of the latest as well, and it's AWESOME for like 50% of the original price lol.

Do your research, shop around, don't just buy the first thing you see, look at as many different retailers as possible, then you can pick what you like best!",2024-03-17 22:15:10,2,

comment,RememberThinkDream,How can you compare these games?,"Sorry but you are a bit mistaken!

Worms Armageddon has more features than every other game in the franchise combined.

Jonno from Team17 actually came to TUS forums when WMD was being developed to ask for advice, not that they actually followed it much.

The roping in WA/W2/WWP always will be superior to any other in the franchise, the roping in WMD, is the best roping they've made since, but still way worse.

They even used one of my songs(WA remix) on their official stream.

Optimistically, I think we may be due for a new *Worms* soon (or at least in the next 3ish years or so). Even more optimistically, a Team17 dev might lurk in this subreddit, or might come across this thread if they search on Google for ""Worms Game Wishlist Reddit"" or something, you never know. With this in mind, what do you hope to see in the next worms game?

Here's my list personally:

* **Bring back Rope Racing**. One of the most dissapointing things to me about *W.M.D* was is that Rope Racing practically didn't exist besides kinda existing in like 1-2 story missions (at least on Switch and Xbox where I played the most). Let me play Rope Racing locally and online using maybe around 12ish pre-made maps, along with maps from... 

* **In-Game Map Editor, With In-Game Community Hub to Share/Download Maps**. I know the PC version of *W.M.D* had a map editor, and the Steam Workshop is cool, but imagine if there was a in-game community hub akin to *Mario Maker* or *Levelhead* that allowed you upload and download custom maps and gamemodes across the Xbox/PlayStation/Steam/Switch communities. Team17 could even use some of the most popular and highest rated custom maps/gamemodes to feature in online play. Of course, this feature unlocks it's fullest potential with...


* **Cross-Platform Play**. Granted, this one is more or less expected considering *Worms Rumble* had it, but it's still worth mentioning since a mainline *Worms* game hasn't had it yet. 

* **Increased Crate Limit**. I liked *W.M.D* so I don't want to sound like I'm just shitting on it lol, but another disappointing thing about *W.M.D* to me was that it never felt like there was that many crates on screen even if you set everything to max, which kinda nerfed the chaos a little bit. I tried re-creating ""Crazy Crates"" from *Worms Reloaded* in *W.M.D* with terrible results. Let me have my fun.

Keep the interior map regions. This was a super clever idea.

Worms Open Warfare art was like, the peak for the series, they just looked so fun and expressive.

Gameplay-wise, getting the physics as close as possible to Armageddon would really be my main thing. I want worms bouncing, sliding, etc all over the place. I also wouldn't mind crafting making a return, THAT is a feature I didn't think I'd like as much as I did.

Vehicles, ehhh I could go with or without. If they stay, I think they need to be changed severely. The drillboat in particular makes it really easy for people to just chill in the water at the bottom of the map tanking damage (if they're not straight-up hiding underground)",2024-03-14 19:07:05,2,

It should also take inspiration from noita and have physics affected terrain:

dirt: regular worms terrain, rock: more resistant terrain, bedrock: indestructible terrain, sand: gravity affected terrain that can suffocate worms over time, wood and metal structures (decorations) that can be broken loose from terrain and will fall and or break on landing also wood burns a certain amount between turns.

water: like Revolution but less blobby. like noita. can have other liquids too.

terrain themes would use all of these with textures that apply to each type and you would be able to make custom maps paint style with them too.

plus everything you said, remove vehicles and remove crafting, but keep the weapon variants of wmd, make it that you can only get from crates.

keep interior regions from wmd too, but more like caves as well as buildings.",2024-05-09 10:55:04,1,

comment,Unusual_5444,"It's been almost 8 years since the last mainline Worms game, what is in your wishlist for the next entry?","I¬¥m also leaving a few suggestions. First of, I would really appreciate it, if they were to release a new 3D Worms, maybe make the same game in both 2D and 3D style, swiching to whatever you want to play, as mentioned somewhere else here (as far as possible). What bothers me, is that the old worms games had a ton of ""environments"" or themes to choose from, whereas in the new games it¬¥s just like 5. So I would really appreciate more map themes. My ideas would be:

a futuristic like setting; Arab or Egypt Setting or something else dessert like; Wild West; Prehistoric; Middle Age; Antarctic (I can imagine it having a bit of a christmas theme, with a christmas fabric on the map); Horror Theme (with mansion, graveyard); The Moon; Ancient Japan Setting; Heaven; Hell; Carribean/Pirate setting; WW2... most of these already existed in old versions. Some can even have their own features, that distinguishes them from others, like e.g. in the heaven map, you can¬¥t drown but actually just fall to your death and it has small ways and platttforms, the Carribean Setting contains lots of little islands, the moon has many water holes you can fall into, the wild west contains many canyon mountains and therefore has many higher grounds and so on.

That along with a map customizer would be really fun, also downloadable maps. And the option, to make the map bigger, if you play with 6 others.

A Fortress mode or ""not turn based"" mode could be cool, like in rumble, but... well better :D

Also Cross Play, like you mentioned, would be great. If they would make it right, they could make a Worms game that lasts for many years. I wouldn¬¥t mind an ingame shop than.",2024-08-08 07:25:04,1,
comment,DevilBlackDeath,"It's been almost 8 years since the last mainline Worms game, what is in your wishlist for the next entry?","* **Custom terrain :** I've just come back to Armageddon, and the modded custom terrains are amazing. And it's not like the Worms terrain algorithm requires a ton of textures. The terrain, floor, roof, 2 bridge ends, bridge, destroyed terrain, and whatever fluff you want to add to the theme (decorations, particles, background, clouds). Seriously, if you let people import thousands of random PNGs, just let them create custom terrain themes already... I don't mind if each terrain can even have limitations (you don't want to import a bridge texture ? then no bridge, don't want WMD-style interiors, fine as well, especially since this probably requires at least 3 or 4 different textures : outside, inside, swapping zone mask, and inside collision mask). And let users pick whether they want classic style (the one I just described) or WMD-style (pictures overlapped on top of each other in a way that makes sense) terrain generation for their theme.
* **More image-based map customization :** The ability, for imported image maps, to have indestructibility masks, interior mask + interior texture if keeping this WMD mechanic. Also add the ability to have a ""destroyed terrain"" image and custom backgrounds/particles/clouds too (United used that for custom levels it seems).
* **Team customization imports :** Allow us to import custom hats, soundbanks, flags, graves... Nuff said. I think Revolution/Clan Wars and WMD are the only ones to allow this in official capacity :(
* **Scriptable weapons :** The ability to script weapons and have custom graphics for them would be sweet, not a must-have, but it would be really cool.
* **Shareable Schemes :** Shareable schemes would be really cool, some minor scripting to allow for stuff like WMD-style crafting, or a shop system or anything like that would be cool.
* **Skinnable weapons :** The ability to have custom images as replacement for any weapon, and to be able to set that per team (this way you could have your own grenade, bazooka, sheep (or have it be some other animal), your custom fruit-shaped cluster grenade of mass destruction, your custom holy or UNholy grenade.
* **More fine-grained control in schemes :** Hidden by default obviously, but being able to access advanced stuff like per weapon modifiers (velocity, damage, gravity, weight/bounciness, number of rebounds for bazooka-like projectiles),
* **Extra modes and scriptable modes :** With Ultimate Mayhem Renewation and Armageddon mods, the community has proven they can think of innovative and fun new modes, let the community cook !
* **A new 3D Worms :** Seriously we're overdue for a proper sequel to Mayhem/Ultimate Mayhem. Ideally as much of the features above would be a part of it. Given the tools I think the community would be more than willing to create custom terrain, custom maps and team customization items, and skinned weapons, even in 3D.

Basically, I think customization is the bread and butter of Worms. The more it has, the better it is, and the more people it can satisfy, both classic Armageddon fans, retro 1 fans, and modern Reloaded/Revolution or WMD fans.",2024-09-02 13:59:22,1,

WMD only introduced gimmicky gameplay.  Idiotic tacked on ideas (survival games have crafting now, why not worms?, games have battle royale now, why not worms?). 

Deep customization, people want worms games they can make uniquely theirs.  I like your ideas about map creation, allow the weapons to be customized as well.  Inexcusable that as new worms games were released, they had less and less customizability.

Recycle the old physics engine, because somehow they got worse over the years, WMD being one of the very worst.

Buy whichever one you want, and I'll gift you Worms Armageddon on Steam anyway since it's by far the best in the series.

The only advantage W.M.D has is that it has an active ranked automated system for playing games. Though it's far outshadowed by it's lack of customizability that Worms Armageddon has.

Worms Armageddon has more customizability than every other Worms game combined.

It's still being developed, it has active Leagues(though not official, you have to find them yourself) some with pocket money prizes. 

More and more players are streaming competitive matches and casual games than ever before.

Myself and Mablak have started a Podcast series which is full of tutorials, tips, news for leagues etc and interviews with legends of the community, from players, map makers, scheme designers, developers and more!

Worms Armageddon though, could do with a more active community in order to grow again, it's more active than it's been in the past 5-6 years though right now, with more older players coming back, and the community being more helpful and friendly!

If you do the port forwarding method you can use the menus and set up the game how you like, if you use HostingBuddy you still have all the same options (there might be some exceptions I can't recall), except you have to type them in as commands in the lobby. It takes some getting used to.¬†


The basic idea is you enter the lobby, ask hostingbuddy to host your game, enter a password, then share that code with your friends so they can join. Once in the lobby, the player who set rhe password can then type commands to change the settings like weapons, sudden death, worm counts etc. Then as long as everyone has readied up you can tell HostingBuddy to start the match and you're off to the races. There are built in schemes as well for eaay setup, and you can type all your commands in a single line, meaning if you save it to a clipboard you can just paste it and you're all set.

submission,bradyo2,'Worms' Voice Clip - Did I imagine this?,"Hi folks, 

I played Worms + Worms Armageddon a lot as a kid and was looking to add some Worms sound clips into my Twitch Stream. I was surprised to see there was actually quite a lot of resources for documenting and finding everything the Worms say in these first couple of games and I've managed to find a good chunk of the ones I want.

However, there is one specific voice clip which I am almost certain I heard regularly in these games but I cannot find any evidence of it's existence anywhere! I've listened to Youtube videos of all Worms voice FX, read the Worms Wiki and been sent files of all the files ripped from the original Worms game on PS1 and can't find it at all.

The voice clip in question is one of the Worms saying **""Now you've done it!""**, which I assume would be after they've been hit and damaged in some way. Does anyone else even remember them saying this, and if so do you know anywhere I can find the voice clip for it? It's driving me mad as I was so sure it was what I was hearing but now I feel like I've imagined it! As far as I remember, the Worm didn't have any accent or anything, it was just the default standard 'Worms' voice.

The last Worms game I played was Worms 3D and I only played it very briefly so I doubt it's from that game. I'm almost certain it'll be from Worms (PS1) or less likely it'll be on Worms Armageddon (PC), but if not then I'm out of ideas.

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!",2024-03-07 11:54:15,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/1b8stgm/worms_voice_clip_did_i_imagine_this/

A common mistake I make is waiting to see if my shot lands and forgetting to move my worm to safety. Number three is to be aware of any environmental hazards near you and your enemies. Think of whether you can hit your enemies onto them and how to keep your worms safe from them. Number four sort of builds off this, it is ‚Äúcareful of the water.‚Äù Be very careful not to leave your worms in spots where they can easily be knocked in and prioritize knocking enemy worms in water if possible rather than dealing damage. Number five is don‚Äôt group your worms. Leaving your worms too close to one another allows your opponent to damage them all at once, and in sudden death, when a death explosion kills, it can be the difference between winning and losing. My final tip is to only take long shots if you have to or think it‚Äôs worth it. Lobbing a grenade across the entire map can make for a stylish kill but will usually miss its target.

I hope this helps!",2024-01-05 02:49:04,3,

submission,Oneota,W:A in Qemu (UTM) on M3 MacBook Pro running on Win XP VM - Mouse will not track properly in-game,"I've had a copy of Worms:Armageddon since my college days in 1999.  Recently wanted to play a game, so I whipped up a Windows XP VM in UTM (a nice front-end to QEMU), installed from the ISO I made of the CD, got all the updates I could find online, and launched it.

Seems to work, except if I even touch the mouse in-game, it jumps all over the place and simply will not track right.  I can't select weapons, I can't even use the Quit game dialog box, because it can't seem to figure out where the mouse is.  I've tried disabling the hardware cursors, tried Windowed mode vs. full-screen...I don't know what else to try to get it to cooperate.  I should note that I'm using the trackpad, not an actual mouse, but I don't think that's the problem.  I suspect I'd have the exact same issue with an actual mouse.

I made all my external and internal ports 17011 as stated by the guide and all, and have put the correct details in through Netcomm (Aussie Broadband), but that didn't do anything to help seemingly.

Does anyone know what could be causing this? My friend did mention something called ""CGNAT"" that may be an issue, but I am currently unsure as to what that is and must do more research.

I'm extremely hesitant to use any third party programs due to them using, from what I gather, fairly invasive tech that is technically against Steam's ToS or whatever.

comment,piat17,What worms 3d have and is not found on the other worms games including wirms 4 mayhem?,"Mainly two things:

- Weapons and balance. Worms 3D has a different weapon set compared to other 3D games, with some weapons being specific to this game among the 3D family (like the Red Bull, Sticky Bomb, Petrol Bomb, Nuclear Test). Additionally there are other gameplay differences. Just to list a few: destruction works a bit differently, maps tend to have less land and drowning is more common, explosions and how worms are thrown away by them also work differently in my opinion, oil barrels generate flames like most 2D games instead of poison clouds. This is the main reason why the campaign present in Worms Ultimate Mayhem is very different than the original in Worms 3D, despite featuring the same maps and mission objectives.

- Maps and customisation. The PC version of Worms Ultimate Mayhem has most of the Worms 3D maps available as multiplayer ones, but not all of them. Some of the secret and less standard Worms 3D maps are still missing and thus remain exclusive to the original game. Additionally there are some differences in customisation, with speech banks present only in this game and certain scheme options not being retained in the sequels.",2023-12-07 10:54:19,3,

As far as suggestions, this isn't really something that applies to this map specifically, but generally I think it really helps maps to have been made with a specific scheme in mind. A Battle Race or Boom Race or Shopper or Fort or Capture The Flag or even Warmer map made in this style, while likely requiring a lot more work, would stand a real good chance of becoming a classic, played on for years and maybe decades to come. It's cool to just draw maps to play some Intermediates or whatever on, but for those sorts of schemes, the more competitively minded part of the community insists on using random .LEV maps, so naturally this limits the reach of maps created with no particular scheme in mind. But yeah whatever, it's still a sweet one! Just something to consider in the future, if you end up making more.",2023-12-02 20:03:11,4,

The way I see it, Armageddon menus are a little bit janky, but the wmdb integration and schemes customization via hostingbuddy is legit easier than what WMD provided. Not to mention the broken lobby system in WMD. I'm fine with crafting and vehicles but some basic functionalities of the game are either broken or nonexistent.

comment,piat17,Worms World Party Emulator on PS4/PS5,"If I remember correctly from playing the original PS1 game on a PS1 back then, you need to manually save to the memory card each time you make any customisation change (while making and editing teams). In your case the memory card is 'virtual' of course since you're playing on PS4 via its emulated version, but you still need to do that.

My memory is fuzzy but IIRC in WWP you have to go to the main menu, then select the options submenu. There should be a save button somewhere around there.

EDIT: the other, somewhat annoying point of this is that to recover your customisation settings, you also need to load that save file. I don't remember whether this must be done manually too, or if these is an automatic prompt on game startup.

On PS4/PS5 there's also another option, using save states, though I personally would rather not depend on those.",2023-11-07 13:00:49,1,

submission,Tronche2Cake,Worms Armageddon not launching properly on PC,"I downloaded Worms Armageddon on Steam today, but whenever I try to play, it has an issue: the window will zoom in on the bottom right corner of my home screen, minimize itself and reduce all other windows to a small space in the top left corners. The program doesn't close itself and I can click on it, but the result remains the same.

At no point does the game actually show up on screen, which is what I would expect it to do since it puts all other processes in the background.

I'm on Windows 10 and it used to work well on my desktop PC which was also on Windows 10, but the one I'm currently using is a laptop. Could my screen's resolution be causing this?

I already tried repairing the files on Steam, which didn't work. It did say that one file was broken, and said it was going to re-download it. But when I came back to this menu and pressed the file check button again, it still had 1 broken file.

When I went into the files for myself, I noticed there was an empty file called steam.dat  
Since .dat files hold data, I think it might be the cause of the issue. Is it meant to be empty at the start or is there something missing?",2023-11-02 18:49:13,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/17man7b/worms_armageddon_not_launching_properly_on_pc/

Later on, if the menus still bother you, you can look into the SuperFrontendHD WormKit module (it's all explained on the worms2d.info wiki), that one gives you even more control over resolutions and scaling and such. But have fun for now!",2023-11-09 00:37:35,1,

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

I see on Steam some Worms games on linux platform and decided, before buying them, make some questions about them in this subreddit.

I wanna buy or Worms Clans War, or Worms W.M.D.

Questions are:

1) Are they for low spec computer?

2) Can i play with friends (like with steam remote play together)? Or in multiplayer? Does multiplayer in these games is dead?

3) Does multiplayer in Worms Clan War works? because I see in Steam discussion, tons of people saying ""fix the multiplayer"" and i dont know if I can buy it or not with this problem.

There is a bot who will host games for you if your network setup doesn't allow it or you don't know how to port forward. There is a Discord bot who forwards messages between WA Discord server and WormNET. The game is Win11 compatible with no problems. The community is open and welcoming, but also has trolls and quitters, like every community does. There are cups, league games and tournaments.

IMO the single player campaign is quintessential Worms gameplay and I loved all of the cute CGI cutscenes when I was 6 years old. I know it's ugly nowadays compared to Armageddon/WWP & WMD but it does singleplayer right. WWP is atrocious when it comes to the singleplayer campaign.

I recently launched Worms Armageddon on the PC and there are LOADS of people playing!

I can't blame them. Worms Armageddon is the epitome of Worms games. When someone says ""you play that worms game?"" first at mind is Armageddon.

Me and three friends have recently returned to Worms Armageddon. I wanted to ask if there are any mods that you consider ""must-have"". Mods that either offer more content to the game, like maps or weapons, or that offer quality of life improvements. 

Or any other mods you recommend, too! Any recommendations are appreciated :)

Also please mention the website where I can download the mod, because I noticed that there is no Steam workshop for Armageddon.",2023-06-24 21:54:15,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/14i4r1u/what_are_your_musthave_mods_for_worms_armageddon/
comment,x0rang3x,"What are your ""must-have"" mods for Worms Armageddon?","Depends on how much effort you want to put in it. 
If not much effort - there are a few cool mods suggested already using wormkit, those are mostly qol improvements, like being able to get maps easy or customize water color.
On other hand there's Project X, which makes worms Armageddon completely new game, adding tons of new custom weapons, game mods and graphical improvements. But its only available for version 3.6.1 and very finicky to install and get it to work. I am hardcore WA fan, but since installing Project X I only play with other people who has it and I also made a couple custom weapons for the mod.",2023-06-25 09:33:23,3,

Now, I must say.. the game has very awkward controls in my opinion, but it is to be expected when it's older than I am xD

But that's not a problem, here's a module to have the ability to remap them, if you'd like!

comment,Ed-Board,In circa 2019 I independently came up with a simple innovation prototype for the classic Forts gameplay mode. (Explanation in comments.),"#Explanation:
First off I think it's important for me to say that somebody else might have already done this, and if that's true, I don't claim credit for being the first person. I did this on my own while thinking about forts maps and building some of my own, and if this isn't a new idea then I am sorry. There also might be some serious problems with the balancing or even just the map shape that I'm not aware of because I am not a Worms Armageddon expert like so many others are. For all I know this will break quickly in testing.

Now, moving on, I'll explain how this concept works and what's different.

You still spawn on one fort in your map, and you still can't go into the enemy fort. You start in your own fort no matter what.

The difference is that terrain in the middle. You *can't* spawn there, but you can go there. It is surprisingly viable to paracute in from the top of your own fort when the wind is right, and that is what you are encouraged to do. I don't know if ninja rope experts can also do it with ninja ropes or not.

This allows you to advance a bit further, and collect crates. Note that dead tree in the middle. It's meant to be another obstacle in the worm's way toward getting to the other side of the crate drops, that the other team will want to pick up before you do. You would probably have to ban shotguns to make this gamemode work. Or even add several more obstacle dead trees. Or upheave the map design a bit.

Maybe this isn't in the spirit of forts, but that wasn't exactly my objective. I wanted to create a new twist on something familiar in Worms gameplay.

That's it, that's the concept.",2023-06-03 02:07:41,1,

You can even make it funnier by pressing backspace once and activating the drill at the top of your jump. You can jump off a cliff and activate the drill, and keep on drilling when you hit the ground, sliding horizontally even and pushing whoever's in your path. And sometimes it can do incredible suicidal or non-suicidal damage if your target is a worm in a very narrow pit. I swear this is true, it's actually practical in some situations and it's one of my favourite things to do.

It would be much appreciated if someone could recommend one of the worms games for me to buy for me and my friends to play on the PS3.

I was just about to buy the worms collection as a physical, but upon some research, it turned out that it includes titles which might not interest me that much (mainly the iOS/android worms2: armageddon).

submission,syrmoe,Dodging and Projectile Interactions (IDEA),"I've been pondering about how introducing a mechanic like dodging or interacting with projectiles could potentially impact the game. We've seen games like Fortnite successfully change the meta by incorporating building mechanics into the FPS genre, which added a new layer of depth and skill to the gameplay.

So, my question is: Why hasn't Worms explored the possibility of making the game more time-intensive and reflex-based? Imagine if we could implement dodging mechanics or ways to interact with projectiles / build terrain etc. ‚Äî do you think it would enhance the overall experience?",2023-05-22 09:24:03,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/13oltia/dodging_and_projectile_interactions_idea/

Generally you are unable to save during a match, you must finish it before you are able to save your progress based on the outcome of said match.

I never use it, although a mole squadron is great at digging through thick defenses without exposing your worm with a drill/blowtorch.

I think even Prod has its uses because of the predictable angle a prodded worm falls, even though a shotgun/longbow is a superior alternative.

The mortar however is pure trash. It's very hard to aim the clusters right, and even when they hit they don't do much damage. The cluster grenade is easier to use and does a whopping 100 damage or so if placed directly under a worm.

Yes sometimes a darksider will have no access to crates, and this allows the one on top to grow healthier and stronger. But it's all about strategy and out thinking your opponent (and not giving up).

If I recall, hovering over it just said ""Use the Darkside"", and it wasn't actually an in-game weapon. What is it? What does it do? Why can't I find anything written about it?  
  
(I know that in the worms multiplayer scene, 'Lightside' is a term for players who stay up top and fight to the death with honour, etc, and 'Darkside' is a term for players who like to hide instead of dying, which is considered a little untoward. It would make sense if it were some kind of invisibility ability (based on 'Darkside', and that the image looks like a transparent worm), but I don't think it was)",2023-03-26 00:52:23,3,

submission,None,Worms Grand Strategy Game | Tactics Game,"I'm curious - what does this community think about a real time (or turn-based) grand strategy in Worms setting? Or something along the lines of Company Of Heroes, but with Worms?   
First idea would have to incorporate much more world-building ideas to the Worms franchise - you would manage either a state, piece of land or a whole new country and manage its resources, create and command troops etc. CoH type game would be much more streamlined, but wouldn't necessarily exclude deeper mechanics, tactical use of cult-classic weapons such as Holy Grenade or Banana Bomb.  
I wonder because I find expanding Worms into other genres very very doable - the only obstacle I imagine, would be money because of developing a new genre to T17 and uncertainty about how much people would actually buy such a game. Would you? Because I would certainly do...",2023-03-13 19:56:58,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/11qjsq3/worms_grand_strategy_game_tactics_game/
comment,Fungruel,Worms Grand Strategy Game | Tactics Game,"Sounds amazing. I always found the aiming really difficult on the 3D games and having them so it themselves would be great. The only one I liked was Forts: Under Siege that actually had a bit of base building and it was a lot easier to hit an enemy's big building than just a tiny little worm

Company of Heroes style would be great. Maybe have different squad types. I think it would be better for a Worms game though if you built individual worms and equipped them with the weapon you want and assign them to squads yourself. The weapons are one of the best parts of the game and having the majority of the worms use the same few weapons all the time would be a waste imo. Plus it would open up for so many combinations

I'd never thought about this before but now it seems like such a good idea.

Oh yeah, it'd be cool too if you could take control of a single worm in the heat of the action and wreck it up on the battlefield",2023-03-13 21:43:26,2,

comment,NogardDerNaerok,What are the best competetive settings for Worms Armagedon?,"Hm well actually, there's very few regular ground schemes that work as well in a free-for-all setting as they do when played 1v1 or 2v2, when competitive fairness (the best player winning a high % of the time) is the primary goal.

This certainly applies to BnG, Elite, Intermediate, Team17, Kaos, even things like Roper, and the various Shopper variants, which have all historically been among the top competitive schemes, but only when done 1v1 or 2v2. The three-way nature of endgames where players are at some point given a clear choice between eliminating the strongest of their opponents or not... it just works out to be the opposite of fair, almost by definition. So I would only really recommend 1v1v1 and above if you're going for a more relaxed, fun oriented experience, the format is great for that. But when you want to compete at these schemes, instead play them using some sort of tournament format, or have the winner of each 1v1 round stay on and rotate their opponents, or find a fourth player for 2v2, would be my recommendation. There just isn't a scheme setting like turn time or the availability of movement utilities (rope and jetpack), or even very limited weapon pools, or playing on particular maps that can solve this fundamental issue.

With that said, there is a type of Worms scheme in existence that works totally fine with whatever number of players you happen to have, namely the large variety of racing schemes that have been fleshed out. Battle Race, Boom Race, Bungee Race, Chute Race, (Time Trial) Rope Race, Big RR and numerous others can all get very competitive, but they just aren't made to cover as wide a variety of skill sets each, compared to more traditional ground schemes. Still, they're worth checking out for sure, and even more so when you have an odd number of players in your lobby.

Anyway, hope this is at least somewhat helpful. For further research, I'll just leave you with the wiki page listing most of the popular schemes:

https://worms2d.info/Schemes

It can't hurt to have a search through that, maybe you stumble upon something your group will love to play 1v1v1 even though it technically isn't as competitively fair as 1v1 Elite or whatever.",2023-01-29 13:14:10,3,
comment,NogardDerNaerok,What are the best competetive settings for Worms Armagedon?,"Thinking about this some more, I guess my personal list of 1v1v1 schemes I've had the most fun with in recent years would be something like...

* Alt-F4 (with five worms per player for 1v1v1 instead of the usual six)
* Hysteria (no rules necessary)
* Battle Race (either with or without phased worms, but with is safer)
* Team17 (on complex island maps, with 15 minute round time instead of the 12 we've been using otherwise)
* BnG (kill the leader rule, I guess)
* Boom Race (the more modern variant, with the weapon-doesn't-end-turn option enabled)
* Kaos (but there's a lot of different variants in existence, no idea which would be most suitable)

In roughly that order.

Most of these do require some unwritten agreement not to team up on the strongest player (but instead always attack whoever currently has the highest total HP), or for nobody to try and just hide far away from the action until the endgame, or not to go too hard on the mindgames of pretending to be a weaker player than you really are, etc. But that's just something each group has to agree on amongst themselves, knowing that no set of solutions will bring them all the way to 100% fairness regardless.",2023-01-29 13:42:34,1,

Yes, they did put a lot of stuff from the early 3d versions in there. Basically I believe that they struggled a lot with the first 3d ones and just refined it. The camera was awful in the first worms 3d and in worms Forts. That might be the reason, you don¬¥t ever see both for sale anymore.  The names are just a little confusing.

But even woms Forts was fun. kinda broken but fun nonetheless. 

That said, I skipped so many lectures at uni for some multiday worms 3d/mayhem sessions with my friends. We played that all the time and had such a blast. But they have a longer learning curve than the 2D ones. You had to play those for hours till you had the 3D under control.

submission,Kapiork,Worms Armageddon - first impressions (WARNING: L O N G),"Hello! I'm the guy who [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/zfa7o8/worms_armageddon_is_on_85_sale_on_steam_worth_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) if W:A was worth buying it when it was on a big sale. I finally ended up buying it today. So, how did it go?

**Badly. :/**

(EDIT: I don't think I made myself clear here. I don't mean I hate the game. I had plenty of fun. I just mean that I failed many times. Failure can be fun too. I even added some stuff to make this clear.)

I went into the so called ***""Basic Training""***, expecting the usual ""you move with arrow keys and jump with Spacebar (like in 3D games which I'm used to)"", but no - they just threw me right into a shooting range with ***limited time*** to land Grenades properly ^((which I despise - I prefer using them like a weaker Dynamite)). I ended up barely killing myself in the Bazooka training. :/ To my horror, I couldn't just restart from the Bazooka round - I had to redo it all over again. The same was true for the Rope training that I failed solely because I expected to have unlimited number of Ropes.

Somewhere between Basic Training attempts I decided I didn't need it, so I tried to play the campaign mission, but - again, to my surprise - they *require* you to finish at least Basic Training before you can try your skill at missions.

I also tried **Quick Match** at some point. I ran out of time because Ninja Rope turned out to be trickier to use than I expected. I lost a worm because my Homing Missile hit a small bit of terrain I was hoping wasn't there (I didn't have much hope in the Missile anyway). Thanfully the AI wasn't the best, though it *did* land a few really good Bazooka shots. The match was very close. We were both on our last Worms. I Teleported near the enemy, not expecting to die since I had over 50 HP (60-something, I think). Unfortunately, I was thrown into a nearby Mine that *for some reason* exploded immediately on contact. Is that a thing in Armageddon?

Finally, after finishing Basic Training on Bronze, I went into **Missions**, expecting a simple Deathmatch with odds stacked in my favor. Instead, I got something more akin to Crate Brittan from Worms 3D. I ended up clearing it on my first try, though not without some... strong emotions.

Then came along **Mission 2: Operation Market Garden**. To my horror, the only weapons I've been given were Grenades ^((which I hate)), Fire Punch ^((which is close range, while there's quite a big height difference between me and the enemy)) and Shotgun ^((which requires very precise aiming, as I learnt in the Shotgun Basic Training)). Surprisingly though, the height difference between the flowers and the watering can isn't big enough to cause fall damage, which is good, because otherwise I would've probably raged over the fact that I wasn't given a Parachute. :v It went pretty smoothly until the last enemy worm, which ended up in the hole between the watering can and the right flower. Since I blew up a decent hole in there earlier, I thought I could just fall in and Fire Punch the guy into water. Instead, I got **NO U**'d and both of my Worms got punched into their watery graves. Why did I fail? Because the first time the enemy worms bounced off the remaining terrain, while the second worm took fall damage and was left at the (lack of) mercy of the enemy. **Mission failed.** This is where I decided to stop for now. Too many fails for one day. :D

Lastly, some **general thoughts**:

* It's really annoying how double-pressing Enter doesn't cause you to backflip - instead, you have to press Backspace. Thank goodness they steamlined it in later games. Nothing that I can't get used to though.
* The terrain feels really slippery, maybe even more than in Revolution. I can bet that if Revolution had Armageddon's physics, half of the worms that barely didn't slip down in the dynamic water would've plunged into their inevitable death. Again, it's a matter of getting used to it.
* There's no cutscenes - the only tips you get are in the briefing before the missions. It feels a bit jarring to get thrown right into action in the campaign. It doesn't make it worse, just different.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr** this game is much more brutal than I expected, and not in a graphical sense. Still plenty of fun though. :)",2022-12-18 13:48:19,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/zoz0xy/worms_armageddon_first_impressions_warning_l_o_n_g/

comment,Nnine5ix,How to setup a Shopper game in Worms Armageddon?,"you can do in it two ways: offline and online. 

to play offline, You can type ""boggysentme"" in the main menu to unlock extended scheme options, if done correctly a door unlocking sound effect plays, and then you can setup the terrain to indestructible by clicking on the ""create a single or multi-player game"" -> ""set or view the game options"" -> cheats (star on the bottom) -> ""enable indestructible land."" 
	after that, go on ""set or view the weapon options"" and make it so that the bazooka, parachute and ninja rope are set to infinite. 
	On the ""delay"" tab, Give all the weapons no delay (not available at any round)
	on ""crates"",  set: zooka, skunk, banana, air strike, napalm, blow torch, girder, ninja rope, parachute, bungee, teleport, and mole to 0;  the others you can set the likeliness of getting those weapons in crates by how strong they are. (Example: holy hand grenade - 1; dynamite - 4, and all the others)
	on ""power"", you can let all weapons how they are (considering you're editing the intermediate scheme to fit into the shopper scheme); Just change the rope power to max, so that you get infinite rope shots while in the air.
	After that, go back to the ""create a single or multi-player game"" menu and set the time players have to 30 secs, sudden death time to 120 mins, 1 victory to win the match, set the 4th button so that it shows an arrow (make it so that players can't choose what worms they'll be controlling for the round), 200 worm health, and no chance to set where the worms will be placed.
	After all that shit, rename the dropdown text thingy from ""[ User defined]"" to ""shopper"" and save it, so that you dont have to do all that again everytime you want to practice. Now you just put your teams in the ""teams"" box by clicking on them, and enjoy you practice. I dont know if you know hot to set up custom maps on offline mode, so tell me if you dont.

   To practice online, go to ""play over a local area network or the internet"" -> WORMNET -> #AnythingGoes, and type !host shopper, then refresh and enter the game you just opened (if someone else entered, type !kick [nickname] to kick that person). There, type !close so that its just you, and put whatever map you want with !wmdb [number], which you can browse on http://wmdb.org -> maps -> all map types -> shopper, clicking on the (title of the) map you want, and getting the last digits after wmdb.org/
	with that, everything is set and you can put your team to play, click on the lightbulb, and type !start on the chat.

You may need to lower the resolution in the options to something (at least a little) lower than your main screen's resolution to try this.

But either way, this really seems like something that should be possible to fix, perhaps via your graphics driver utility or Windows itself. It just depends on where the misconfiguration is, and it's difficult to guess. Another alternative worth looking into would be the SuperFrontendHD WormKit module, specifically the resolution options available through the .ini file that comes with it.

comment,laitizin_old,Worms 3D no FMV only audio?,"UPDATE: This also works with Worms 4: Mayhem.

After a lot of trial and error, I've finally figured out a way to make the FMVs work on current versions of Windows, and without having to press Alt+Tab every time one starts playing. It's a bit of a hassle, so here's a little tutorial.

\_

First, you'll need to download ""Windowed Borderless Gaming"". I'll be referring to it as ""WBG"" for short.

Extract the downloaded "".zip"" file and then start both WBG and Worms 3D, respectively.

When you get to the game's main menu, press Alt+Tab on your keyboard. If Windows' taskbar doesn't show up, try pressing Win+Tab as well.

After doing that, click on WBG's icon located in the system tray and select ""Add window ( F3 )"", then go back into the game and press ""F3"" on your keyboard. (You can press it more than once, if you're unsure it worked.)

Exit the game, click on WBG's icon once again, and go into ""Settings"" -> ""Game settings"" to check if Worms 3D's executable was detected. If it wasn't, please repeat the previous steps.

While still on the ""Game settings"" tab, type in the same resolution being used to run Worms 3D and then increase it's width value by one (1).

Example:  Worms 3D - 1280x960 / WBG - 1281x960

(You can try increasing the height value instead, but I feel that it doesn't work quite as well.)

Click on ""Apply"", then click on ""Ok"" to close the tab.

\_

Now, at long last, start the game once again and all of the FMVs should be displaying correctly. If it still doesn't work for some reason, try pressing ""F4"" to re-apply your WBG settings while in game.

Hope this helps!",2023-11-19 18:31:37,1,

comment,piat17,Team17 should've kept supporting WMD,"I still dislike that they didn't test their patches that well. The last one had a few very needed features but it also bugged the inventory, which no longer shows weapon descriptions and just has an empty UI box occupying space on the screen with no text that is not necessary or game breaking but is still incredibly annoying.

WMD is one of my favourite games of the franchise and it really didn't that much to reach a great state in terms of its features. It didn't need to get supported for a decade like Armageddon does, just parity with previous games in terms of basic features and squishing all remaining bugs. It does really feel like a missed opportunity.

I don't mind Rumble, I just hoped it featured an arena mode comparable to Duck Game in order to be viable as a party game long term, too. When I understood that wasn't the case, the game ceased to be interesting beyond some matches with the beta back then just to see what the gameplay was like.

comment,None,Worms At The Highest Level,"Hi, thanks for your response!  
Sadly, I don't think I could find any link for a higher level of gameplay... :/

  
Though I have to admit that I definitely did not confuse mode and skill. These two are highly connected in worms series, because the mode sets your possibilities, suhc as ammo, health and the amount of crates that could be used both as a weapons resource and also be used as fuel tanks.  
More powerful weapons mixed with big amounts of time may require much less skill to be required.  
I also don't agree that other modes give less room for tactics and creativity. In fact, jetpacks, dynamites and other powerful tools are the exact thing that deprive the meta off any deeper strategical and tactical thought.

do not stop moving, a nicely timed shotgun + baseball bat combo will instantly frag a worm with no shield (100 dmg), baseball bat can reflect grenades bullets and rockets, rocket shield protects you from ANY damage (until it breaks), if a holy hand grenades hit a worm closely it will instantly deal 100 dmg, the Hammerhead rocket launcher will most likely frag any worm if all rockets hit, the sheep launcher is ridiculously overpowered, for running away or general movement dont forget to use your rope or jet pack, and dont forget to use the little medkit or shield drink that is stored near your health bar

comment,GWJ89,Help needed,"I'd say Worms WMD ex aequo with Armageddon/Worms World Party.

W:A is the classical one in opinion of the majority of the series' players. WWP was just plain better as it was the same game with a few features added and different missions. But it was T17 cheap move and players didn't like it, so they stayed with W:A and they (players, not those hyenas T17) are supporting it to this days. Personally I prefer Worms World Party because I love the ""wormpot"" and it's the only 2D with the wormpot - but W:A has better multiplayer performance etc., and you will find more help and support from the community and more tools for it, and that's what you're looking for I think.

WMD is the newest one from the ""true 2D"" and it's called a spiritual successor of the W:A/WWP. It's main advantages are 
* the crafting system (and thus the widest array of the weapons among the whole worms series - though a significant part of them are just a changed versions of the basic weapons, like grenade -> gas grenade -> sticky grenade, or a bazooka upgrade which just have an additional fire effect etc.)
* Buildings - now you can walk in to various buildings to hide from your enemies
* Vehicles
* Stationary guns (like flamethrower station or sniper station - can't carry this, just use from this place).

It's worth to mention about AI who behaves more like a human. And it won't shoot you (most of the time at least) through the keyhole from the other end of the map, with 100% accuracy.

Main disadvantages of WMD:
* Still considerably smaller playerbase (but Steam version had the Remote Play Together feature, so you can play with you friends and they don't have to buy or even install the game to play with you)
* Very small amount of info - for W:A/WWP you can easily find an exact info about each weapon stats etc. With WMD you have to guess or search in Google for other people guessing. There are a few weapons people don't really know how they work exactly.
* The rope. W:A/WWP have the best ""ninja rope"" weapon in the series - the other ropes are inferior and I'd say less fun (even if easier in some cases, like Worms Reloaded).
* No map editor. This should be the first point actually. Probably in T17 HQ someone said ""no, the game is too good, players won't buy our next titles if this one will bee so good - let's remove the map editor to make sure cash will flow""",2022-08-10 13:07:39,3,

This is a brainstorming project for a Worms game. Have you heard of it?

comment,NogardDerNaerok,Do you think that all the schemes that will ever be super popular have been made already in Worms Armageddon?,"Oh, this is a very interesting question, and quite unique for a game's community to be asking itself.

The diversity that Worms offers to a player, even in a competitive setting, is just about unmatched. What other game or sport even allows you to play it in so many so drastically different ways? Maybe chess in the age of the internet comes kinda close, with all its different time controls and [alternative variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_variants)... but even there, the experience probably isn't as strikingly different as between playing BnG and TTRR or Warmer on WA. Or even between somewhat similar concepts like Battle Race, Boom Race, Bungee Race, Jetpack Race and so on, which each take totally different skills and mindsets to play well. And that's without even delving into the truly weird shit like, I don't know, the Goku Battle Arena scheme. :D

I think between the above and the fact that the game continues to receive updates, the latest couple of which weren't that long ago and added a huge number of extended scheme options that definitely haven't yet been fully explored by the community... I'd put myself pretty firmly in the camp of those who believe we haven't seen the emergence of the last hugely popular WormNet scheme yet. It's true though that it's very difficult to come up with a totally fresh concept, have others to test it out with properly, have it turn out to have lasting appeal, then also get a little lucky with the wider community actually embracing it and the snowball getting rolling.

From a scheme creator's perspective, the task is daunting and certainly the [vast majority](https://worms2d.info/Scheme_ideas) of attempts don't make it all the way to universal stardom. But historically, it has happened a bunch, going back to the very beginnings of WormNet when roping schemes came close to overshadowing default ground schemes during the Warmer era. Then to a slightly lesser degree with Battle Race and Fort around the time WWP was released, when map making was becoming almost a legitimate profession within the community. And then came that whole long period of Elite being seen as the ultimate competitive scheme, with leagues and events like WEL, GigaLiga, ESL and later EAC even offering decent cash rewards for the top players. And roughly concurrently, with the slide towards Shopper and its variants as the quintessential starter schemes for newly online players. Then again with the unlikely explosion of Hysteria in the late 2000s, a scheme not even its creator could have imagined becoming as huge as it did. Then, maybe in response, with the reemergence of standard Intermediate as simultaneously the most popular and most seriously competitive way of playing the game. Finally, with Mole Shopper and Kaos as the big dogs today, plus perhaps the side strain of (another blast from the past) island map Team17 that we've been obsessed with in competition for the past couple of years.

What it ultimately comes down to, even more so than the game's ongoing official support, is the attitude towards experimentation and towards giving new scheme ideas an honest chance, on the scale of the whole community. This waxes and wanes over time, the peaks usually coinciding with new leagues and websites being launched, or events like the Worm Olympics, Worms Scheme Contest and Worst Shot Ever taking place, directing the spotlight to all of the diversity that's out there. Whether or not these events actually happen always seems to come down to one or two people from the community having the time and energy and motivation to organise them, though, and that's the part of it all where we're a little fragile as a community, in a sense. But on the other hand, when the motivation is there and when Things Are Happening, we can be pretty sure that they're in good hands and not being run just because they've always been run, or for the sake of profit like you sometimes see on the larger competitive games out there.",2022-07-21 15:38:31,2,

comment,NogardDerNaerok,Do you think that all the schemes that will ever be super popular have been made already in Worms Armageddon?,">It‚Äôs interesting how long existing schemes gain and lose in popularity. I wonder if competition events come up because of the popularity of a scheme or do they actually make the scheme popular. Because how schemes become popular appears rather arbitrary to me.

Yep, that's the next step along to think about here. My gut feeling is that it's both, or either.

With schemes that are suitable for, and as a result pick up steam in, actual top level competition, starting a league or CWT/EAC-style event focused on them is probably the more important aspect, and the thing that keeps interest in them going long term. But in order to know which scheme to pick for that purpose in the first place, someone somewhere will have needed to notice its potential for it, and that would have come from seeing it played at a high level. So in this case, probably both.

For schemes that seemingly have little interest in positioning themselves as seriously competitive, it's a little more vague and random, down to sheer luck in some part, with no real need for support in any organised competition save for perhaps the Worm Olympics or a TUS cup to get the word out initially. Examples of this I'd mention would be things like BnA (Bow & Arrows) and later Mine Madness, which are just this crazy, fun concept that arrived at the right time (more than 8 randomly spawned mines and huge maps becoming possible in an update) and took WormNet by storm for a few years, but then fell out of fashion somewhat, replaced by the next fun fad. Like the Supersheeper that someone mentioned in a reply here, which became absolutely huge especially among Russian-speaking players and Twitch streamers. But then also turned out not to have as much staying power as something like Intermediate or Kaos, each supported by their respective competitive frameworks in ONL/CWT and Dream's Kaos League.

But then you have an in-between case like Hysteria as well, whose initial fans not only didn't see it as anything other than a fun free-for-all passtime for larger groups of friends, we actively campaigned against seeing it turned into a tryhard competitive 1v1 affair. But precisely that ended up happening anyway, because enough league players wanted to see it happen and so the scheme became one of the most played TUS staples of all time. And so these days, if I were launching an all-around league of my own, I'd be including Hyst for sure!

I suppose the point I'm making is, it's complicated because it's more a sociology problem than one of objectively measurable, raw scheme settings. And while our community isn't huge, it is large enough for it to exhibit the characteristics of a complex system, in the sense that for example world weather does; meaning that making sense of it is unintuitive and very difficult to predict in the medium and long term.",2022-07-22 18:04:23,1,

Personally I haven't played in months and only really play shopper, wxw, supersheeper and occasionally surf+fly+w4w shopper. It's hard to imagine new popular schemes, but if Team17 added some new concept then definitely, but that's unlikely so I'd guess any new schemes will be more niche.

comment,NogardDerNaerok,Was the camera the main thing that ruined Worms 3D?,"The main reasons are gonna depend on who you ask, but from following the series through the initial transition from 2D to 3D, the sentiment at the time from veteran players was more just that W3D didn't ""feel like a Worms game."" To me, more than camera wonkiness, that always felt like it had to do with the level of precision that the engine allowed for; how accurately you could aim from a distance, how possible it was to account for the wind, how predictable the outcomes of explosions were, how precise the jumping and landing from jumps, how relevant it was whether you hid your worm 5 pixels more or less deep into a corner, how satisfying mastering the rope felt, that sort of thing.

Then the next layer of the same argument came down to how the 3D titles never really developed that iconic variety of different ways in which you could enjoy them, again likely as a result of said lack of precision. While in the second generation games, you could practice bouncing low gravity grenades across the map for 5 years straight and still keep improving, and had dozens of others doing the same and competing for the title of best tricky BnG player... the 3D games never saw that sort of specialisation, because no single weapon's mechanics really had the depth to support it, keeping it interesting long term.

submission,Tag365,Inspecting on using Share Play to play Worms World Party/Worms Armageddon two player online on PS4/PS5,"Unfortunately Share Play doesn't work like I was expecting, the first mode, Visitor Plays as You, causes the host player to lose control over game input in favor of the client player, but the second mode, Play a game with the Visitor, adds the second player as a second controller which Worms World Party doesn't support (multiplayer games only work with controller slot one so you'll need to pass the controller over to other people).

So, in order to play the game properly with Share Play a clunkier way of doing it needs to be done than I hoped. If both players have the PlayStation Plus subscription, the host has to switch to mode one (Visitor Plays as You) while player two's turn is on, and then switch to mode two (Play a game with the Visitor) when player one has to take a turn. Preferably Worms World Party is paused using either the in-game pause menu or the emulator's settings/rewind menu while switching in-between modes so that the hot-switch timer doesn't run out cutting into the player's turn timer.

You may be able to improvise if the client doesn't have PlayStation Plus by using the Share Screen function to share the host's screen while the host is playing their turn, and then turn on mode one of Share Play to relinquish control over the game. The game should also be paused during this time so as to not cut in to the turn time of either player.",2022-07-13 00:31:22,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/vxpzsu/inspecting_on_using_share_play_to_play_worms/

comment,Tag365,Do you think the Brightside alignment is real?,"Apparently there's a sort of faction war in the Worms game series. Lightsiders try to charge the enemy as much as possible, but Darksiders hide away and try to be blocked from enemy fire as much as possible.

From Worms Wiki:
""Darkside is one of several ""alignments"" or strategy types described by Team17 and the Worms community, and is considered the antithesis to Lightside. The name comes from a certain film reference as well as the general behavior of the team: Darksiders stay underground; Lightsiders keep to the surface.""
""Lightside is an opposing front of playing style besides Darksiders on Team17 and the Worms community. It also comes from the same film reference as well as the general behavior of the team: Darksiders stay underground; Lightsiders keep to the surface.""

Imo Worms Rumble is bad by the looks of it but I didn't play it so I can't really judge it, I think that Real-time Worms game could work If they would handle it differently, instead of teasing it as a next big Worms game they should have announced it as a spin-off along side a new big strategy 2D or 3D game. I remember watching that ""Worms 2020 Teaser"" seeing a Worms breaking a TV with 2D games and I was really hyped because I thought that it will be a new 3D game.

I didn't played much Armageddon either but I didn't have to to know that it's the same as World Party with different menu and missions.

I never played Battle Islands, I forgot about it's existence to be honest, I'll have to check it one day. If it comes to the ports to the less powerful hardware even if the port is bad I kinda like it? I just adore the fact that they were working with limitations and had to do what they could, also they sometimes add some cool features - I remember that GBA port of WWP had a bonus weapon which was a chainsaw sadly there was no fire mechanic and the controls were problematic due too small amount of buttons on GBA.",2022-07-07 13:14:12,2,

I think that Rumble's failure is Team17's fault because of the way they announced it, I heard that the game is not bad and can be fun, but I don't think that anyone wanted a real-time worms game instead of a mainline game. I thought that teased ""Worms 2020"" would be a new 3D game and I got really hyped then the Worms Rumble trailer dropped and well I was just disappointed. If it were a preorder bonus or just a spin-off game announced alongside a new 3D/2D turn based game then people would probably like it and it would be alive, sadly T17 decided that they need to hop on the Battle Royal train and everyone will love WR. The best thing that happened with the release of WR is that worms can have full outfits with hoodies and stuff like that, they are kinda cute.",2022-07-08 00:55:01,2,

*Create a new image with File/New

*Set size to 960x400

*Open advanced and set Fill With to Transparency

*Start drawing. Remember to use a sharp brush for the outline as worms only allows for either transparent or opaque pixels, nothing in-between

*Choose Image/Mode/Indexed

*Choose Optimum Palette, 79 Colors, disable dithering of transparency. Set dithering to Positioned (you can try the other modes too, but positioned or disabled usually look best)

*Choose Image/Mode/RGB

*Set the background color to something exotic. I'm using magic pink (255/0/255) here. The color shouldn't appear anywhere inside your image.

*Choose Layer/New Layer

*Set Layer Fill Type to Background Color

*Drag the pink layer below your original one

*Choose Image/Flatten Image

*Choose Image/Mode/Indexed

*Set Maximum number of colors to 80

*Choose Colors/Map/Rearrange Colormap

*Drag your transparent color to the first slot

*Choose File Save As

*Go to the DATA/CUSTOM/GFX folder inside your worms directory

*Enter a name and make it end in .PCX (only use 8 alphanumeric chars in front of the .PCX)

*Find the worms link in your start menu

*Right-click and choose Properties

*Remove -c ""exit"" from the commandline

*Open notepad

*Open dosboxWORMS.conf in your worms directory

*Scroll to the bottom and put a # in front of call WORMS and exit

*Save

*Open the worms link

*On the commandline enter (where MYLEVEL.PCX is the filename you used while saving and PLAYLVL.PCX is another 8 char filename that will be used for the level name):
cd data
cd custom
cd gfx
gfxcon MYLEVEL.PCX PLAYLVL.PCX

*You can now start the game again

Unfortunately I realized that in game the map was floating above the water just by a bit, so I went back to the editor to update it and it wouldn't work. I then tried deleting the original workshop item so that I could reupload it as a new map, which also is not working. When I try to upload a map, it simply says ""Failed to update content on Steam Workshop."" Steam is saying that Worms is failing to sync with the cloud but whenever the game or editor is open it says it that is synced, and every time I try to manually sync it, it fails. I have no clue what I could be doing wrong and there are pretty much no resources out there I could find that can help save for one Steam discussion that basically says ""reinstall steam"" which means reinstalling every other game I have and heck no I am **not** doing that. I'm at a loss because it worked and now suddenly it won't. I have tried restarting Steam too and that does practically nothing at all. Any ideas for what a newbie like me could be messing up here?

I assume you're not super familiar with the Worms series, while there are specially drawn maps the games can also generate terrain with a texture (in your case, a cobblestone-type one) and then pepper it with props. That might've been what happened, but I can't say I know the games by their props well.

In that case, I'd say to buy Armageddon. They're both functionally the same game, but Armageddon has significantly more modern support.

There's also the chance of it being [Revolution](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200170/Worms_Revolution/) or [Clan Wars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233840/Worms_Clan_Wars/), though I kinda doubt it because those games have 2.5D graphics and you mentioned it being an old computer.

Unfortunately, I can't verify which of these contains the hot dog stand, sorry. Just wanted to narrow it down.

Details:
I scoured the internet looking at famous worm schemes from the World Party/Armageddon era and created modern versions. My worm buddies & I also got experimental & created some of our own fun & funky concepts depending on what mood we were in. These modes have been tested and refined over the course of 2 years. We‚Äôre all mostly teachers, so we had a lot of time on our hands over Covid Break in Spring 2020.

WMD scheme creator is limited in what you can and cannot do compared to older worms games. I won‚Äôt complain about that here, but there are more customizable scheme options from Armageddon 2 that we wish we had.

Each mode in the Drive has an idea behind it. I am currently in the process of going through and writing highlighted notes for any specific rules (when present), I may also write the general idea for you to choose which modes you want to use.

Most modes do not incorporate vehicles or crafting, but some do!

I hope you guys give it a look. Also realize you can make a copy of the ‚ÄúBlank Scheme‚Äù doc and write down your own fun schemes to easily share with others. If you do write down your own schemes, please share the file with me and I can upload it to the shared Scheme folder!

We also have generated map #‚Äôs of maps that were particularly awesome. I will create a folder with these for you to also look at and choose from.

DM me for the link. I think that‚Äôs a good place to start.

Hit me up if you want to join our Worm Parties on X-Box!

We tried our hardest to get into last squad standing and it made a game with two squads, squad one was 3 of us, squad two was 2 of us and a random. There was nobody else in the game.

We then did a ‚Äúlast worm standing‚Äù and it was a battle of 6 of us plus 2 pubbies, one of which the same pub from the game before (big up Bright eyes)

I'm by no means a tech or expert, but when games crash at launch or just doesn't open on Steam, it can be related to the recognition of the GPU, so maybe you can try to reinstall the drivers?

submission,humsipums,Weird thing happened when I was a kid,"Hey all! During the end of the 90s I had a Worms game on my old PC. It was either Worms 1 or Worms 2. I remember I did some weird thing by alt-tabing out of the game, did something (very vague, I know) and when I tabbed into the game again the music changed. I did this several times. The music was awesome too. It was as if I unlocked some cheat code, must have been an intended feature I accidentally activated. 

I have today, 20-25 years later still not been able to figure out what the heck I did back then to trigger this and it remains black magic to me. 

I also know this is very vague and you might not have a clue what the heck I'm talking about, but does anybody by any chance whatsoever know what this phenomenon could have been? I think about it far too often than what it's worth thinking about lol

Could also have been Worms Director's cut but that's only for Amiga from what I can google. I remember it to be a bit different but not too different from Worms on PS1",2022-04-22 16:03:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/u9i2oi/weird_thing_happened_when_i_was_a_kid/

comment,KimhariNotPass,New Player to W.M.D.,"The training missions are quite good for basics including stuff like grenade timers and how the bazooka is affected by the wind. The campaigns are quite good for learning options for crafting.

Red magnets attract, blue magnets repel. 

You can set the number of turns it will take for a w1 rocket strike and an unwanted birthday present to hit by using the same button as you would for altering the grenade timer. (Just learned this tonight myself!)

You can drop certain weapons from ropes and jetpacks by using secondary fire (check controls in the pause menu).

There's a glitch which allows you to use two weapons in one turn by crafting the tunnel kit and entering then exiting a vehicle. Watch out for it when playing online.

So I've been googling a bit but have been unable to find a clear answer yet.

On the flip side entertaining points are worked out as a product of how many kills, how much damage was delivered and how many super weapons a worm/team used.


The thing is, if somebody uses lots of super weapons (these are like concrete donkey etc) then they get lots of kills, obviously making them the entertaining team, but their turns take longer and so they also get more boring points!

comment,Crayondalorian,We should get a worms 3d remastered,"I've been thinking this for many years. It has so much potential! I don't care what anyone says, Worms 3D was peak worms. Although, if a remastered version is all you want, **Worms Ultimate Mayhem** is probably exactly what you're looking for. 

 A few years after Worms 3D, Forts Under Siege, and Worms 4, Team17 released **WUM**, which is basically just a remastered combination of Worms 3D and 4: Mayhem. It's by far my favorite Worms game. As far as modern/current systems go, PC may be your best and *only* option though.

 Now in regards to a proper sequel to Worms 3D, I couldn't agree more. I've been trying to come up with a way to make this happen myself for a long time. I even considered creating an online petition. The key is getting enough people on board. It's simply a matter of convincing Team17 that there's still an interest and a market for 3D worms games.

 For the past 4 years I've been assembling a community of active **WUM** players on Steam. We recently hit 500 members. I call it the [Worms Ultimate Mayhem Militia](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/wummilitia). If ever there were a group of active, like-minded Worms 3D fans, this is it. 

 Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy on Steam, join our group, and let's put some ideas together! This is a unique time in the history of Worms. We must strike while the iron is hot. Rumble was a catastrophic failure that completely missed the mark and sent Team17 back to the drawing board.

Does anyone know if a ps4 controller is compatible, and if so, how to make it work?

submission,Heavy_Intention6323,What of the following has been forward-ported from W2 to the newest versions of WA?,"I used to play WA and WWP quite avidly years back, but the fact that WA has been continually developed has kind of eluded me all these years. I know that WWP feature integration is planned further down the line, but what about W2? I've just watched a single player playthrough (not all of it obviously, since it was over 5h), and I've noticed that W2 seemingly had some worthwhile stuff that it'd be nice to see ported into WA. Probably has been discussed to death too. So could someone knowledgeable let me know which of the following has already been made available in WA?   


\- Colored water - I've only seen the usual blue water in WA and WWP, was a bit surprised that W2 had several water colors going, making it a bit more abstract.  
\- The W2 worm death animation - it was actually kinda charming! I know porting the gravestone itself was probably trivial, but the death anim?   
\- The music - I've noticed it's quite different from what I was used to in WA and WWP, are there considerations to add it to the shuffle list? It'd definitely mix things up a little.  


Huh, that's all there is apparently! Of course I'm aware that there were also two weapons in W2 that didn't carry over to WA and WWP, but I think the Homing Cluster Bomb and Homing Airstrike are derivative, redundant and unbalanced, so no one probably even wants them back.

https://worms2d.info/Schemes  
In the lobby they will ask you if you know the rules to root out players who don't comply.  
  

use the chat and talk to people they'll help


Rope based gamemodes:
>shopper(easiest),  
 (p)roper  

You use the rope to pick up a crate and then drop a weapon on the highest health enemy [enter]:
  >attack from rope  
crate before attack  
kill the leader

Gamemodes with extra rule:  
>wxw,  fly,  surf

like shopper, but you have to perform an extra action, like touching a wall before attacking  

races:
>rr(rope race), ttrr, bigrr, tower

No fighting. Everyone places their worm at the start location. Goal is to get to finish fastest.  
there is also non-rope races with bingee, chute,...

If you want to get into roping i suggest races. there is no consequence for messing up (except plop*) and you can admire peoples skills.  

else stick to non-rope games like:
>normal, intermediate, Team17,   
BnG, BnA, Hysteria, Supersheep

comment,puffandgo,I can't find Worms 3D. It's not on Steam and not even on GOG. Where?,"When i look up Worms3D download on google, the first 2 links i get from 'MyAbandonware' and 'oldgamesdownload' are both safe and functional downloads. I have done both of them.

Though it requires from 30minutes up to 2 hours of fiddling, depending on your experience with 'mounting' of ISO files, since the files you download are ISO files, which need to be manually 'mounted' as CD files on your computer in order for them to function just like the original CD. The exact instructions are on both the pages on the websites themselves, below the download button.

I noticed the 'oldgamesdownload' (the second link) is a little easier on the instructions. But the deeper instructions on the 'mounting' i think is in a useful link on the first website, with that, you'll get the mount fixed up. Unless you're not patient at all, since i see most people comment it doesn't work. But i see that's just because they screw up the mounting process. I did it in 1 hour.

Just know that the mouse controls are inverted up&down and there are no key binding settings on pc. Very strange. I enjoy it purely for the nostalgia, but for the gameplay experience (w/ full mouse control and key binding settings); just download Worms ultimate mayhem on Steam.

One tip on the mounting, once you are halfway through the instructions and you do the right click on the file to click the 'mount' option and it isn't there, you need to right click the folder file > Open with... > Choose new method > click the original Windows way as standard, which is; File explorer. Sometimes people have a different explorer thing as standard, which removes the mount option. If it doesn't work, you'll have to look up ""no mount option on (xyz) windows"" and you'll get your instructions.

Be patient with the mounting. Doing it in the correct steps slowly makes it way smoother.",2024-09-30 16:10:05,1,

submission,Afoba03,What makes an artilery game good?,"Hey everyone!

Before starting I will just leave a little disclaimer that, despite not being entirely related to worms, I am taking some reference from the 2D games of the franchise and I found no more appropriate places to ask this question.

I am an aspiring game developer wanting to do something like Worms, a passion project, let us put it that way. Ever since I was little, I fell in love with the worms franchise. I found the games extremely fun and, recently, have regained interest in it. In fact, I just bought armaggedon, since it is on sale on steam! 

Anyways, I have made a previous post comparing the 2D and 3D versions of the franchise. Everybody gave me a lot of insight in the games that are of their interest. A lot of people also commented about the movement in the 2D games feeling way more fluid, especially thanks to roping. Ropes are a tool I never found out useful when I was little, and so I was baffled with this information.

I am trying to make this game on Roblox. While I wanted to do something like worms and I tried asking what you, worms players, like, I found a pretty big roadblock regarding the mentioned roping. The engine allow for ropes, however said ropes are not collideable and so would clip through the objects. I have, however, completed my random map generator and let's say I am proud of myself on that regard.

This time, instead of asking in the franchise alone, I would like to know what you all think makes a game in this genre good. Examples such as Scorched Earth, as far as my research goes, has a lot of appreciation but it is certainly nothing like Worms! 
Thank you so much for reading and I hope to see you in the comments.",2022-01-31 03:11:41,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/sgqqlg/what_makes_an_artilery_game_good/

comment,StepS_,Fog of war mechanic in Worms?,"This is already a thing with Project X custom schemes in Worms Armageddon. ""Fog of War Mole Shopper"" and ""Fog of War Capture the Flag"" were part of the release package of PX 0.8.0 in August 2011. You can read more here: [https://px.worms2d.info](https://px.worms2d.info) however the mod only works with a very old version of the game, [3.6.31.0](https://3.6.31.0).

Played lots of FoW games back in the day. Your own worms emit a small aura of light around them and there's also an item called Light Tower which can be installed onto terrain to provide additional light. Aiming weapons acts as a flashlight. Smoke Grenades create visual smoke to disorient opponents. The flag in the CtF mode was a special object and the whole gameplay was scripted specifically for this mode. In CtF, there are a bunch of teleporter pads and toxic slime drums placed around the map.

I don't have screenshots of this anymore.

A lot of the WA schemes are about movement, either precise or fast. The roping is what allows that in a fun way because it is an easy to learn hard to master skill.

The first link is the CWT (biggest yearly Worms tournament) 2021 final, and the whole games are (indirectly) about taking the higher ground and making your opponent use all their ropes and utilities aka making him unable to move around the map.

The second link is more directly roping: the Warmer scheme is like a showcase of rope tricks

A lot of other schemes make smart use of the rope like the trick races, rope races, warmer, etc. You can look about them on worms2d.info",2022-01-14 06:41:02,3,

I‚Äôve never been part of that extreme roping scene, but they certainly get a lot of use in our little group‚Äôs games and it usually leads to hilarity watching people try to fancily cross the map using them.

It just adds so much mobility and potential for amusing turns.",2022-01-14 11:47:39,2,

The 3D games take what's wrong with most non-Armageddon games with the more restrained Worm physics and amplify it tenfold. Which I totally understand, since the 3D games needed to be able to work in a smaller area. due to the hardware at the time, but it ends up making them just not as fun for me. Maybe if they gave it another shot with better tech.",2022-01-13 22:41:52,3,

comment,cheesycoke,"What makes you prefer the 2D games over the 3D games, and vice versa?","The way I always explain it, when talking purely as a casual player, the movement and physics are just more fun/silly. In Armageddon worms have more of a tendency to fly further, bounce more often, and slide around whereas in other games they don't fly around as much and have a tendency to ""stick.""",2022-01-14 01:53:22,2,
comment,dieego98,"What makes you prefer the 2D games over the 3D games, and vice versa?","Another cool thing about Armageddon is the skill cap! As it is a pixel game, you can measure every shot in a perfect way. This allows a lot of creativity and replay value, there is always new things to learn even after 24 years. I've seen players with 15 years of experience in the game learning new stuff. While that is possible in non-pixel games, it usually needs a player base a lot bigger than what Worms has, for some players to get to a high level. That high skill cap is why WA is still the Worms game with the most active online community :)",2022-01-14 06:49:23,2,

I gave it a play on Xbox and enjoyed it, but really wanted old school keyboard and mouse controls.

So I finally installed on PC through GamePass and bizarrely I can move right, but not left when I use the keyboard. First thought is my A button must be broken, so I tried it in the key mapping in optins and it noticed A fine, still no movement. So I remapped it to a different key, nothing.

Used a controller and I can move left fine.

submission,None,Our Worms game rules,"I have been playing Worms Clan wars for over 500 hours with my friend, and in the beginning we invented our own game mode just to keep a challenge and to think a bit more. 
So the point is to win, but there are four kinds of wins; 
- Winning with one worm is an intensive win
- Two worm win is almost as bad as losing
- Three worms is a casual win
- Four worms or more is an easy win

4>1>3>2

If you want to make it more challenging, you can try to get a ""+ win"", which you get if one of your worms has 69 health points. The more 69 worms you have, the more +'s (Easy++, Intensive+ etc.)

One of the key points to make the game mode work is not to have any weapons in the beginning apart from Prod. Utilitieswise you should have 6 Blowtorches, infinite ropes (we play with 2 swings), 6 drills, 4 girders, 1 telekinesis, 1 parachute (1 delay), 1 monkey, 1 sentry (1 delay), 1 sinkhole, 1 magnet (1 delay).

Two crates/utility spawns per round is good.
When you collect a weapon crate, even from crate strike, you have to tell your rival what you got and you have to use it. If you don't have the time to use it for whatever reason, you can't use it on your enemy anymore otherwise you will lose. But if you do use it on  an enemy worm, your rival won't get an ""intense win, casual win"" etc. from that, but a normal win. 
If you collect more than one weapon crate on your turn, you don't need to tell what you got from those crates and you don't have to use them as long as they are collected BEFORE using the first weapon.
So if you have a weapon you didn't use when you were supposed to and you collect a new weapon, you have to tell what you got and you can't use that either until you have used the first one.
You don't need to tell anything about the utilities you have collected. 
If you collect a weapon crate when you have for example 5 seconds of ""retreat time"" and it's the first weapon collected, you have to use the weapon on your upcoming turn. Stealing a weapon from the other player he/she is supposed to use does not mean you have to use the stolen weapon.

If you have only ONE worm left and you don't use the weapon you are supposed to, you will lose. BUT if the weapon you are supposed to use is Kamikaze, then you don't have to use it. You CANNOT use any Airstrikes, Super sheep, Concrete donkey, Bunker buster, Lightning strike, Homing missile on the enemy's last worm.

It typically means bad things for your invading worm since you have to choose between either letting your worm get picked apart until it's his turn again, or using a Select Worm early in the match to give him a better chance (or escape). But for the cost of a gas grenade and 1 worm, you can potentially take two (or more!) worms down to 1 hp if you play it slow after the invasion.

submission,Scheiwidei,Our own rules for Worms,"I have been playing Worms Clan wars for over 500 hours with my friend, and in the beginning we invented our own game mode just to keep a challenge and to think a bit more. 
So the point is to win, but there are four kinds of wins; 
- Winning with one worm is an intensive win
- Two worm win is almost as bad as losing
- Three worms is a casual win
- Four worms or more is an easy win

4>1>3>2

If you want to make it more challenging, you can try to get a ""+ win"", which you get if one of your worms has 69 health points. The more 69 worms you have, the more +'s (Easy++, Intensive+ etc.)

One of the key points to make the game mode work is not to have any weapons in thx beginning apart from Prod. Utilitieswise you should have 6 Blowtorches, infinite ropes (we play with 3 swings), 6 drills, 4 girders, 1 telekinesis, 1 parachute (1 delay), 1 monkey, 1 sentry (1 delay), 1 sinkhole, 1 magnet (1 delay).

Three crate spawns per round.
When you collect a weapon crate, even from crate strike, you have to tell your rival what you got and you have to use it. If you don't have the time to use it for whatever reason, you can't use it on your enemy anymore otherwise you will lose. But your rival won't get a certain kind of win from that, only a normal win. So even if the winning team has plenty of 69 worms at the time, it won't be considered a + win.
If you collect more than one weapon on your turn, you don't need to tell what you got from those crates and you don't have to use them on your next turn.
You don't need to tell anything about the utilities you have collected. 
If you collect a weapon crate when you have for example 5 seconds of ""retreat time"" and it's the first weapon collected, you have to use the weapon on your next turn. Stealing a weapon from the other player he is supposed to use does not mean you have to use the stolen weapon on your upcoming turn.

If you have only one worm left and you don't use the weapon you are supposed to, you will lose. BUT if the weapon you are supposed to use is Kamikaze, you don't have to use it.
You CANNOT use any Airstrikes, Super sheep, Concrete donkey, Bunker buster, Lightning strike, Homing missile or Boggy B on the enemys LAST worm. And if the weapon causes any damage to the other player's last worm, you will lose.

I bet there is plenty of essential information I did not write about, but feel free to ask.",2021-11-29 08:56:37,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/r4roq4/our_own_rules_for_worms/

If I remember correctly WMD worked for me on Linux using steam's own emulation (which is based on wine but with some extra stuff), not running it through wine. So I would try installing steam directly and running it through that.

I also needed to explicitly specify which graphics driver to use before running it, so you might need to add `export MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=i965` in your environment before you launch steam.",2021-11-28 16:46:58,2,

comment,SpyX2,"Can someone explain key differences/compare W.M.D, Armageddon, Reloaded, Revolution, and Ultimate Mayhem? Except for obvious things like being 2D or 3D","I for myself use rather personalized generation system when categorizing the Worms games. It goes like this.

+ 1st Gen: Worms, Worms: Director's Cut

+ 2nd Gen: Worms 2, Worms Armageddon, Worms World Party

+ 3rd Gen: Worms 3D, Worms Forts: Under Siege, Worms 4 Mayhem

+ 4th Gen: Worms Open Warfare series, Worms XBLA series, Reloaded (+ Worms 2: Armageddon on mobile)

+ 5th Gen: Worms Revolution, Worms Clan Wars, Worms Battlegrounds (also Worms 3 on mobile)

+ 6th Gen: Worms WMD, Worms 4 on mobile

Remakes and re-releases belong in the gen they were originally released in. Now, to the differences and key traits of each generation:

+ 1st Gen: Very basic Worms, with a handful of notable differences. For example, a worm's turn doesn't end if he takes damage.

+ 2nd Gen: The ""classic"" Worms era. Ninja Ropes and a (perhaps unnecessarily) high variety of moderately-balanced weapons dominate the battlefield. No weapon is particularly tricky: Their differences come in things like damage, accuracy and knockback. Utilities also mostly just let the player get from point A to point B, with only a handful of exceptions such as Girders and Freeze. And even they are very simple to understand. Once in a blue moon, you might come across a ridiculously powerful and equally bizarre weapon, such as the Martyn Brown Bomb.

+ 3rd Gen: Transitioning to 3D also gave us a cut in weapons that were deemed unnecessary by Team17. This is where Armageddon's huge arsenal shows: weapons such as the Handgun, the Bow, and Dragon Ball were all cut seemingly because they were so very very similar to existing weapons. To compensate for the loss of weapons, Mayhem introduced Armageddon-esque super weapons such as Alien Abduction, Bubble Trouble and Bovine Blitz. These are more defensive than the ones we saw in Armageddon, likely to help newer players more. The different gameplay in Forts also tackled the issue of less-limited movement in 3D landscape while Ultimate decided to embrace the more ""brainless"" side of Worms that doesn't require so much aiming and artillery skills. (Which is why Worms 3D can be considered the better game of the two, ignoring the spin-offy Forts.)

+ 4th Gen: Returning to 2D, Team17 didn't want to just repeat what they did in Armageddon. Taking advantage of the more powerful hardware (and also their experience), they developed interesting new tools and weapons that behave like things never seen before, such as the Electromagnet and the Lightning Strike. There are also other more sophisticated tools for strategy, such as Worship, Boomerang and Steal. Some of these tools never came back after being introduced here.

+ 5th Gen: Perhaps the most unique 2D Worms generation, this is the first and so far the only place we have seen Worms classes. The main games in this generation also feature dynamic physics and water that open up hundreds of new possibilities. New weapons are introduced to fully take advantage of the dynamic water system, and Clan Wars also sees a couple of 4th gen esque tools such as the Lucky Charm that improves weapon efficiency while slowly generating health and Oxygen that makes Worms immune to suffocating and toxic gases. Oh, and you can also use coins to buy weapons, if you don't like being given random weapons from crates. No, this isn't an EA game: You get the coins from in-game coin crates *available equally for everyone*. 

+ 6th Gen: Axing the classes (which were apparently difficult to balance?) and dynamic physics (which wouldn't have fit the new art style?), WMD tries to once again go with the more sophisticated touch with its vehicles and buildings. Replacing the coin system we have weapon crafting, which takes into account that you shouldn't be able to use the same resources to get yourself a Cluster Bomb and a Concrete Donkey. Without classes, the gameplay tends to focus more on player choice instead of the situation itself. In 5th Gen, you'd often have your turn dictated by the class you're playing as while in WMD, you can do whatever you like. This does reduce the weight of the choices you make when placing your worms, which isn't entirely a positive thing.

Conclusion: Mayhem is to 3D what Brawl is to Melee. If you enjoy more casual gameplay, absolutely go for it, because then the former is simply superior. But if you like more sophisticated weapons such as the Uzi (and the Ninja Rope not having a ridiculously powerful ability that removes most of the strategy when allowed by the scheme) and choosing where your Worms spawn via Teleport In, Worms 3D is easily the better choice. In comparison to 2D games, Mayhem is often sort of like playing on a map that doesn't limit your mobility at all, which is usually just a flat island, though the game does come with a handful of maps clearly intended for more skillful play.

When it comes to 2D, the ""big names"" are the ones you mentioned: Armageddon, WMD, Reloaded and Revolution (or Clan Wars; they're almost the exact same game). Your preference comes down to what you want to see in your Worms game: Armageddon has the most weapons, but their uniqueness and balance can be questioned. Ninja Rope is ridiculously powerful in that game and if not limited enough it can render the strategy down to ""rope your way to the worm and shoot him"", which is pretty similar to Mayhem's Grappling Hook tactics. If you want the differences in weapons to be more meaningful, you might want to go for Reloaded. There's still some weapons missing, but their balance has been improved. And the new weapons are an absolute blast, both metaphorically and literally.

Revolution and Clan Wars have the unique physics going for them, even if you don't like the class system. Many do enjoy coming up with a greater strategy with their choices of worms, though. Splashing around with dynamic water and trying to find ways to use the elements in your advantage still feels fresh to this day. But if that's simply too much for you, go for WMD: its vehicles and buildings don't exactly change the game all that much. It also has the classic rope physics, if that's a deal breaker for you, though the bigger maps help make it more balanced than what it was in Armageddon.

TLDR: Using Armageddon as the base experience, Reloaded is the one with a small arsenal of unique and balanced weapons without any other gameplay enhancements, Revolution has classes and dynamic objects while still retaining Reloaded's approach to weapons to a certain degree, and WMD is somewhere between the two in its gimmicks. Mayhem is widely a more casual experience than the rest due to its map pool, though some of them do offer meaningful competition with the right scheme.",2021-11-25 16:49:36,17,

Does anyone know why this is happening and what can I do about it :(? I have done some reasearch but it seems like no one had this issue and the solutions didn't work for me. And it seems that this is the only game that has this issue.

comment,Virtual-Knight,What makes Armageddon the best in the series?,"It's had a recent update, most probably because of it's popularity, which is surprising for a game released in 1999. I've been playing Worms for years, my first Worms game was United, but I've not played all of them. I've been playing it a lot recently. It's got a very popular online community, too. It's easy to get hooked on it. 

One thing I like about it, it's easy to add mods to it, you can make your own flags, speechbanks and victory themes.

You can download many community-made mods for it from this site.

comment,Lexaraj,What makes Armageddon the best in the series?,"The funny thing is that, other than main menu aesthetics, Worms World Party was *technically* a better game than Armageddon when it first came out. It was basically just Armageddon with a few additional features.

The problem was that very few people (rightfully) felt like the small number of features were worth the price of a full game re-purchase, so most everyone stuck with Armageddon. In addition, they had/have separate online servers so the fact that most people stuck with Armageddon pretty much had WWP's online dead on arrival.

Even funnier, when they released WWP: Remastered the *exact* same thing happened all over again and everything continued playing Armageddon. Armageddon has since received modern updates since and is a more complete game the WWP as a whole now, so there's basically no reason at all to buy/play it.",2021-11-13 14:51:04,1,

submission,None,Are there some kind of cheats for Worms W.M.D?,"Just now had 1v1 match with some guy that seems to be using some kind of lag glitch. First of all, he doesn't spawn the worm in time, it spawns automatically and after moment changes to where he intended (although failed).

Afterwards, he ropes around and goes blub blub. After a moment what do you know, the worm that drowned is right next to mine in house.

Not going after some previous experiences when a player just connects to 1v1, leaves the game and somehow I'm the one who loses the match.

So my question is - are there some kind of cheats / glitches that unfair players use that I should be aware of? Makes the game unplayable.",2021-10-14 14:36:48,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/q8112r/are_there_some_kind_of_cheats_for_worms_wmd/
comment,ieatpubes_wmd,Are there some kind of cheats for Worms W.M.D?,"Which platform are you playing on? I haven't played in a couple of months, but I haven't seen the ones you're talking about.

There are 3 that I know of:

1. Tunnel Kit Glitch: Use the tunnel kit 1 or 2 times, but not all 3. Hop in a mounted gun, or in a vehicle. Hop out. You can now choose another weapon and attack again.
2. Double Drop: You can do this on a jet pack, parachute, or on a ninja rope (but only if you have 0 swings left). While utilizing any of the mentioned utilities, equip a mine or dynamite. Press B+A at the same time (Switch controls for jump + use weapon). Your worm will detach from the utility and drop the weapon. Jump away quickly! But you can now drop another by pressing A again. If you stack the mines next to one another by hitting B+A,A very quickly, the second explosion will go off very quickly after the first, launching the worm even further than normal, and will nearly double your damage. Caveat: If you only have 1 mine or dynamite, your turn will run out, and you can't move, but your opponent's turn will never begin. Therefore, if you know you're going to lose a match, you can force your opponent to choose between waiting for forever, or quitting and taking a loss. Super cheap.
3. Drillboat Glitch: If you're in a cavern match in the Liberation theme, you can use a drillboat in the bottom right corner of the map and break through the ""indestructible"" barrier. You can then hop on top of the drillboat and jetpack up to the top of the indestructible border. If you want to be \*really\* cheap, you can combo this with the double drop, but drop 1 mine, run away, wait for the timer to go all the way to sudden death, and then drop the 2nd one. You'll take 45 damage, but then it'll be sudden death and your opponent will have an extremely difficult time taking you out.

I submitted a bug report to Team17 about the 1st one over a year ago and they've done absolutely nothing. There's no point in filing bug reports for the other two. Lazy wastes of space. I'll never buy another game of theirs again. Shame, because I think WMD could have been better than Armageddon if they paid it any attention and made some fixes & updates.",2021-10-14 15:14:15,4,

submission,Ketamine-Kev,"is worms rumble, like, proper dead or what?","I've played Worms games for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories is being like 5 and jamming the Worms Xbox live arcade game. Worms 2: Armageddon is the most nostalgic game of all time to me. I pre-ordered every new game like a true consoomer just because it's worms up until W.M.D.

Then by some miracle a Series X graced my possession a couple weeks ago, then a week after that I grabbed the Fully Loaded physical disc of Worms Rumble. If I'm being honest, seeing the case on the shelf was the first I'd heard about this game. It was buzzy.

My internet maxes out at like 8Mbps, so it takes like 2 hours to install the game lmao, but once it does I load up the game and play the tutorial. ""Holy shit, a side-scroller battle royale? that's kind of a great idea. Wow, the way they've reinvented the weapons mechanics is great, this game is gonna be so much fun!"" were the thoughts mostly going through my head playing it. I was enthralled. This was gonna be the best Worms game ever made.

And then I tried to find a match.

An hour passed.

Two hours passed.

278 further minutes passed.

""Bruh, wtf?"" I turned the game off, did a bit of research. The Series X version of this game came out of June in this year?!?!?!?! Is it really this dead already? Is it my internet? 

This game is just fuckin buzzy bro.",2021-10-04 02:53:31,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/q0wtun/is_worms_rumble_like_proper_dead_or_what/
comment,KarBoy2314PL,"is worms rumble, like, proper dead or what?","i gave this game less than a year for its lifetime... guess I was right

any games from the Worms series past Armageddon (so World Party and further) are to be considered cash grabs usually, as they have no idea what that franchise really means to players that actually play

oh, and if you really want Worms, go get Armageddon, it's on Steam and GoG",2021-10-04 06:03:21,3,
comment,Mista-Smegheneghan,"is worms rumble, like, proper dead or what?","Rumble at least didn't seem like a cash grab on initial glance, in my eyes at the least. The annoying thing about game development is there's a need to innovate to stop things turning stale and to stop sales falling off. Rumble seemed like a test of changing the gameplay like the 3D games, except instead of changing the dimensions in play, they changed up a core aspect to make it more action-oriented. It turns out this being tied to a big multiplayer scheme thing was a *bold* attempt at changing the formula, but the usual gamble of ""servers are ghost towns after a while"" coming up empty again is less a surprise as it is an inevitability.

Though I have the feeling that telling you this isn't gonna change much cause you're willing to write off WMD as a cash-grab too, the game that so closely resembled Armageddon and was actually quite decent to play, even if it adopted many of the weird foibles of the series with better scaling graphics.",2021-10-04 09:55:04,2,

They gave it some effort but it's sorely lacking in features and had the potential to be a modern classic. At least it's less likely to be abandoned than Rumble considering it'll still have its fans and it'll work on a 1v1 basis; you can't do that with a 32-player online game outside of LAN games or online revival events.",2021-10-04 15:04:11,1,
comment,ieatpubes_wmd,"is worms rumble, like, proper dead or what?","Sorry, but it's already been abandoned. I've sent multiple support tickets to Team 17 showing them how I can, in a single turn, use the tunnel kit, fly around in a chopper, and then use another weapon. If you have enough time, you can actually rinse and repeat. Use the tunnel kit for two uses on Worm A, get in the chopper. Fly to Worm B, use the tunnel kit 2x on them. Get in the chopper, fly to Worm C, etc. 30 damage to each worm and then one larger weapon at the end.

I'll wait until they patch that one before I submit a follow-up where you can use two mines or dynamite in one turn, too.

On consoles, people use the glitches with impunity. On PC since there's a chat feature you'll get some flak, but there's nothing stopping you from doing it. As a software engineer, these are both ridiculously easy to patch.

It's been over a year. Game's broken, and dead. Team17 has no interest. They're already busy working on the next broken game they can ~~sell you~~ use to swindle you.

I'm not surprised the devs have moved on, they have more current work to handle; but I can certainly see the annoyance on the players' side of things with regards to it being left to weirdos who find the glitches and exploit 'em.",2021-10-04 17:17:00,1,

This Saturday we have a spectacular event planned in the world of competitive Worms Armageddon!

###80hp Cup | Grand Final | Dario Vs. Mablak | Saturday 25th September @ 8pm GMT Live @ https://www.twitch.tv/Komito8220###

For context, Dario, Mablak and chuvash are widely regarded by the competitive community as the top 3 competitive players in the Intermediate scheme of all time.

A while back, Dario created a variant of 'Intermediate' called '80hp' which is a more aggresive and creative variant which promotes a faster pace of gameplay and quicker/shorter matches.

If you enjoy watching highly skilled players compete, you won't want to miss it!

A brief description of 80hp by Dario:

**Rules & Highlights:**
Better played in bo3 or more games. 8 worms. Each round you can choose only one type of special/team weapon to use:  pigeons (x2), sheep launcher (x1), aqua-sheep (x1), holy hand grenade (x1), flamethrower (x1), cows (x2) or old woman (x1). Moles do not count as special weapon. In different rounds you can use different special weapons. If in one round you use more than one type of special weapon, you lose the round.

**80 hitpoints:**
It makes round shorter, also makes it more rewarding to pile/reposition enemy worms with weapons that cause less than 50 damage. Raises the relevance of BnG skills above the ""why didn't I just rope and shotgun?"" level. Turns holy hand grenade and flamethrower into reliable killers.

**Balanced team weapons:**
All team weapons are available, but you are only allowed to use one kind in each round. Moles are considered a regular weapon, not a team weapon, you have 3 of them and their power is 5. Cows and HHG have a delay of 3 turns, pigeons a delay of two, and flamethrower, old woman, sheep launcher and supersheep a delay of 0. Supersheep is also now an aqua sheep. Old Woman and Sheep Launcher power is 4.

**Dyna/sheep with 1 turn delay:**
Reduces a bit the effect of first turn piles. Makes Old Woman or Sheep Launcher a decent choice if you really need to blast that first-turn pile, at the expense of having used your team weapon in the first turn.

**Nuke SD (25hp/turn) at 10 minutes with high water rise:**
Reduces the impact of who gets the first sudden death turn and opens a new branch of tactical thinking, now water rise can be used more often as a killer. Also makes rounds a lot shorter. Turns of less than 1 second still reduce the time left until SD.

**4 ropes:**
Balances the fact that 80 hitpoints makes it easier to kill worms, increases the relevance of BnG skills and encourages the use of long range team weapons (pigeons, super sheep, holy hand grenade).

**2 shotguns:**
Forces players to look for more creative ways to cause 50 damage if 50 damage is really needed.

**35s turn time with 10 seconds hot-seat:**
makes rounds more dynamic, but it also gives more strategic players the time they need to plan ahead.

**Rope roll-drops:**
Enables using weapons with the enter key between rope swings or after detaching from bungee. This includes weapons that you can normally use while roping and also the ones usable while jumping. This opens a whole new set of possibilities where the action happens between rope swings, it may be particularly interesting for dropping animals. It also means that long bungee flights are useful now, since you can open the parachute at any point during the flight to avoid losing control of your worm.",2021-09-23 15:43:12,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/ptxzt0/dario_vs_mablak_80hp_cup_grand_final/

I've been playing this game for a few years, so it's certainly nothing new to me. Recently, I've gotten to the Hero rank in deathmatch, and it's f***** impossible. I must be on my millionth attempt. I can't imagine what elite and superhero will be like but holy crap man. I try to play as defensively as possible and block the enemy in with girders etc etc, but my best strategies only get me so far, and I end up playing for 20 minutes only to get my last worm obliterated.

submission,Kain207,Unlocking HHG,"Hello, this is my first post on this type of Reddit community and about 2 weeks ago I bought Worms Ultimate Mayhem for PC and it's been a blast due to the fact that that was one of my favorite games when I was 12. 

I've already beaten the main story and the Worms 3D story (which came in included and didn't know that, pretty pog) and I've got some of the records and challenges completed as well

The thing is... I now want to unlock all of the weapons, including the legendary HHG. 

I couldn't find anything on the internet; just some cheats and old videos... Nothing useful really...

Do I need to beat all of the challenges? Or acquire all the time records?

submission,G65434-2_II,"Worms Armageddon: Custom speech banks not working quite properly in online play, can't figure out why...","Since custom speech banks aren't transfered to opponents' computers in online play, me and my friend figured they'd probably work if each of us simply had the bank(s) the other is using and they're named identically. And it did work, but only half way - the speech bank that my team uses plays on my friend's end just fine, but on my machine it just plays the default speech bank for my friend's team.

Any idea what could be causing this? As said, we both have the same custom speech banks on our computers, they're identically named, and placed in the correct folder: User\Data\Speech\[custom bank's name] (and *not* under the DATA folder).  
The only thing I can think of off the top of my head is that I'm playing the CD version (updated to 3.8.1) while my friend has the Steam version (presumably likewise properly updated), but could that cause this kind of an issue? Shouldn't the different releases work essentially identically and be fully compatible in online play as long as they're up-to-date?

&nbsp;

EDIT: Just tested with another friend of mine. Identical setup, he having the Steam version of the game, we both having the same two custom speech banks, placed in identically named folders under [WA]/User/Speech/ - and lo and behold, everything worked as it should, both speech banks working as expected.

comment,Mista-Smegheneghan,"Worms Armageddon: Custom speech banks not working quite properly in online play, can't figure out why...","I don't think version differences should cause an issue. Dumb questions time:

* Do the speech bank folders have the same name?
* Have you checked the contents of the folder and made sure everything is where it should be? Like, when you go to `C:\Team17\Worms Armageddon\User\Speech\[FOLDER NAME]`, the folder has the Boring.wav, Bummer.wav etc there, and it's not been uncompressed improperly so it's `C:\Team17\Worms Armageddon\User\Speech\[FOLDER NAME]\[FOLDER NAME]` and *then* the .wavs?
* Your voice-bank works on your friend's computer, and I have to assume your voice-bank works on your computer; does your friend's voice-bank work on their computer?

That'll help narrow down where the issue might be - if your friend's bank works on their PC but not yours, it's likely one of the first two options.",2021-08-16 00:10:07,1,

Yes. Everything is there and working correctly in local play on my computer. If I make teams that use those two banks and play local offline, they both work correctly.

>Your voice-bank works on your friend's computer, and I have to assume your voice-bank works on your computer; does your friend's voice-bank work on their computer?

Correct, and yes. In our online games, my friend hears both his own team and mine with the correct custom speech banks, but I hear only mine correctly, my friend's team reverting to the default bank.",2021-08-16 00:50:19,1,

We'll have to double-check again next time we play, but the last time we checked and confirmed we both had the custom speech banks in the WA/User/Speech folder and not the DATA folder.

Googling around some more, I came across [this Steam forum thread](https://steamcommunity.com/app/217200/discussions/0/648811126492948721/#c648811126512052732) that seems to contradict the usual advice and says to specifically put banks under the DATA folder, although that's about restoring banks removed in the digital releases of WA, but unless I've misunderstood things, wouldn't those be considered custom banks in the current landscape anyway since they're not included by default in the digital releases?

Weird indeed. Shouldn't it basically work like ""online opponent uses custom bank named X > if you have custom bank with identical (folder) name, play sounds from that folder for opponent's team, otherwise play the default speech bank"". Not much to go wrong, yet still does somehow. :D

comment,KomitoDnB,Which is the most played worms game currently?,"Big post, worth it though:

Other than a break between 2019-2020, I've been playing Worms Armageddon actively online since 1999 with tens of thousands of hours played in various schemes and leagues.

Generally speaking, most dedicated players will agree Worms Armageddon is the best in the franchise other than those who have only played the most recent releases.

Worms Armageddon has more customization than any other title, it's perfect for extremely competitive players just as much as casual players. The sheer magnitude of customization we have with Worms Armageddon is actually magnificent and is enough to last a lifetime really, i've been playing actively myself since 1999.

You can play both single player & multiplayer both offline & online, as well as single player training, missions and deathmatch.

The physics of Worms Armageddon is peak Worms for most people, due to the specific game engine that gives Worms Armageddon a vast depth that other games lack.

From being able to create your own custom maps and share them with the community, to full control over custom scheme settings even down to individual seconds and power/ammo/delay settings and much more! Not to mention the amazing wormkit modules that enhance gameplay for everyone making it even better:

https://worms2d.info/WormKit

Want to hear something else amazing? Worms Armageddon is still, after 22 years being maintained and updated! The latest big release being last year with 3.8 and 3.8.1:

3.8 - https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-released-32795/

3.8.1 - https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-1-released-33051/

Here is one of the best websites to discover and learn just how much depth this game has:

https://worms2d.info/Worms_Armageddon

There is also a handy hosting service called HostingBuddy, which is an automated hosting server for people who cannot or will not host manually. You simply type !host scheme name here and HostingBuddy will host a game for you, you can read up on HostingBuddy here:

https://worms2d.info/HostingBuddy

There is also WormNAT2 - A WormKit module which enables players behind NAT or firewalls to host games which are joinable by everyone. It achieves this by hosting games on a proxy server, which redirects connections to your computer.

You can read more about hosting here:

https://worms2d.info/Hosting_Guide

There are also active leagues and competitions throughout the year:

The Ultimate Site - https://www.tus-wa.com/ - The main public and active League in the community.

Open Normal League - http://normalnonoobs.com/- The most prestegious League which focuses on the Intermediate scheme where the best Intermediate players play.

Crespo's Worms Tournament - https://cwtsite.com/ - The most prestegious once a year event for Intermediate which happens once a year, only the best of the best compete.

Think of Worms Armageddon like the Olympics, in Worms we call each set of game settings 'schemes', where in Olympics there are different 'events' or 'sports'.

Personally speaking, I break down every scheme to fit 3 categories:

Artillery - These schemes are based on being skilled with weapon accuracy and consistency like Bazooka & Grenades, schemes such as BnG, Hysteria, Aerial, Forts etc.

Strategic - These schemes focus more on planning and thinking ahead, trying to outwit your opponents and doing the right thing at the right time, as well as memorizing game mechanics and adapting to ever evolving and changing situations. Elite, Intermediate, Mole Shopper, Team17 are a few classic schemes here.

Physical - These schemes focus on physical hand eye coordination skills and mastery of mechanical abilities, a player must excel in timing, speed and have great reflexes to compete at the highest levels. Popular schemes here include Roper, Big Rope Race, Time Trial Rope Race, Wall 2 Wall Shopper, Warmer.

There are many more schemes which you can learn more about here:

https://worms2d.info/Schemes

Although it's possible to create these categories of schemes in most Worms games, they truly excel in Worms Armageddon like no other Worms game. New schemes are still being invented, especially with the new features provided by 3.8+ patches, and old Classics are still being played often by new players and some like myself who have been around since 1999.

Unfortunately most gamers don't realize the incredible depth Worms Armageddon has, most people see it as a goofy casual game, which I won't deny, is part of it's charm!

I myself have been hosting little Tournaments with small cash prizes and streaming them live on Twitch this year, here is a video for one of them:

comment,KomitoDnB,Which is the most played worms game currently?,"I don't mind at all sharing this information, most people won't bother searching already existing information, though every time I paste it, there are little changes, it's a work in progress.

I guess i'm looking at what the OP asked differently as well, i'm reading it as ""most played currently"" rather than ""most active at present"". Meaning I was looking at it like which game has been played more to this current day. Though I won't deny there was some subjective bias behind reading it that way lol.

I'm also looking at the future too, I believe Worms Armageddon will most likely last longer than W.M.D though, unfortunately due to the lack of care and attention from Team17 from experienced developers improving the game like how we have Deadcode and CyberShadow updating and maintaining Worms Armageddon. So as activity drops in W.M.D, it will remain in Worms Armageddon, although I could be wrong of course.

W.M.D has amazing potential and I wish it could see the same love and care that Worms Armageddon has seen... I've also had a few W.M.D players come into my stream talking about how buggy W.M.D is, especially the Ninja Rope.

Personally speaking I think W.M.D looks beautiful and has a few interesting features. It has the potential to have as much freedom and content as Worms Armageddon, though it feels like it has a mere fraction of the content and customization available in Worms Armageddon, and that's another perspective of ""most played"" I feel like Worms Armageddon wins on as there is more to it to be played.

EDIT - Actually something I haven't mentioned, i've got both WA and W.M.D and i'd say it's actually worth buying them both when they are on sale, they are both great games, of course it's obvious which I prefer lol, there's a few well known players who play both as well.

So yeah, from now on i'm going to encourage buying both since they are incredibly cheap when on sale.",2021-08-05 16:34:04,2,

It's been a while since I played while at school since that was back in 1999, and perhaps connecting to WormNET itself is different now, I honestly couldn't say. However back then I had no trouble connecting to WormNET itself from school connections although maybe these days security is tighter so the school itself might have some sort of app or IP blocker or something which disables you connecting to WormNET.

Though if you manage to connect to WormNET, I assume you will be able to host matches and join matches.",2021-08-03 12:39:50,1,
comment,None,Steam has a Worms Sale Right Now! Should I Buy Armageddon or WMD?,"* If the graphics of WA turn you off, one point for WMD.

* If consistency of gameplay is important, one point for WA.

* *Especially* if you want to get into serious ranked play, minus one point for WMD.

* If you want only to play with a known group of people (e.g. your friends are at your place, or if you're playing in a closed lobby), one point for WMD.

* If you want to have access to a large group of people online to play with, one point for WA.

* If you want to be more serious about custom schemes & rules, one point for WA.

Team17 has really dropped the ball on patching WMD. There are a few game-breaking bugs where you can use multiple weapons in one turn, and desyncs seem to be more prevalent there. If you want to get serious in ranked play, these can be a sore spot as there are lots of people glitching. I've informed Team17 of these bugs multiple times and they've never released a fix. I don't expect they ever will.

However, the game looks much better than WA, and buildings and vehicles are a fun twist on the game for more casual play. So if you're with a group of friends who are playing for laughs, WMD is the better game. But if you're looking to depend on the online community to play custom schemes and be more active, WA is actually the better option.",2021-08-02 20:49:53,1,
comment,KomitoDnB,Steam has a Worms Sale Right Now!

The graphics are subjective, for me WA looks better, for others WMD may look better. 

You can also play with a known group of people with your friends via hot seating, or online, or via LAN, WA also has more customization so both games get a point, although i'd actually give WA 2 points and WMD only 1 since there is more you can do with WA than WMD.

Also, WMD also had serious competitive gameplay, it's just not as dedicated or organized as competitive gameplay on WA, so again i'd give WMD one point and WA 2 points here.

comment,KomitoDnB,"Out of all 2 worms games I've played, (battlegrounds and WMD) this motherfucker holds allot more worth. Better than WMD.","Ah, I know Worms Armageddon is on consoles, although I highly doubt all the features which make it as good as it is, are on console.

At least I haven't seen any announcement of updated releases being on console, here, read this copypaste i've made which i've been posting recently here:

Big post, although worth reading if you are a fan of Worms and want important and helpful information, this focuses on what many players consider the best in the franchise.

Generally speaking, Worms Armageddon is the best in the franchise and most dedicated players will agree other than those who have only played the most recent releases.

Worms Armageddon has more customization than any other title, it's perfect for extremely competitive players just as much as casual players. The sheer magnitude of customization we have with Worms Armageddon is actually magnificent and is enough to last a lifetime really, i've been playing actively myself since 1999.

The physics of Worms Armageddon is peak Worms for most people, due to the specific game engine that gives Worms Armageddon a vast depth that other games lack.

From being able to create your own custom maps and share them with the community, to full control over custom scheme settings even down to individual seconds and power/ammo/delay settings and much more! Not to mention the amazing wormkit modules that enhance gameplay for everyone making it even better:

https://worms2d.info/WormKit

Want to hear something else amazing? Worms Armageddon is still, after 22 years being maintained and updated! The latest big release being last year with 3.8 and 3.8.1:

3.8 - https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-released-32795/

3.8.1 - https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-1-released-33051/

Here is one of the best websites to discover and learn just how much depth this game has:

https://worms2d.info/Worms_Armageddon

There is also a handy hosting service called HostingBuddy which many people use to save figuring out port forwarding to host, although I prefer to do it the manual way. If you are curious though:

https://worms2d.info/HostingBuddy

There are also active leagues and competitions throughout the year:

The Ultimate Site - https://www.tus-wa.com/ - The main public and active League in the community.

Open Normal League - http://normalnonoobs.com/- The most prestegious League which focuses on the Intermediate scheme where the best Intermediate players play.

Crespo's Worms Tournament  - https://cwtsite.com/ - The most prestegious once a year event for Intermediate which happens once a year, only the best of the best compete.

Think of Worms Armageddon like the Olympics, in Worms we call each set of game settings 'schemes', where in Olympics there are different 'events' or 'sports'.

Personally speaking, I break down every scheme to fit 3 categories:

Artillery - These schemes are based on being skilled with weapon accuracy and consistency like Bazooka & Grenades, schemes such as BnG, Hysteria, Aerial, Forts etc.

Strategic - These schemes focus more on planning and thinking ahead, trying to outwit your opponents and doing the right thing at the right time, as well as memorizing game mechanics and adapting to ever evolving and changing situations. Elite, Intermediate, Mole Shopper, Team17 are a few classic schemes here.

Physical - These schemes focus on physical hand eye coordination skills and mastery of mechanical abilities, a player must excel in timing, speed and have great reflexes to compete at the highest levels. Popular schemes here include Roper, Big Rope Race, Time Trial Rope Race, Wall 2 Wall Shopper, Warmer.

There are many more schemes which you can learn more about here:

https://worms2d.info/Schemes

Although it's possible to create these categories of schemes in most Worms games, they truly excel in Worms Armageddon like no other Worms game. New schemes are still being invented, especially with the new features provided by 3.8+ patches, and old Classics are still being played often by new players and some like myself who have been around since 1999.

Unfortunately most gamers don't realize the incredible depth Worms Armageddon has, most people see it as a goofy casual game, which I won't deny, is part of it's charm!

It can be offputting being a noob trying to fit in being kicked from games for not knowing the rules, how to host games, however if you ask in the right places people can be very friendly and helpful and you would have an absolute blast!",2021-07-19 17:13:55,4,

comment,KomitoDnB,Worms for online multiplayer?,"Creating maps:

Here is some technical information regarding 'Colour Maps' for Worms Armageddon:

https://worms2d.info/Colour_map

What kind of maps are you thinking of creating? As most map makers are usually specific to a few types of schemes. For example i'm a dab hand at creating maps for the 'Darts' Scheme and 'BnG' since those are 2 of my favourite schemes of all time.

The best advice I can give is to understand the type of map you are making and why you are making it. Make maps for the schemes you love! A good artist paired with knowledge of the scheme they are making the map for can result in great results!

As for adding friends, if you are using Steam you can add friends via Steam ID, i'm not sure how GOG works. For those who are using CD-ROM and don't have any friends list feature, you can always use Discord to keep in touch with friends you've met, or another app.",2021-06-27 19:50:56,1,

submission,Zephyp,Which game has the best single player content?,"After not playing Worms for years I booted up WMD first time a week ago. It's a pretty good game, but as I play the SP content I can't help thinking about iconic missions from earlier games.

The thing that bothers me most about WMD are the tanks, mech and helicopters. They feel out of place and cheap. You can move all over the place quickly and shooting a tank isn't much fun. A lot of the missions are designed with using them, which makes me not want to keep playing. There are also on many missions obvious traps for enemy worms, where you just walk by and trigger a mine to kill two or three. Maybe I'll try WA or WWP instead.

Which game do you think have the best SP content? As I have most of my hours in WA and WWP, it's one of those. Can't remember them all, but I'll say WA for now. If nothing else for the brilliant Eiffel Tower mission. Maybe my memory is bad, but when playing WMD it feels like they were more creative with the missions back then. A lot of the same stuff in the WMD missions.",2021-06-11 09:59:42,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/worms/comments/nxcakn/which_game_has_the_best_single_player_content/

comment,Monk715,Which game has the best single player content?,"If they ever managed to include the WWP single player missions into WA (which is more popular over all due to still being updated) that would be perfect.

Even though I play WA mostly online. In terms of single player I really enjoyed Worms Ultimate Mayhem which has a combination of both Worms 3D and Worms 4 Mayhem single player campaigns, with the latter even having consistent storyline.

It's important to keep in mind that the gameplay of the 3D versions differs quite significantly from the classic 2d like WA, but I find it nice in its own way as well, even though I wouldn't recommend to expect something extraordinary.

Just a cute mostly single player (I don't even know if online still works for WUM) nothing too special though.",2021-06-11 14:09:01,2,

So I looked up the game itself(which my brother has). I am seeing this game for for $200 plus, and then some have also sold for $30. 

Anyone know what's going on with this? It seems sketchy, but also totally possible the way the video game market is these days. Still, the box is a super cool find!
