            "title": "Anyone here played Hogs of war? How does it compare to the efforts of the 3D Worms games?",
            "body": "it's a different game, despite both being turn-based artillery-style game in a 3D setting, for a variety of reasons. I really like Hogs of War mostly for the atmosphere and humor, which is a parody of classic world war settings (unlike Worms that just uses different themes across the setting used for matches and missions). The dub is great, although I mostly think about the local one made for my country.\n\nOne major difference that makes the game memorable for me is the campaign, which is a completely different experience than Worms: while in the Worms games you have a set of mission that you at most can decide to finish quickly or fully to get customisation rewards (in the 3D ones, trophies in Worms 3D and Forts, par times in Worms 4/Ultimate Mayhem), Hogs of War is more or an actual journey where you use rewards after every mission to rank up your 'hogs', choosing classes and seeing them improve. Different classes indeed have different weapons and as they rank up they get new and better weapons, so you need to choose well to get the all-rounder team required to beat the more complicated missions (or you can choose to focus on certain specialization if you're inclined to do so and know what you're doing). Of course, this works because throughout the campaign, you're always playing with the same team, but be wary: the game has a permadeath mechanic as well. If too if too many hogs die during a mission, some of them will die permanently and will be replaced by recruits, losing any of the ranks you assigned to your old veterans. If you are not skilled (I am not) it can make things very difficult very fast, but the satisfaction of beating the latter stages of the campaign is incredible.\n\nThere are also a lot of other differences, especially gameplay-wise, but as far as my opinion goes the campaign and atmosphere are the two major reasons why it's distinct enough from 3D Worms to stand on its own and be worth a try.\n\nOne thing: if possible, avoid the PC version. That version is incredibly broken (among other things, enemy AIs cannot move their hogs), and the digital copies available on current stores unfortunately do nothing to fix it up.",

I wont spoil it here but if you are of the generation that had a Spectrum and/or graduated to Amiga then you are in for a treat with all the cultural references.\n\nFunnily enough I had a forerunner to Worms on the Amiga called Scorched Earth which was a very silly tank artillery game with silly voices so this whole trip down memory lane of British gaming is amazing for me and probably others too.\n\nI only first discovered Worms when I was talked into co-buying a PS1 at university as an all round after the pub home arcade experience.  Never regretted it although studying often went out the window!\n\nAnyway the videos are well worth a watch and complete the package!",

A proper remaster with 4K graphics (that's the reason you cannot zoom) and maybe some new additions would have been really nice.",

It's a shame it apparently can't be somehow modified, I think a lot of players wouldn't even mind some blurrier textures if it meant you could actually see things better.

The Switch in general has issues already with some games having poor in-game text scaling andon-screen game elements being too small (including the characters you're controlling).. so naturally with an old PC game that originally had smaller resolutions, it's gonna be a recipe for some visibility issues when it's not accommodated for at all.\n\n\nTo note, playersCAN use the Switch's magnifier accessibility feature (double-tap home button once enabled in the System Settings, I believe) but that's probably not ideal, especially during active gameplay.",

            "body": "Because there is no reason it should be on PC, as the most updated version of the game is already available on Steam and GOG.\n\nIn fact, this Edition is based on an older version of the game from 2013 which does not support the numerous gameplay features and fixes from the [v3.8 update]( released in 2020, such as [extended game options]( and support for more than 50 FPS in-game. There is nothing particularly new in this release that couldn't previously be achieved with existing software / addons, and the actual new additions hardly matter in practice.\n\nOn top of that, while it is now easier to set up online games, there is no cross-platform support. This will lead to the eventual decline of the playerbase, as has been the case with every previously released modern Worms game so far (where not even Steam/GOG/Epic users could play together). Releasing it on PC in this state would be damaging to the existing Armageddon community, which is still very active and heavily connected via mods, recorded games, custom maps and other things that are either absent or would be quite problematic to support in this new Edition. And while most people could simply ignore it, it would inevitably lead to less players online, at the same time creating bad PR for the game due to the lack of meaningful updates that actually matter - such as higher-resolution sprites with zooming/scaling support as mentioned in other posts here.\n\nNow of course, it would be nice to get all the features back in sync on all platforms, via some sort of collaboration. The new UI is a good example of that. However, as of right now, this Edition is not the answer.",

I personally turn off crafting in all schemes I host because I think it's a terrible gameplay mechanic, especially if its local multiplayer and people can see what you craft.",

Is that available anywhere?  It was also way more hectic and fun with the bigger splash ranges.\n\nThanks.",

            "body": "I haven't fully figured out how this would work, but I was thinking that it would be the standard \"flat\" style Worms game, where you're only moving backwards, forwards, up and down, but from the POV of each Worm. Obviously the view of the full map would be an issue, so something like the Worms having a holographic watch (think VR Pipboy) that you look down at to make their decisions for weapon usage, calling in AirStrikes, and being able to view the map from the standard angle for attack planning would have to happen.\n\nMaybe the launch of the upcoming game will inject some life into the IP. I've been playing Worms Rumble a bunch lately trying to clean up my unfinished PlayStation Platinum trophies and it's making me want more.\n\n",

            "body": "Okay, if I do understand which game you are talking about, then the answer is mostly no: the PS3 version shares the name (partially, the PS3 game is called Worms 2: Armageddon) with the game in this trailer, but is actually a completely different game that was based on a different style of the 2D games and is substantially different from the original 1998 Armageddon. That's also why there is a 2 in the name of the PS3 one, it's technically a sequel to the simply named 'Worms' PS3 game (also called Worms HD on 360 IIRC) and the additional subtitle is just there to pay homage to the classic (or marketing points, depending on how you view it).\nWorms 2: Armageddon was then re-released on PC with yet another name, Worms Reloaded, which you may have heard about.\n\nYou can just look up a gameplay of 1998 Worms Armageddon, a gameplay of the PS3 Worms 2: Armageddon and a gameplay of Worms Reloaded to see how the PS3 game is essentially identical to Reloaded, while 1998 Armageddon is its own thing.\n\nWith all of that said... I personally think most games in this series are equally valid, and the gameplay loop variations aside is always the same solid formula, and I don't think that changes for the games I mentioned above.",

            "title": "Tell me the story of how you were first introduced to the Worms franchise? ",
            "body": "A friend of mine in high school circa 1998 had Worms 2 for PC. Our household had only gotten a PC a few months prior, so the world of PC video games to me was a total mystery for the most part. I was a lifelong gamer/addict prior to this and when he showed me Worms 2, there was something about it that hooked me INSTANTLY. I liked it so much that I started to poke around and find information where I could and saw that a sequel was coming out that upcoming summer. \n\nI bought it on launch day and it's both the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. I had a lot of fun (by \"a lot\" I mean a truly disgusting amount of hours) learning the game, making friends, having long, in-depth conversations with people all over the world. I bought WWP when it come out and bounced back and forth between WA and WWP but eventually went back to WA full-time because it was getting great updates that WWP wasn't getting. \n\nI've also bought and extensively played every Worms game since, aside from random ones on handhelds or whatever. I'm personally not a fan of the 3D Worms games. \n\nReloaded was a huge disappointment in every area except maybe aesthetics. It has severe \"console-itis\" and while it did have some cool new gameplay elements like sentries and lighting strike, et al, it just wasn't fun to play. \n\nI played a ton of Revolution and Clan Wars, mostly on Playstation but also a bit on Steam. \n\nI've been playing WMD on Steam since launch. It has its issues but overall I don't think it's terrible. That being said, WA is still the gold standard. It's an absolutely perfect game, especially with the patches over the years. \n\nWorms Rumble was straight-up trash. \n\nAnyway, I'm definitely a huge Worms fan and I hope that Team17 is working on something new. I've asked them via social media and said that there's no news to report, which doesn't mean anything. As of right now, WMD has been out for 8 years so it's definitely time for a new game. I just hope that Team17 doesn't screw it up too much. They have a really bad habit of trying to reinvent the wheel with every new game rather than keeping what is good and adding to it. Fog of war buildings? Cool. Crafting? Absolutely terrible. Also, I'd love it if they could actually get the ninja rope right because it's basically perfect in WA.",

            "body": "Interesting question, and I'd be curious to know the answer to it.\n\nFor my part, I haven't, but as someone who usually tries to complete the single player modes, you'll find most of the single player modes will usually have at least a handful of rage inducing moments and challenges you must complete. Worms 4 is probably the only single player mode I've played that wasn't obnoxiously difficult at certain points.\n\nWorms 1, 2, and 3(Armageddon) all famously had some really difficult parts in the single player modes. This usually means some impossible challenge must be completed where you have to get luck to go just right for you and/or the enemy AI is put in the perfect position to screw you every time. This is usually why I never 100% any of these games, though I usually get pretty close.\n\nThe AI is something that doesn't improve much either, and relies on ridiculous crack-shots with the bazooka and grenades and air strikes.\n\nThe story of the modes, it ranges from some degree of super serious with a side of humor, to full scale comedy. I do not think every game does this perfectly though, with some of the newer entries going full scale British humor. I know there was always British humor in the games, but some of the later games do it to an obnoxious level. But my point is the humor of the storylines is going to vary wildly from game to game.\n\nAs for general gameplay, it remains mostly the game throughout. Yes there are tweaks and modifications here and there, but the core gameplay loop never changes and many weapons remain eternal staples in the worms arsenal. \n\nWhy haven't I played every worms game?\n\nIn some cases like Worms Royale, battle royale gameplay does not appeal to me though I tried it. In some cases like worms Fort on the ps2, I didn't have a ps2 at the time, though I have the game now and a ps2 I just never came back to it. And by the time the 2010s came around, the series just didn't evolve, it felt like I had seen and done it all after playing virtually every worms game to date. So I took a break, and with the lack of couch multiplayer for friends these days much of the fun of the series was taken away because the AI remains braindead.\n\nArmageddon is obviously the most famous and it deserves it. It was a clear step up from Worms 2 in every conceivable way. WMD is fun but the story mode did not appeal to me and with a lack of friends, I just didn't get into it as I Don't like random multiple matches as online multiplayer is nowhere near as fun in virtually any game today as it was 20 years ago. I also enjoyed the 3-d games. I enjoyed worms 3-d and it's level design and it's hilarious blend of serious and comedic story telling. Worms 4 was also fun for it's create a worm, and it's over the top story telling and the worms legendary dialect.  \n\nAll that said I am curious about this new Armageddon release. But overall I think Team17 needs to innovate the series somewhere along the line, it simply seems stagnant, and honestly I think a new 3-d game would be awesome and I never understood the hate those games got. I can understand preferring 2-d to 3-d, but the 3-d games were fine in their own right.",

            "title": "Worms Armageddon Project X build by me",
            "body": "Warning: very long post regarding Worms Armageddon and powerful mod called Project X, TL:DR is at the bottom.\n\nHello fellow worms fans, today I would like to tell you about things I've been doing for the past year.  \nI'll start in the year 2012, when I stumbled upon PX forum and since then my favorite Worms game changed for the rest of my life. For those who dont know:\n\nProject X (or PX) is a modification for Worms Armageddon which provides scripters access to various parts of the core gameplay elements, such as the game logic and weapons. Existing object classes can be altered, by overriding their methods to modify their behaviour towards certain events, and new classes can be created to add extra functionalities to the game. \n\nProject X also adds DirectX 9 rendering support to the game, which grants the user with the possibility to render, rotate and scale 32-bit sprites in real-time.\n\nThis opened so many possibilities one can only imagine. During golden era of the mod, people were highly enthusiastic, forum was thriving, everyone tried to contribute by making schemes, weapons and other stuff. This led to the problem that grew exponentially. The mod uses special .pxl (Project X Library) file to implement scripting and inject it to the game engine, but since 90% of players were not familiar with any coding knowledge and mod structure, every minuscule modification was saved as a separate pxl file to avoid conflicts between libraries. Files were updating, new versions, new names, different iterations of same library with just couple lines modified, it quickly became a mess. Full libs folder with every possible scheme and lib was over 2 gigabytes (while typical lib size is no more than 1 Mb). Some libs had more than 7 versions, some schemes required particular set of libs incompatible with the rest, conflicts were unavoidable.\n\nAnother problem of the mod is that it only works on an outdated version of WA (3.6.3.1) and is close-source. The developer of the mod (Entuser) is long gone and hasnt been seen for many years, while the game was getting new patches and improvements. Combine this with very tedious and finicky mod installation process. This led to a slow but steady decaying of interest and regress in player count. This was the state I left WA and took a long break from it.\n\nAbout a year ago I decided to remind myself how fun it was with the mod. After many attempts, I got it working, this is when I stumbled upon a small group of people who were still playing quite regularly, had their own telegram chat and somewhat stable build they shared with each other via zip file. But game modes were scarce, since only a few stable schemes were available.\n\nThis whole situation inspired me to take action and do something about it. Being no coder at all and working in art field, I never had any experience besides some basic in middle school. I started analyzing all the code snippets, scripts and libraries and in few months I got a hang of it. My plan was to fully reorganize these libraries, get rid of duplicates, solve bugs, make an understandable structure and most importantly, make everything compatible with each other.\n\nRoll many sleepless nights, some math tutorials, few hundred hours of testing with trial and error method, and thousands lines of code. All this leads to today, when I'm finally ready to share my work with everyone. In the TL:DR below is the link to the Dropbox folder where I store everything.\n\nThere you can find installation guide along with the all files you might need to get it working. The fore-mentioned libs folder is now only 200Mb, well organized with prefixes in file names, while containing more libraries than was available before, there are more than 70 working schemes, hundreds of maps specifically designed for PX. In our telegram group we're all using my reorganized version for couple months already. There are still some bugs appearing from time to time which is unavoidable because I'm working alone and it's easy to overlook some dependencies and conflicts. The mod is still very tricky to get working, many factors come into play: Windows version, graphics card, screen resolution etc. But once you get it working, there's no denying you will have fun playing with it.\nSorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. Feel free to ask for telegram link if you would like to join, we play almost daily. Keep in mind that there are many Russians there, but also a few Ukrainians, we tend to keep politics aside and just enjoy our favorite game together. You can also comment here if you experience any problems with getting the mod working. Best regards, 'PX'0rang3.\n\nTL:DR:\nDropbox link to the folder with Worms Armageddon version 3.6.3.1 with Project X mod and installation guide along with fully reorganized libraries and schemes folders Ive been working on for the past year.\n",

I haven't seen any reason for people to dislike them, I actually find the gameplay a lot more comfortable with a 3D camera since the screen feels less cluttered and zoomed out, and the environments feel a lot more natural. I also just find traversing a 3D space more fun in general.\n\nI'm not actually sure what the current state of this series is, I know there was a game relatively recently (Rumble) but I never see anyone talk about it.

            "body": "From what little I know about the development of the series, making the 3D games was actually pretty challenging in terms of development (for one, they all use a custom engine that was specifically designed from the ground-up to support Worms-like terrain destruction in a 3D environment, something that was not obvious or simple to achieve back in the PS2 era). Being challenging means being more expensive, and while the games didn't do badly in terms of sales from what I understand, they also were not exceptionally successful, either.\n\nMy theory (so something I'm not saying because I know, just an opinion) is that Team17 found themselves a bit in a difficulty after Worms 4 and decided to go the safe route rather than risking wasting a lot of money on developing a new 3D title (that would probably have required changing the 3D engine substantially, if not making a new one).\n\nThat safe route ended up making 2D Worms games designed to be like the originals before Worms 3D - starting with Worms: Open Warfare for the PSP: if you notice, a lot of games up to Reloaded are essentially variations or expansions of Open Warfare.\n\nThey saw that got some success that way and decided to continue down that path. And when they felt safe enough to start making some bigger changes in terms of gameplay and visuals, they nevertheless still stuck to the 2D formula for this reason (Revolution+ClanWars first, WMD later),\n\nUnfortunate that the game that tried to get the franchise in a new direction (sans spin-off minigame-like titles) was the one that felt like it made to chase trends - and therefore having the least substance to it (Rumble and Battle Royales). I really hope the franchise isn't dead yet after that one, though at this point I'm left wondering if Team17 has even a dev team left in it and have not basically become publishers-only. The information on that and the IP's future is basically non-existent as of now... we'll just have to wait and see.\n\nTo be honest... I would just be happy to see update to the old games at this point. Release Worms 3D and the original Worms 4 on GOG, then update Ultimate Mayhem to include the last few missing bits of content, modern steam input powered controller support and a couple of bugfixes. I would just be happy with this.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nOne thing about the gameplay and comparison between 3D and 2D games: it really depends on the user you're asking. If there's something that classic Worms fans (1 to WWP, flagship Armageddon) and modern Worms fans (Open Warfare to WMD, flagship WMD or Clan Wars) can agree on, it's disliking the 3D games. And for some of their reasons to do so, at least as a point of criticism I kinda agree (as someone who generally likes the 3D games more myself).\n\nI think that's the saddest thing about the situation, really. We never got to see what the franchise could do in a 3D environment beyond the original PS2-era games, as WUM is just a remaster, and what gameplay improvements could've been put on the table thanks to new technologies that became available later on.\n\n*NDR sorry about the wall of text, I kinda went on a rant, but you know - this subject is something I've often thought about in the past few years, so I surmised I could try and expand on my thoughts here.*\n\n**TL;DR:** it's unlikely we'll see new 3D games, or even more new Worms games in general, due to T17 appearing to have left the series to rest for a while. The 3D games were hard to make and at some point they decided to stick to what they knew worked and was successful and build on that, eventually becoming a little dependent on it. As far as gameplay goes, it's up to everyone's opinion, but I have to admit that most of the fans of the series tend to like the 2D games more for various reasons.",

But Ive always wanted to play a game that mixes both 3D and 2D to get the best of both worlds.\n\nBut youre right that a problem with 3D is that there are too many places to hide in 3D, which doesnt translate to riveting gameplay. There would need to be more weapons to bunker bust or destroy terrain en masse! Or the bazooka could destroy terrain in an infinite length cylinder like it does in actuality in the 2D games, haha. I think it may not look weird with the right animation. \n\nYoud definitely have to play in both 3D and 2D, though, because in the 2D view youd get worms clipping through terrain, so youd need the 3D view for context.\n\nIt definitely adds exciting elements, though. For instance, by hitting one island, you could hit a worm on different island  But itd be easy to spot that opportunity as all worms you could hit would clip through terrain in the 2D view.\n\nHopefully I explain it well.\n\nEdit: The 3D voxels can be imprecise whereas the 2D pixels can be precise.",

            "body": "> The x axis.\n\nTHE X axis it an arbitrary reference frame decided by the game engine... and there's a really good chance neither you nor your target are on it\n\nAre you saying it should just swap to a 2d slice along the line between you and your target?\n\nseems like asking the dev team to build and debug two separate engines AND a smooth transition between them, which, there's probably a way to make it work, but it feel like a hard sell given the luke warm reception the 3d games got in the first place, which is why i think they went back to just 2d and polished that experience up a bit \n\nbut yea, it seems implausible to be able to view all enemies from a 3d map, in a 2d view as well... and some people would complain about the removal of the skill challenge of skill-shooting missiles in 3 dimensions\n\n> For instance, by hitting one island, you could hit a worm on different island  But itd be easy to spot that opportunity as all worms you could hit would clip through terrain in the 2D view.\n\nthat sounds like a nightmare for predictability... i suspect a mathematician could prove that any 2 positions in that system could be manipulated such that any third position were on the same 2d x coord as one of the original 2 worms... so it would be functionally the same as 1d worms b/c you could always make any work on the map appear very close in the 2d projection of the 3d world, then just gank them... more of a mobile puzzle game than a worms game",

            "body": "I was so excited for Worms 3D, and while I found a lot to enjoy about it, it was quickly obvious that some things just didn't translate well. Some of it was due to limitations of the tech (and perhaps, experience of the developers). Even for its time, it wasn't very good-looking. The terrain destruction was impressive in its own right, but a clear step back from the pixel-perfect blasts we were used to in 2D.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get to play Worms 4 until long after it came out. It was a massive step up, and it introduced things to the series that I hope we always have (turrets we're such a good idea).\n\nBut the improvements of 4 just made it more clear how the game can't really translate 1:1 to 3D, just conceptually. A huge element of Worms games is digging tunnels to hide from being knocked into the water, or getting hit with air strikes, or whatever else. In 3D, this doesn't work at all. There's no camera set-up that can clearly show a network of tunnels in 3D in a way that's easily readable. \n\nThe other thing is the artillery gameplay, which is kind of the whole point, right? In 2D, you can zoom out for a good view, aim as needed, try to account for all of the relevant physics factors, and take your shot. In 3D, you have to be looking up at the sky, and rely on the HUD to get a sense of your angle. This could probably be done much better now using a trail-renderer to show the start of the path or something, but I think it still wouldn't work as well. You'd be much more inclined to stick to weapons that you aim more directly at your opponents. \n\nI could go on, but I'll leave it at that.\n\nI'm a long-time fan of WA and WWP, but I think the series peaked at WMD (in spite of a few missteps). It's such a shame that game didn't kick off a new series of games in that style, and with its best ideas.",

            "body": "(Yes *Worms Rumble* came out 3 years ago, but that was more of a spin-off that didn't have the classic turn-based gameplay we all know and love)\n\nOptimistically, I think we may be due for a new *Worms* soon (or at least in the next 3ish years or so). Even more optimistically, a Team17 dev might lurk in this subreddit, or might come across this thread if they search on Google for \"Worms Game Wishlist Reddit\" or something, you never know. With this in mind, what do you hope to see in the next worms game?\n\nHere's my list personally:\n\n* **Bring back Rope Racing**. One of the most dissapointing things to me about *W.M.D* was is that Rope Racing practically didn't exist besides kinda existing in like 1-2 story missions (at least on Switch and Xbox where I played the most). Let me play Rope Racing locally and online using maybe around 12ish pre-made maps, along with maps from... \n\n* **In-Game Map Editor, With In-Game Community Hub to Share/Download Maps**. I know the PC version of *W.M.D* had a map editor, and the Steam Workshop is cool, but imagine if there was a in-game community hub akin to *Mario Maker* or *Levelhead* that allowed you upload and download custom maps and gamemodes across the Xbox/PlayStation/Steam/Switch communities. Team17 could even use some of the most popular and highest rated custom maps/gamemodes to feature in online play. Of course, this feature unlocks it's fullest potential with...\n\n\n* **Cross-Platform Play**. Granted, this one is more or less expected considering *Worms Rumble* had it, but it's still worth mentioning since a mainline *Worms* game hasn't had it yet. \n\n* **Increased Crate Limit**. I liked *W.M.D* so I don't want to sound like I'm just shitting on it lol, but another disappointing thing about *W.M.D* to me was that it never felt like there was that many crates on screen even if you set everything to max, which kinda nerfed the chaos a little bit. I tried re-creating \"Crazy Crates\" from *Worms Reloaded* in *W.M.D* with terrible results. Let me have my fun.\n\n\nWhat else would you like to see?",

Worms Open Warfare art was like, the peak for the series, they just looked so fun and expressive.\n\nGameplay-wise, getting the physics as close as possible to Armageddon would really be my main thing. I want worms bouncing, sliding, etc all over the place. I also wouldn't mind crafting making a return, THAT is a feature I didn't think I'd like as much as I did.\n\nVehicles, ehhh I could go with or without. If they stay, I think they need to be changed severely. The drillboat in particular makes it really easy for people to just chill in the water at the bottom of the map tanking damage (if they're not straight-up hiding underground)",

Idiotic tacked on ideas (survival games have crafting now, why not worms?, games have battle royale now, why not worms?). \n\nDeep customization, people want worms games they can make uniquely theirs.  I like your ideas about map creation, allow the weapons to be customized as well.  Inexcusable that as new worms games were released, they had less and less customizability.\n\nRecycle the old physics engine, because somehow they got worse over the years, WMD being one of the very worst.  \n\nSupport for larger maps like WA has.  Its 2024, no reason why a procedurally generated map generator cant handle more than a standard sized map.",

            "body": "Hi folks, \n\nI played Worms + Worms Armageddon a lot as a kid and was looking to add some Worms sound clips into my Twitch Stream. I was surprised to see there was actually quite a lot of resources for documenting and finding everything the Worms say in these first couple of games and I've managed to find a good chunk of the ones I want.\n\nHowever, there is one specific voice clip which I am almost certain I heard regularly in these games but I cannot find any evidence of it's existence anywhere! I've listened to Youtube videos of all Worms voice FX, read the Worms Wiki and been sent files of all the files ripped from the original Worms game on PS1 and can't find it at all.\n\nThe voice clip in question is one of the Worms saying **\"Now you've done it!\"**, which I assume would be after they've been hit and damaged in some way. Does anyone else even remember them saying this, and if so do you know anywhere I can find the voice clip for it? It's driving me mad as I was so sure it was what I was hearing but now I feel like I've imagined it! As far as I remember, the Worm didn't have any accent or anything, it was just the default standard 'Worms' voice.\n\nThe last Worms game I played was Worms 3D and I only played it very briefly so I doubt it's from that game. I'm almost certain it'll be from Worms (PS1) or less likely it'll be on Worms Armageddon (PC), but if not then I'm out of ideas.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated, thanks!",

I'm not experienced at modding games at all, and I'll be busy for most of the year seeing as I'm doing a final year project for my master's in computer science degree (not trying to show off, just think this might be a relevant field), but it does sound like something I'd be interested in maybe trying to fix as part of my winter break.",

            "body": "Mainly two things:\n\n- Weapons and balance. Worms 3D has a different weapon set compared to other 3D games, with some weapons being specific to this game among the 3D family (like the Red Bull, Sticky Bomb, Petrol Bomb, Nuclear Test). Additionally there are other gameplay differences. Just to list a few: destruction works a bit differently, maps tend to have less land and drowning is more common, explosions and how worms are thrown away by them also work differently in my opinion, oil barrels generate flames like most 2D games instead of poison clouds. This is the main reason why the campaign present in Worms Ultimate Mayhem is very different than the original in Worms 3D, despite featuring the same maps and mission objectives.\n\n- Maps and customisation. The PC version of Worms Ultimate Mayhem has most of the Worms 3D maps available as multiplayer ones, but not all of them. Some of the secret and less standard Worms 3D maps are still missing and thus remain exclusive to the original game. Additionally there are some differences in customisation, with speech banks present only in this game and certain scheme options not being retained in the sequels.",

As I can recall, there are National themes like the US anthem, France and the UK as well as Israel. There are so other themed ones like a silly elementary school sounding tune and I believe alien themes as well. \nIve seen the main theme, and the various level themes on YouTube but not the short jingles. \n\nIf anyone can please point me in the direction? Thanks I want to see if can make ringtones out of them",

But its only available for version 3.6.1 and very finicky to install and get it to work.

            "body": "#Explanation:\nFirst off I think it's important for me to say that somebody else might have already done this, and if that's true, I don't claim credit for being the first person. I did this on my own while thinking about forts maps and building some of my own, and if this isn't a new idea then I am sorry. There also might be some serious problems with the balancing or even just the map shape that I'm not aware of because I am not a Worms Armageddon expert like so many others are. For all I know this will break quickly in testing.\n\nNow, moving on, I'll explain how this concept works and what's different.\n\nYou still spawn on one fort in your map, and you still can't go into the enemy fort. You start in your own fort no matter what.\n\nThe difference is that terrain in the middle. You *can't* spawn there, but you can go there. It is surprisingly viable to paracute in from the top of your own fort when the wind is right, and that is what you are encouraged to do. I don't know if ninja rope experts can also do it with ninja ropes or not.\n\nThis allows you to advance a bit further, and collect crates. Note that dead tree in the middle. It's meant to be another obstacle in the worm's way toward getting to the other side of the crate drops, that the other team will want to pick up before you do. You would probably have to ban shotguns to make this gamemode work. Or even add several more obstacle dead trees. Or upheave the map design a bit.\n\nMaybe this isn't in the spirit of forts, but that wasn't exactly my objective. I wanted to create a new twist on something familiar in Worms gameplay.\n\nThat's it, that's the concept.",

There may be something on that front for Armageddon with some mods, but I am not confident that is the case (I'm sure someone will pipe up to correct me if that is not the case, but Armageddon mods tend to cover gameplay and technical functionality, not quality of life features like this one).",

            "body": "UPDATE: This also works with Worms 4: Mayhem.\n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, I've finally figured out a way to make the FMVs work on current versions of Windows, and without having to press Alt+Tab every time one starts playing. It's a bit of a hassle, so here's a little tutorial.\n\n\\_\n\nFirst, you'll need to download \"Windowed Borderless Gaming\". I'll be referring to it as \"WBG\" for short.\n\nExtract the downloaded \".zip\" file and then start both WBG and Worms 3D, respectively.\n\nWhen you get to the game's main menu, press Alt+Tab on your keyboard. If Windows' taskbar doesn't show up, try pressing Win+Tab as well.\n\nAfter doing that, click on WBG's icon located in the system tray and select \"Add window ( F3 )\", then go back into the game and press \"F3\" on your keyboard. (You can press it more than once, if you're unsure it worked.)\n\nExit the game, click on WBG's icon once again, and go into \"Settings\" -> \"Game settings\" to check if Worms 3D's executable was detected. If it wasn't, please repeat the previous steps.\n\nWhile still on the \"Game settings\" tab, type in the same resolution being used to run Worms 3D and then increase it's width value by one (1).\n\nExample:  Worms 3D - 1280x960 / WBG - 1281x960\n\n(You can try increasing the height value instead, but I feel that it doesn't work quite as well.)\n\nClick on \"Apply\", then click on \"Ok\" to close the tab.\n\n\\_\n\nNow, at long last, start the game once again and all of the FMVs should be displaying correctly. If it still doesn't work for some reason, try pressing \"F4\" to re-apply your WBG settings while in game.\n\nHope this helps!",

The last one had a few very needed features but it also bugged the inventory, which no longer shows weapon descriptions and just has an empty UI box occupying space on the screen with no text that is not necessary or game breaking but is still incredibly annoying.\n\nWMD is one of my favourite games of the franchise and it really didn't that much to reach a great state in terms of its features. It didn't need to get supported for a decade like Armageddon does, just parity with previous games in terms of basic features and squishing all remaining bugs. It does really feel like a missed opportunity.\n\nI don't mind Rumble, I just hoped it featured an arena mode comparable to Duck Game in order to be viable as a party game long term, too. When I understood that wasn't the case, the game ceased to be interesting beyond some matches with the beta back then just to see what the gameplay was like. Online-only is a big nono for me regardless of the player count.",

These two are highly connected in worms series, because the mode sets your possibilities, suhc as ammo, health and the amount of crates that could be used both as a weapons resource and also be used as fuel tanks.  \nMore powerful weapons mixed with big amounts of time may require much less skill to be required.  \nI also don't agree that other modes give less room for tactics and creativity. In fact, jetpacks, dynamites and other powerful tools are the exact thing that deprive the meta off any deeper strategical and tactical thought.  \n\n\nAnyway, still props to you and your opponent for that gameplay cause while not the highest, it definitely was good.",

It sounds somewhat interesting... the part about [Real Time Worms]( is interesting too, because when Team17 tried it with Worms Rumble it was poorly received. The game has plans for more customization than ever, and [Editors]( has a part about \"over-customization\" (that sounds a bit like the problem LittleBigPlanet 3 and Dreams had for me where they started to seem too complicated for me to get into the creative modes of those games), and [Weapons]( mentions problems that could arise from \"awful, unbalanced weapons that people would surely create in extreme numbers\".  \n\n\nIt sounds like it could be an interesting read for me. I've already read the Real Time Worms page which mentioned Liero, which was not the first time I've heard of the latter game, I first knew about its existence due to a YouTube comment.",

            "title": "Do you think that all the schemes that will ever be super popular have been made already in Worms Armageddon?",
            "body": ">Its interesting how long existing schemes gain and lose in popularity. I wonder if competition events come up because of the popularity of a scheme or do they actually make the scheme popular. Because how schemes become popular appears rather arbitrary to me.\n\nYep, that's the next step along to think about here. My gut feeling is that it's both, or either.\n\nWith schemes that are suitable for, and as a result pick up steam in, actual top level competition, starting a league or CWT/EAC-style event focused on them is probably the more important aspect, and the thing that keeps interest in them going long term. But in order to know which scheme to pick for that purpose in the first place, someone somewhere will have needed to notice its potential for it, and that would have come from seeing it played at a high level. So in this case, probably both.\n\nFor schemes that seemingly have little interest in positioning themselves as seriously competitive, it's a little more vague and random, down to sheer luck in some part, with no real need for support in any organised competition save for perhaps the Worm Olympics or a TUS cup to get the word out initially. Examples of this I'd mention would be things like BnA (Bow & Arrows) and later Mine Madness, which are just this crazy, fun concept that arrived at the right time (more than 8 randomly spawned mines and huge maps becoming possible in an update) and took WormNet by storm for a few years, but then fell out of fashion somewhat, replaced by the next fun fad. Like the Supersheeper that someone mentioned in a reply here, which became absolutely huge especially among Russian-speaking players and Twitch streamers. But then also turned out not to have as much staying power as something like Intermediate or Kaos, each supported by their respective competitive frameworks in ONL/CWT and Dream's Kaos League.\n\nBut then you have an in-between case like Hysteria as well, whose initial fans not only didn't see it as anything other than a fun free-for-all passtime for larger groups of friends, we actively campaigned against seeing it turned into a tryhard competitive 1v1 affair. But precisely that ended up happening anyway, because enough league players wanted to see it happen and so the scheme became one of the most played TUS staples of all time. And so these days, if I were launching an all-around league of my own, I'd be including Hyst for sure!\n\nI suppose the point I'm making is, it's complicated because it's more a sociology problem than one of objectively measurable, raw scheme settings. And while our community isn't huge, it is large enough for it to exhibit the characteristics of a complex system, in the sense that for example world weather does; meaning that making sense of it is unintuitive and very difficult to predict in the medium and long term.",

            "body": "Just recently got Worms WMD and already knew that you could make custom maps, so I created a map for me and my friends to play consisting of random memes and stuff, then uploaded my map and it worked. Unfortunately I realized that in game the map was floating above the water just by a bit, so I went back to the editor to update it and it wouldn't work. I then tried deleting the original workshop item so that I could reupload it as a new map, which also is not working. When I try to upload a map, it simply says \"Failed to update content on Steam Workshop.\" Steam is saying that Worms is failing to sync with the cloud but whenever the game or editor is open it says it that is synced, and every time I try to manually sync it, it fails. I have no clue what I could be doing wrong and there are pretty much no resources out there I could find that can help save for one Steam discussion that basically says \"reinstall steam\" which means reinstalling every other game I have and heck no I am **not** doing that. I'm at a loss because it worked and now suddenly it won't. I have tried restarting Steam too and that does practically nothing at all. Any ideas for what a newbie like me could be messing up here? At the moment I'm stumped.  \n\n\nEDIT: RESTARTED MY COMPUTER AND SUDDENLY WORMS DECIDED TO SYNC LMAO",

            "body": "I used to play WA and WWP quite avidly years back, but the fact that WA has been continually developed has kind of eluded me all these years. I know that WWP feature integration is planned further down the line, but what about W2? I've just watched a single player playthrough (not all of it obviously, since it was over 5h), and I've noticed that W2 seemingly had some worthwhile stuff that it'd be nice to see ported into WA. Probably has been discussed to death too. So could someone knowledgeable let me know which of the following has already been made available in WA?   \n\n\n\\- Colored water - I've only seen the usual blue water in WA and WWP, was a bit surprised that W2 had several water colors going, making it a bit more abstract.  \n\\- The W2 worm death animation - it was actually kinda charming! I know porting the gravestone itself was probably trivial, but the death anim?   \n\\- The music - I've noticed it's quite different from what I was used to in WA and WWP, are there considerations to add it to the shuffle list? It'd definitely mix things up a little.  \n\n\nHuh, that's all there is apparently! Of course I'm aware that there were also two weapons in W2 that didn't carry over to WA and WWP, but I think the Homing Cluster Bomb and Homing Airstrike are derivative, redundant and unbalanced, so no one probably even wants them back. And the 1P missions are basic, uncreative and repetitive, unlike in WA and WWP, so I'm not even asking about those.",

            "body": "When i look up Worms3D download on google, the first 2 links i get from 'MyAbandonware' and 'oldgamesdownload' are both safe and functional downloads. I have done both of them.\n\nThough it requires from 30minutes up to 2 hours of fiddling, depending on your experience with 'mounting' of ISO files, since the files you download are ISO files, which need to be manually 'mounted' as CD files on your computer in order for them to function just like the original CD. The exact instructions are on both the pages on the websites themselves, below the download button.\n\nI noticed the 'oldgamesdownload' (the second link) is a little easier on the instructions. But the deeper instructions on the 'mounting' i think is in a useful link on the first website, with that, you'll get the mount fixed up. Unless you're not patient at all, since i see most people comment it doesn't work. But i see that's just because they screw up the mounting process. I did it in 1 hour.\n\nJust know that the mouse controls are inverted up&down and there are no key binding settings on pc. Very strange. I enjoy it purely for the nostalgia, but for the gameplay experience (w/ full mouse control and key binding settings); just download Worms ultimate mayhem on Steam.\n\nOne tip on the mounting, once you are halfway through the instructions and you do the right click on the file to click the 'mount' option and it isn't there, you need to right click the folder file > Open with... > Choose new method > click the original Windows way as standard, which is; File explorer. Sometimes people have a different explorer thing as standard, which removes the mount option. If it doesn't work, you'll have to look up \"no mount option on (xyz) windows\" and you'll get your instructions.\n\nBe patient with the mounting. Doing it in the correct steps slowly makes it way smoother.",

            "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nBefore starting I will just leave a little disclaimer that, despite not being entirely related to worms, I am taking some reference from the 2D games of the franchise and I found no more appropriate places to ask this question.\n\nI am an aspiring game developer wanting to do something like Worms, a passion project, let us put it that way. Ever since I was little, I fell in love with the worms franchise. I found the games extremely fun and, recently, have regained interest in it. In fact, I just bought armaggedon, since it is on sale on steam! \n\nAnyways, I have made a previous post comparing the 2D and 3D versions of the franchise. Everybody gave me a lot of insight in the games that are of their interest. A lot of people also commented about the movement in the 2D games feeling way more fluid, especially thanks to roping. Ropes are a tool I never found out useful when I was little, and so I was baffled with this information.\n\nI am trying to make this game on Roblox. While I wanted to do something like worms and I tried asking what you, worms players, like, I found a pretty big roadblock regarding the mentioned roping. The engine allow for ropes, however said ropes are not collideable and so would clip through the objects. I have, however, completed my random map generator and let's say I am proud of myself on that regard.\n\nThis time, instead of asking in the franchise alone, I would like to know what you all think makes a game in this genre good. Examples such as Scorched Earth, as far as my research goes, has a lot of appreciation but it is certainly nothing like Worms! \nThank you so much for reading and I hope to see you in the comments.",

            "title": "Can someone explain key differences/compare W.M.D, Armageddon, Reloaded, Revolution, and Ultimate Mayhem? Except for obvious things like being 2D or 3D",
            "body": "I for myself use rather personalized generation system when categorizing the Worms games. It goes like this.\n\n+ 1st Gen: Worms, Worms: Director's Cut\n\n+ 2nd Gen: Worms 2, Worms Armageddon, Worms World Party\n\n+ 3rd Gen: Worms 3D, Worms Forts: Under Siege, Worms 4 Mayhem\n\n+ 4th Gen: Worms Open Warfare series, Worms XBLA series, Reloaded (+ Worms 2: Armageddon on mobile)\n\n+ 5th Gen: Worms Revolution, Worms Clan Wars, Worms Battlegrounds (also Worms 3 on mobile)\n\n+ 6th Gen: Worms WMD, Worms 4 on mobile\n\nRemakes and re-releases belong in the gen they were originally released in. Now, to the differences and key traits of each generation:\n\n+ 1st Gen: Very basic Worms, with a handful of notable differences. For example, a worm's turn doesn't end if he takes damage.\n\n+ 2nd Gen: The \"classic\" Worms era. Ninja Ropes and a (perhaps unnecessarily) high variety of moderately-balanced weapons dominate the battlefield. No weapon is particularly tricky: Their differences come in things like damage, accuracy and knockback. Utilities also mostly just let the player get from point A to point B, with only a handful of exceptions such as Girders and Freeze. And even they are very simple to understand. Once in a blue moon, you might come across a ridiculously powerful and equally bizarre weapon, such as the Martyn Brown Bomb.\n\n+ 3rd Gen: Transitioning to 3D also gave us a cut in weapons that were deemed unnecessary by Team17. This is where Armageddon's huge arsenal shows: weapons such as the Handgun, the Bow, and Dragon Ball were all cut seemingly because they were so very very similar to existing weapons. To compensate for the loss of weapons, Mayhem introduced Armageddon-esque super weapons such as Alien Abduction, Bubble Trouble and Bovine Blitz. These are more defensive than the ones we saw in Armageddon, likely to help newer players more. The different gameplay in Forts also tackled the issue of less-limited movement in 3D landscape while Ultimate decided to embrace the more \"brainless\" side of Worms that doesn't require so much aiming and artillery skills. (Which is why Worms 3D can be considered the better game of the two, ignoring the spin-offy Forts.)\n\n+ 4th Gen: Returning to 2D, Team17 didn't want to just repeat what they did in Armageddon. Taking advantage of the more powerful hardware (and also their experience), they developed interesting new tools and weapons that behave like things never seen before, such as the Electromagnet and the Lightning Strike. There are also other more sophisticated tools for strategy, such as Worship, Boomerang and Steal. Some of these tools never came back after being introduced here.\n\n+ 5th Gen: Perhaps the most unique 2D Worms generation, this is the first and so far the only place we have seen Worms classes. The main games in this generation also feature dynamic physics and water that open up hundreds of new possibilities. New weapons are introduced to fully take advantage of the dynamic water system, and Clan Wars also sees a couple of 4th gen esque tools such as the Lucky Charm that improves weapon efficiency while slowly generating health and Oxygen that makes Worms immune to suffocating and toxic gases. Oh, and you can also use coins to buy weapons, if you don't like being given random weapons from crates. No, this isn't an EA game: You get the coins from in-game coin crates *available equally for everyone*. \n\n+ 6th Gen: Axing the classes (which were apparently difficult to balance?) and dynamic physics (which wouldn't have fit the new art style?), WMD tries to once again go with the more sophisticated touch with its vehicles and buildings. Replacing the coin system we have weapon crafting, which takes into account that you shouldn't be able to use the same resources to get yourself a Cluster Bomb and a Concrete Donkey. Without classes, the gameplay tends to focus more on player choice instead of the situation itself. In 5th Gen, you'd often have your turn dictated by the class you're playing as while in WMD, you can do whatever you like. This does reduce the weight of the choices you make when placing your worms, which isn't entirely a positive thing.\n\nConclusion: Mayhem is to 3D what Brawl is to Melee. If you enjoy more casual gameplay, absolutely go for it, because then the former is simply superior. But if you like more sophisticated weapons such as the Uzi (and the Ninja Rope not having a ridiculously powerful ability that removes most of the strategy when allowed by the scheme) and choosing where your Worms spawn via Teleport In, Worms 3D is easily the better choice. In comparison to 2D games, Mayhem is often sort of like playing on a map that doesn't limit your mobility at all, which is usually just a flat island, though the game does come with a handful of maps clearly intended for more skillful play.\n\nWhen it comes to 2D, the \"big names\" are the ones you mentioned: Armageddon, WMD, Reloaded and Revolution (or Clan Wars; they're almost the exact same game). Your preference comes down to what you want to see in your Worms game: Armageddon has the most weapons, but their uniqueness and balance can be questioned. Ninja Rope is ridiculously powerful in that game and if not limited enough it can render the strategy down to \"rope your way to the worm and shoot him\", which is pretty similar to Mayhem's Grappling Hook tactics. If you want the differences in weapons to be more meaningful, you might want to go for Reloaded. There's still some weapons missing, but their balance has been improved. And the new weapons are an absolute blast, both metaphorically and literally.\n\nRevolution and Clan Wars have the unique physics going for them, even if you don't like the class system. Many do enjoy coming up with a greater strategy with their choices of worms, though. Splashing around with dynamic water and trying to find ways to use the elements in your advantage still feels fresh to this day. But if that's simply too much for you, go for WMD: its vehicles and buildings don't exactly change the game all that much. It also has the classic rope physics, if that's a deal breaker for you, though the bigger maps help make it more balanced than what it was in Armageddon.\n\nTLDR: Using Armageddon as the base experience, Reloaded is the one with a small arsenal of unique and balanced weapons without any other gameplay enhancements, Revolution has classes and dynamic objects while still retaining Reloaded's approach to weapons to a certain degree, and WMD is somewhere between the two in its gimmicks. Mayhem is widely a more casual experience than the rest due to its map pool, though some of them do offer meaningful competition with the right scheme.",

            "body": "I've played Worms games for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories is being like 5 and jamming the Worms Xbox live arcade game. Worms 2: Armageddon is the most nostalgic game of all time to me. I pre-ordered every new game like a true consoomer just because it's worms up until W.M.D.\n\nThen by some miracle a Series X graced my possession a couple weeks ago, then a week after that I grabbed the Fully Loaded physical disc of Worms Rumble. If I'm being honest, seeing the case on the shelf was the first I'd heard about this game. It was buzzy.\n\nMy internet maxes out at like 8Mbps, so it takes like 2 hours to install the game lmao, but once it does I load up the game and play the tutorial. \"Holy shit, a side-scroller battle royale? that's kind of a great idea. Wow, the way they've reinvented the weapons mechanics is great, this game is gonna be so much fun!\" were the thoughts mostly going through my head playing it. I was enthralled. This was gonna be the best Worms game ever made.\n\nAnd then I tried to find a match.\n\nAn hour passed.\n\nTwo hours passed.\n\n278 further minutes passed.\n\n\"Bruh, wtf?\" I turned the game off, did a bit of research. The Series X version of this game came out of June in this year?!?!?!?! Is it really this dead already? Is it my internet? \n\nThis game is just fuckin buzzy bro.",

            "body": "Rumble at least didn't seem like a cash grab on initial glance, in my eyes at the least. The annoying thing about game development is there's a need to innovate to stop things turning stale and to stop sales falling off. Rumble seemed like a test of changing the gameplay like the 3D games, except instead of changing the dimensions in play, they changed up a core aspect to make it more action-oriented. It turns out this being tied to a big multiplayer scheme thing was a *bold* attempt at changing the formula, but the usual gamble of \"servers are ghost towns after a while\" coming up empty again is less a surprise as it is an inevitability.\n\nThough I have the feeling that telling you this isn't gonna change much cause you're willing to write off WMD as a cash-grab too, the game that so closely resembled Armageddon and was actually quite decent to play, even if it adopted many of the weird foibles of the series with better scaling graphics.",

            "body": "Good afternoon to all the beautiful descendants of the beloved Boggy B!\n\nThis Saturday we have a spectacular event planned in the world of competitive Worms Armageddon!\n\n###80hp Cup | Grand Final | Dario Vs. Mablak | Saturday 25th September @ 8pm GMT Live @ \n\nFor context, Dario, Mablak and chuvash are widely regarded by the competitive community as the top 3 competitive players in the Intermediate scheme of all time.\n\nA while back, Dario created a variant of 'Intermediate' called '80hp' which is a more aggresive and creative variant which promotes a faster pace of gameplay and quicker/shorter matches.\n\nIf you enjoy watching highly skilled players compete, you won't want to miss it!\n\nA brief description of 80hp by Dario:\n\n**Rules & Highlights:**\nBetter played in bo3 or more games. 8 worms. Each round you can choose only one type of special/team weapon to use:  pigeons (x2), sheep launcher (x1), aqua-sheep (x1), holy hand grenade (x1), flamethrower (x1), cows (x2) or old woman (x1). Moles do not count as special weapon. In different rounds you can use different special weapons. If in one round you use more than one type of special weapon, you lose the round.\n\n**80 hitpoints:**\nIt makes round shorter, also makes it more rewarding to pile/reposition enemy worms with weapons that cause less than 50 damage. Raises the relevance of BnG skills above the \"why didn't I just rope and shotgun?\" level. Turns holy hand grenade and flamethrower into reliable killers.\n\n**Balanced team weapons:**\nAll team weapons are available, but you are only allowed to use one kind in each round. Moles are considered a regular weapon, not a team weapon, you have 3 of them and their power is 5. Cows and HHG have a delay of 3 turns, pigeons a delay of two, and flamethrower, old woman, sheep launcher and supersheep a delay of 0. Supersheep is also now an aqua sheep. Old Woman and Sheep Launcher power is 4.\n\n**Dyna/sheep with 1 turn delay:**\nReduces a bit the effect of first turn piles. Makes Old Woman or Sheep Launcher a decent choice if you really need to blast that first-turn pile, at the expense of having used your team weapon in the first turn.\n\n**Nuke SD (25hp/turn) at 10 minutes with high water rise:**\nReduces the impact of who gets the first sudden death turn and opens a new branch of tactical thinking, now water rise can be used more often as a killer. Also makes rounds a lot shorter. Turns of less than 1 second still reduce the time left until SD.\n\n**4 ropes:**\nBalances the fact that 80 hitpoints makes it easier to kill worms, increases the relevance of BnG skills and encourages the use of long range team weapons (pigeons, super sheep, holy hand grenade).\n\n**2 shotguns:**\nForces players to look for more creative ways to cause 50 damage if 50 damage is really needed.\n\n**35s turn time with 10 seconds hot-seat:**\nmakes rounds more dynamic, but it also gives more strategic players the time they need to plan ahead.\n\n**Rope roll-drops:**\nEnables using weapons with the enter key between rope swings or after detaching from bungee. This includes weapons that you can normally use while roping and also the ones usable while jumping. This opens a whole new set of possibilities where the action happens between rope swings, it may be particularly interesting for dropping animals. It also means that long bungee flights are useful now, since you can open the parachute at any point during the flight to avoid losing control of your worm.",

            "body": "Big post, worth it though:\n\nOther than a break between 2019-2020, I've been playing Worms Armageddon actively online since 1999 with tens of thousands of hours played in various schemes and leagues.\n\nGenerally speaking, most dedicated players will agree Worms Armageddon is the best in the franchise other than those who have only played the most recent releases.\n\nWorms Armageddon has more customization than any other title, it's perfect for extremely competitive players just as much as casual players. The sheer magnitude of customization we have with Worms Armageddon is actually magnificent and is enough to last a lifetime really, i've been playing actively myself since 1999.\n\nYou can play both single player & multiplayer both offline & online, as well as single player training, missions and deathmatch.\n\nThe physics of Worms Armageddon is peak Worms for most people, due to the specific game engine that gives Worms Armageddon a vast depth that other games lack.\n\nFrom being able to create your own custom maps and share them with the community, to full control over custom scheme settings even down to individual seconds and power/ammo/delay settings and much more! Not to mention the amazing wormkit modules that enhance gameplay for everyone making it even better:\n\n\n\nWant to hear something else amazing? Worms Armageddon is still, after 22 years being maintained and updated! The latest big release being last year with 3.8 and 3.8.1:\n\n3.8 - \n\n3.8.1 - \n\nHere is one of the best websites to discover and learn just how much depth this game has:\n\n\n\nThere is also a handy hosting service called HostingBuddy, which is an automated hosting server for people who cannot or will not host manually. You simply type !host scheme name here and HostingBuddy will host a game for you, you can read up on HostingBuddy here:\n\n\n\nThere is also WormNAT2 - A WormKit module which enables players behind NAT or firewalls to host games which are joinable by everyone. It achieves this by hosting games on a proxy server, which redirects connections to your computer.\n\nYou can read more about hosting here:\n\n\n\nThere are also active leagues and competitions throughout the year:\n\nThe Ultimate Site -  - The main public and active League in the community.\n\nOpen Normal League -  The most prestegious League which focuses on the Intermediate scheme where the best Intermediate players play.\n\nCrespo's Worms Tournament -  - The most prestegious once a year event for Intermediate which happens once a year, only the best of the best compete.\n\nThink of Worms Armageddon like the Olympics, in Worms we call each set of game settings 'schemes', where in Olympics there are different 'events' or 'sports'.\n\nPersonally speaking, I break down every scheme to fit 3 categories:\n\nArtillery - These schemes are based on being skilled with weapon accuracy and consistency like Bazooka & Grenades, schemes such as BnG, Hysteria, Aerial, Forts etc.\n\nStrategic - These schemes focus more on planning and thinking ahead, trying to outwit your opponents and doing the right thing at the right time, as well as memorizing game mechanics and adapting to ever evolving and changing situations. Elite, Intermediate, Mole Shopper, Team17 are a few classic schemes here.\n\nPhysical - These schemes focus on physical hand eye coordination skills and mastery of mechanical abilities, a player must excel in timing, speed and have great reflexes to compete at the highest levels. Popular schemes here include Roper, Big Rope Race, Time Trial Rope Race, Wall 2 Wall Shopper, Warmer.\n\nThere are many more schemes which you can learn more about here:\n\n\n\nAlthough it's possible to create these categories of schemes in most Worms games, they truly excel in Worms Armageddon like no other Worms game. New schemes are still being invented, especially with the new features provided by 3.8+ patches, and old Classics are still being played often by new players and some like myself who have been around since 1999.\n\nUnfortunately most gamers don't realize the incredible depth Worms Armageddon has, most people see it as a goofy casual game, which I won't deny, is part of it's charm!\n\nI myself have been hosting little Tournaments with small cash prizes and streaming them live on Twitch this year, here is a video for one of them:\n\n\n\nIt can be offputting being a noob trying to fit in being kicked from games for not knowing the rules, how to host games, however if you ask in the right places people can be very friendly and helpful and you would have an absolute blast!",

            "body": "I don't mind at all sharing this information, most people won't bother searching already existing information, though every time I paste it, there are little changes, it's a work in progress.\n\nI guess i'm looking at what the OP asked differently as well, i'm reading it as \"most played currently\" rather than \"most active at present\". Meaning I was looking at it like which game has been played more to this current day. Though I won't deny there was some subjective bias behind reading it that way lol.\n\nI'm also looking at the future too, I believe Worms Armageddon will most likely last longer than W.M.D though, unfortunately due to the lack of care and attention from Team17 from experienced developers improving the game like how we have Deadcode and CyberShadow updating and maintaining Worms Armageddon. So as activity drops in W.M.D, it will remain in Worms Armageddon, although I could be wrong of course.\n\nW.M.D has amazing potential and I wish it could see the same love and care that Worms Armageddon has seen... I've also had a few W.M.D players come into my stream talking about how buggy W.M.D is, especially the Ninja Rope.\n\nPersonally speaking I think W.M.D looks beautiful and has a few interesting features. It has the potential to have as much freedom and content as Worms Armageddon, though it feels like it has a mere fraction of the content and customization available in Worms Armageddon, and that's another perspective of \"most played\" I feel like Worms Armageddon wins on as there is more to it to be played.\n\nEDIT - Actually something I haven't mentioned, i've got both WA and W.M.D and i'd say it's actually worth buying them both when they are on sale, they are both great games, of course it's obvious which I prefer lol, there's a few well known players who play both as well.\n\nSo yeah, from now on i'm going to encourage buying both since they are incredibly cheap when on sale.",

There are a few game-breaking bugs where you can use multiple weapons in one turn, and desyncs seem to be more prevalent there. If you want to get serious in ranked play, these can be a sore spot as there are lots of people glitching. I've informed Team17 of these bugs multiple times and they've never released a fix. I don't expect they ever will.\n\nHowever, the game looks much better than WA, and buildings and vehicles are a fun twist on the game for more casual play. So if you're with a group of friends who are playing for laughs, WMD is the better game. But if you're looking to depend on the online community to play custom schemes and be more active, WA is actually the better option.",

            "body": "WMD does not have the larger player base, wow...\n\nGenerally speaking, Worms Armageddon is the best in the franchise and most dedicated players will agree other than those who have only played the most recent releases. \n\nWorms Armageddon has more customization than any other title, it's perfect for extremely competitive players just as much as casual players. \n\nThe sheer magnitude of customization we have with Worms Armageddon is actually magnificent and is enough to last a lifetime really, i've been playing actively myself since 1999. \n\nFrom being able to create your own custom maps and share them with the community, to full control over custom scheme settings even down to individual seconds and power/ammo/delay settings and much more! Not to mention the amazing wormkit modules that enhance gameplay for everyone making it even better:\n\n\n\nWant to hear something else amazing? Worms Armageddon is still, after 22 years being maintained and updated! The latest big release being last year with 3.8 and 3.8.1:\n\n3.8 - \n\n3.8.1 - \n\nHere is one of the best websites to discover and learn just how much depth this game has:\n\n\n\nThere are also active leagues and competitions throughout the year.\n\nCurrently TUS is seeing a healthy amount of activity right now and we are almost only 2 months away from CWT 2021 - The most prestegious Tournament in the game which happens once a year, only the best of the best play!\n\nI myself have been hosting little Tournaments with small cash prizes and streaming them live on Twitch in the past 1-2 months, here is a video for one of them:\n\n\n\nWorms WMD is alright, the comparison between WMD and WA though, i'll let you decide for yourself :)",

            "body": "If they ever managed to include the WWP single player missions into WA (which is more popular over all due to still being updated) that would be perfect.\n\nEven though I play WA mostly online. In terms of single player I really enjoyed Worms Ultimate Mayhem which has a combination of both Worms 3D and Worms 4 Mayhem single player campaigns, with the latter even having consistent storyline.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that the gameplay of the 3D versions differs quite significantly from the classic 2d like WA, but I find it nice in its own way as well, even though I wouldn't recommend to expect something extraordinary.\n\nJust a cute mostly single player (I don't even know if online still works for WUM) nothing too special though.",

I just found the original box for it and since I have started selling things online, I decided to list it. Wow! that thing goes for some big money! At least one of them did. \n\nSo I looked up the game itself(which my brother has). I am seeing this game for for $200 plus, and then some have also sold for $30. \n\nAnyone know what's going on with this? It seems sketchy, but also totally possible the way the video game market is these days. Still, the box is a super cool find! \n\n",
