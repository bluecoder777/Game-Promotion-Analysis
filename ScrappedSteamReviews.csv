Mass Transportation

Snakeybus is an arcade driving game developed by Stovetop LLC. As the name might suggest, this is a bus-centric take on the classic snake, and yes, it’s as wacky as it sounds. On one of eleven different maps, your goal will be to pick up passengers and take them to a destination. When you drop off passengers, your bus gets longer, letting you pick up more passengers but eventually making it harder to navigate the maps.

I found this game decently enjoyable. I wanted to play it to get all of the achievements, but after I was done doing that, I lost all interest in playing it. It’s a fun concept but it gets stale pretty quickly.

Positives:











Snakeybus is a great concept and it’s fun for a little bit, but it gets stale rather quickly. I’d say it’s worth grabbing for a couple of bucks, but I wouldn't pay more than that.

This game saved my life.

I am 36.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",Recommended,126,0

I saw this game at the front page being on sale, and since I'm passionate about buses myself and like playing Snake, I decided to give it a try. The result is... Snek Epicness. This takes Snake and bus driving on a whole new level, the passengers screaming while being vacuumed into the bus adds bonus comedy points. It has lots of features, including multiplayer which appeared recently, buses, maps, game modes, you name it. So, while this game is on sale, I definitely recommend you to play, it's overpriced a bit though, 5 bucks would be enough.",Recommended,46,0

The game is an artistic statement on capitalism's guaranteed demise. The bus, which is the state of technology, continually moves forward and the path behind inevitably blocks further development. The passengers, which represent the consumers, climb in at the forefront of technology and depart only when they have reached the destination someone else chose. They'll stay on as long as technology continues to move, and are all dumped in the same spot: dissatisfaction.

Also, bus go vroom so that is a plus",Recommended,46,0

I love snakey bus. it isn't a love that could be put into words, this game is not something that is now a fundamental part of me. I had friends once. I would play games with them, but when snakey bus came and they refused to buy it, snakey bus became my only friend. I am snakey bus, I am nothing without snakey bus. It is a part of my mind body and soul. If I stop playing it I will be nothing. This is not a addiction, it is a religion. All hail our reptilian public transport overlords, and when my devotion finally pays off and i die, i hope to see not but a long bus.

It is also very fun and relaxing, 10/10",Recommended,36,0

This is one of the greatest games I played - it's quick hit.

1. Relaxing to Chill Hop
2. Speeding thru town like Crazy Taxi to pick up pedestrians
3. Hearing the faded screams of the people
4. Landing out of bounds to see all the people you picked up burning and screaming as they blow up out of your bus.

Repeat

Something about this is just soo damn fulfilling.
The unpolished areas just make this game 10x more hilarious and not serious.
This is the relaxing yet fast paced game I needed and it's just hilariously incomplete (in a good way).

Great little game

* on playing some more, there are things i feel are missing.
Whilst it is nice that its a smooth drive around, with some nice trip hop music playing. there are no real big sound effects. whilst you crash a lot in this, due to smashing into signs, or glass etc, there are no sounds that go with it.
i think [personally], the game would feel more crazier [& better] if there were sound effects that fitted with the setting. id love to hear screams of the passengers, smashing of things & a real sense of this world being destroyed by this ever expanding length of a bus. the music is fine, but having this sense of total destruction would be a more fitting thing.
Also, for macOS at least. Controller support is probably 30/70. directions work fine for the bus, but any other controls are not working [at least at this moment in time]. i will post an issue regarding this.
other than these comments, its still a fun game & worth the price, but does have little things that need to be worked on further for a better experience.",Recommended,25,0

Probably the best of the under-$3 games I've bought, Snakeybus is so bizarre but at the same time really fun to play. Controlling the buses themselves is easy, and getting the hang of mapping in your head where your bus trail is in relation to where you are in the game world to avoid crashes is pretty simple. The first three worlds are more conducive to massive buses of 500+ carriages, while the later ones are tricky with tight streets or bizarre layouts like the modernist museum.

Visuals are great for such a cheap game, and the soundtrack is mostly good. Controls are pretty straightforward although ""aiming"" the bus while it's airborne can be a bit of a pain. Note there is an in-cab view, but if you suffer from vertigo using it will mean you spend lots of time alternately screaming and puking. Folks using older computers, expect some lag as your bus grows beyond 300 segments.

For you achievement hunters, my game bugged upon launch and granted two thirds of the achievements at once...but I'd say you're looking at about an hour to unlock everything barring the Paris Night level which requires luck, good aim, and maybe a video guide.

Easy recommend when this goes on for 75% off. Regular price is somewhat steep though, as apart from climbing the scoreboards for each level there's little replayability here.",Recommended,18,0

I Want To Walk To Work In A Snakeybus

For me, 'simple with great execution' trumps 'ambitious with poor execution' every time. That every review and preview starts to blur into one amorphous mass is a testament to how true this really is for Snakeybus. You can only reiterate 'Crazy Taxi meets Snake' in so many ways.

Here's my stab at it. Taking control of an articulated bus you deliver passengers to destinations - so far so normal. The twists in the tale are, one, that the bus doesn't ever stop (thankfully passengers can embark/disembark in an ethereal manner, lest you be driving a bus in name only!) and, most importantly, two, passengers delivered add sections that extend your bus. Snake was always genius, but there's something about its translation to 3D space here that feels yet more so.

Watching hundreds of bus sections trundling behind you occupy every free space in the map is a sight to behold and one for which few games can compare. Eventually, your minimap, which marks your extended presence on the map becomes an incomprehensible mess of squiggles, or worse, an outline of the entire map. Every movement needs to be purposeful, lest you get halted in your tracks or make an ill-judged turn into an abyss - game over. It's all wonderful mind game stuff. You can use time-limited rocket boosters to create openings for yourself to drive under or play the more desperate moment to moment game of panic-cutting across gaps or jumping over yourself. Like the finest score attack games of its kind (e.g. Devil Daggers), finding and breaking the upper limit of your time intact is compulsive.

Snakeybus doles out its levels according to the number of level plays (making you give each level its due) and starts off strong with a 'squint and it has a real photorealistic quality,' squashed depiction of Pa-ree. True to its claims, its later levels aren't just visual variation with its 80s Miami, striking cylindrical abstraction, etc, but generate markedly different forms of play too. Paris's cramped roads and hazardous river give way to winding platforms and perhaps worse, open areas and complete freedom. The bus select screen eschews menus for a physical bus swerving around a corner and taking out whatever live, dynamic traffic is there at that time. And the music, the MUSIC - the lo-fi study beats that have become such an internet sensation are a masterstroke here.

It helps the control is pitch perfect. Not content with oversimplifying, Snakeybus gives you the ability to drift, to accelerate, and as mentioned, to rocket-propelled jump which gets cut off for a significant time after depletion. It controls like a dream on a keyboard or now controller. A first-person perspective can be toggled to, but I wouldn't recommend the handicap! Just another dose of fun in a bottle of it.

As with any score attack game and repeat plays, the interesting part comes later into the level when you've got to the length wherein you're impeding yourself. A genre issue, perhaps, that you have to go through the motions on each replay to get to that moment or your personal best. Maybe some kind of toggle-on rewind mechanic is the answer to this? That would compromise the leaderboard purity the game achieves, however. All in all, it's a short space of time to complain about, but it did come to mind.

With its inspired design and surprising spectacle, it's my favourite kind of game. One that's focused on delivering unique gameplay you couldn't get anywhere in the triple-A space, but not disposable and delivered with the polish and execution regardless. I just can't wait to see how updates proceed for this one. The potential is through the roof. It's cheap (but anything but cheap); it's brilliant; it's Snakeybus.",Recommended,18,0

It's Snake in 3D. No, I promise it's very entertaining!


Gameplay

So there's not much to really say. It's snake in 3D, but you drive an infinitely-extending accordion bus. You have a jump button to help with the 3D, you unlock more bus types, you unlock more levels. It takes a while to understand the mechanics, but once you understand the mechanics, you start trying to get the highest records of Steam and ask yourself How the hell did people get 900 bus length?

The soundtrack, at first I didn't like it. I felt the game could have used more... upbeat adrenaline-rushing music, but after playing the game for an hour, it started to sink in: You're not driving a car at extremely fast speeds, it's just a bus around a closed-off map. Just take your time, and carefully tread around the map.




During my playthrough, I... never really paid attention to the framerate. I didn't notice any drops, so I can say I was always higher than 60fps with my i9 9820X, 64GB of Ram, 2x 1080Tis in SLI (Did not check if SLI was actually working). The game was installed on an SSHD where each level took ~7 seconds to load. Quick to load, quick to start playing, and I like that for a small game like this.",Recommended,18,0

Snakeybus is a 3D snake game with some pretty cool maps and casual gameplay. Whole thing is very easy and relaxing, unless you are really trying to go for that high score each time. For me, it's the experience that matters. And I have to say, I had more fun with it than I anticipated. The people at the bus stations are the usual apples/dots that you take in as the snake, and as expected of a 3D snake game, you have a jetpack/jump function that allows you to move over obstacles, including the rest of the lengthy train/body.

The price is a little high at base for $9.99 US, but since it's on 75% discount right now, it's well worth it. The achievements were all very easy to get except for getting to 420 train carts and also getting one of the maps, which I had to follow specific instructions for. Otherwise, they just unlock as you play on. For me, it was right around 1.5 hours for 100%. I did not play the multiplayer version of the game, which is fine. You do not need to play MP to get the achievements. It allows you to take some pretty cool pictures as well, if you decide to do so when you have built up a pretty awesome looking train.

Example here:


It's pretty fun, so grab it on sale and enjoy it for what it is--a really nice take on the simple game of snake with nice graphics and a 3D environment.

I only played with a controller. Needed to click on Single Player after launch with the mouse first, after that, the joystick was used for Menu navigation and also gameplay. You will be able to accelerate/decelerate in addition to jumping and just moving/turning.

Nice visually designed maps, each rather unique and gives a different feel from the others.

Very casual and relaxing, accompanies the game well.

Casual players looking for a very casual experience.

As above, base price a bit high, sale price is well worth it.

This game is a literal masterpiece, one of the best I've played. Language can't begin to describe why it's so good, but I'll make a feeble attempt here. On the surface, it's simple enough: bus but snake; once you step behind the wheel however, you'll see that the game's appeal extends far beyond what's found at the surface. It can be a very relaxing game as you lazily go from stop to stop, performing an essential function necessary to any healthy public transportation system. It can also be fast-paced, deep, and riveting, as you drive a bus on a row of buses, dodging and weaving among your past jumps and abusing absurd twists to launch yourself to the heavens in the quest for leaderboard glory.

This game has many lessons to teach, on logistic growth, on ecological collapse, on non-newtonian physics and space-filling curves; but most of all it reaches into the soul and probes the deeper questions of human experience: Why are we here? Why do we keep up this fruitless search for unending growth in the face of inevitable death? I can't answer these questions, but after playing this game I find I no longer need to.

I'm utterly perplexed by the few negative reviews with the gall to complain about a lack of content or poor value for money. I find it very telling that the current 'most helpful' review that complains about 'being bored after a few hours' comes from an account that has now played it for nearly 20. Speaking of which, this game would be a bargain at $20, not to speak of the $10 it currently costs. I can't imagine what motivates these deranged individuals to spread lies; perhaps a financial incentive from car manufacturers is to blame. Nevertheless, I rest assured that the mere presence of Snakeybus in their libraries will one day emancipate them from their psychotic state and restore them to normal functioning.",Recommended,13,0

This is not merely a game. It is an experience. At first you will play it like any other variation of snake, but then you realize you can go down the same street 2 or 3 times side-by-side with your own trail, the ghost of bussing past. And then you realize you can jump. And by this point, the entire street network has been consumed by the bus. The West has fallen. Billions must bus. The diorama of a normal cityscape has fallen apart. Cars lay on their roofs, pedestrians have all gone home, the only people left alive are those saved from your wrath by the comfort of their home, and those waiting at the bus stops to enter Mr Bones' Wild Ride: Public Transportation Edition. At this point, you begin driving on top of your trail, and the main street begins stacking. The main road, already consumed entirely by 3-4 different bus trails, now rises like a building under construction to 2, then 3 levels. Your bus defines an era. There is BC, there is AD, and then there is AB (After Bus). And then, as suddenly as it began, it ends, because you missed a jump and fell into the river. You fool. You moron. You goober.

Overall I give this game a 10/10 but be sure to change the settings because it defaults to a 30FPS cap. I can recommend this game for everyone: hardcore gamers, casuals, children, the elderly, toddlers, fetuses, the souls of the damned, you name it. Everyone can enjoy an Abnormally Long Bus in equal measure. It's a fun little 30 minute distraction, but looking at the leaderboard there are apparently people who have managed to play the game without crashing into themselves (or the river) for almost an hour. Replay value is also really solid; just like snake, you learn, you get better, and eventually your bus will consume all known space in the universe.",Recommended,15,0

Dear Stovetop LLC,

This game is very good, but personally there are some changes that I would make.

First of all, the city maps need to be bigger. I am well aware that it's supposed to be challenging when you get to the 300-400 segment range, but those city maps feel like you are smushed. I'd say make them a little bit bigger.

FYI to all the people looking to buy this game, Coriolis is the best map. Period.
(Especially if you want to get the 'Blaze It' achievement.)

This part isn't necessarily a gripe about the game itself, but its a gripe of my heartache. Before writing this, I was on the Coriolis map trying to get the 'Blaze It' achievement. This achievement requires 420 segments, and I died at 418 segments trying to drop off my people.

The soundtrack is very well done, and if it was added as a DLC, I would probably buy it. And I never usually buy soundtrack DLCs.

Overall very very VERY good game, and is very well made for multiplayer. If you have the money for this game, I highly suggest trying it out.

It doesn't have too many active players, but if you have a friend or two it's a pretty fun mini-game. Otherwise, the singleplayer (with a High scoreboard) is still fun. There are a few different maps and modes, and you can unlock buses and achievements.

I heard about it from Writing on Games, and I had to give it a shot. It’s a fun and unique game, that takes the old concept of Snake that everyone has played at some time and revitalized it by adding a third dimension and the concept of public transportation.

Really you’ve seen most of the game already by watching me play. You get passengers you drop them off, there’s a lot of different level designs and unique bus designs, but at the end of the day, it’s Snakeybus

I don’t think there needs to be much more to the concept and you can pick it up for a couple of bucks and enjoy it for hours.

This seems like a fairly simple game on the surface, blending a first-person bus-driving simulation with classic Snake gameplay. You drive your bus around, sucking up screaming passengers and dropping them off at various destinations, weaving through increasingly tight spaces until you crash or run out of room to keep moving. It's all fairly ridiculous.

Beneath this deceptively silly veneer, however, the game speaks to the soul-crushing plight of the modern worker. You are compelled to keep driving forward in the endless quest for productivity, your very survival at stake, your mission growing more futile and insurmountable with each passing moment, the burden of responsibility weighing heavier, all remaining paths to success shrinking into nothingness, until the pace is no longer even remotely sustainable and it all comes crashing down in a massive avalanche of liability lawsuits, hospital bills, and death.

I do have a few issues though, namely I would like more maps, for both singleplayer and multiplayer, but this is still the most fun you can have on steam with $10.",Recommended,5,0

Many bus! This game is very silly and fun and it's exactly what it's advertised as. Singleplayer mode has a lot of different gamemodes and maps but multiplayer could use some work given the fact that it only offers one gamemode and ONE MAP (Fun at first, but playing the same map over and over, back to back.. no) Come on devs; how long would it have taken you to add more multiplayer maps?? The multiplayer release seems very rushed and not well thought out which is sad because the few rounds I did play I was laughing my ass off! I recommend this game if not for the multiplayer, then for the singleplayer which I am currently still enjoying.",Recommended,5,0

Ridiculous 3D Snake As A Bus
You're a crazy busdriver with heavy feet so you cannot stop. You can accelerate and decelerate, but not stop. Drive over passengers waiting at the bus stop to scream and fly into your bus. Deliver them to the specified bus stop. By doing so your bus lengthens with extra bus wagons behind your first bus proportional to the amount of passengers you delivered. You get ludicrously many bus wagons behind you, making you a very long bus train like a giant snake in a city filling the streets with its tail. You're not dead if you run into your own tail as in the original game ""Snake"" on old mobile phones, but you can fall off ledges and are game over if your movement is blocked by your tail for a few seconds. You can jump, jetpack fly and Rocket League like roll and tilt through the air to avoid your own tail. This gets crazy funny, but loses it's appeal soon, although there are some bus customization unlocks and new levels. I got all 17 achievements of this game in almost 1 hour. I guess this says something about the game. Though, I really like the concept/idea and it's very well done! But the single player won't hold you for very long if you're not into super try hard highscore chasing.

What make even more fun and hold you for longer is the multiplayer of the game. But the community is pretty dead, so you gotta bring your own friends for that bigger fun.

I liked it how it is, though. Good ridiculous fun for one session.",Recommended,5,0

It's the classic game Snake, except in 3D and you're a bus. Try to grow as long as possible without getting stuck!

There's a nice variety of maps, from cityscape to toy-sized to abstract. You get a limited recharging jump rocket to bounce over obstacles or your bus line.

Single player is fun but doesn't have much replay value. I tested multiplayer briefly and it appears to work, gonna try to rope some friends into buying next time it's cheap.

Snakeybus, a game no one thought they needed until they tried it out. A humble friend of mine heard about this game through some steam recommendations, and decided to notify me about it. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. Jokes aside, the game has potential and for a price this low on sale, pick it up and support the developers. One complaint is that i felt heat radiating from my computer and upon checking temperatures my GPU was sitting at ~80 C, and was using 95% of my GPU's power, so although it ran smoothly, it needs some fixing in terms of the power it uses.

I absolutely love Snake, and I have loved it ever since I was a child. I've been sad for many years because I have not found a good remake of snake yet, but more importantly, no one has done anything with the concept either -- until now. Snakeybus really takes what I love from the original Snake and makes it even better. I love the they expanded on the concept and have done something with it.

In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#41 out of 500+)... it's time for Snakeybus.

Snakeybus is the gritty, modern, 3D re-imagining of the classc 1976 arcade game, Snake. And it is thoroughly brilliant. Best $3 I've ever spent. Only flaws are a lack of environments to play around in and too little differentiation in bus types--neither of which is a big deal.

Couple of negatives.
Controller support, while there, is clunky. Remapping is a pain and doesnt seem to work properly.
Picking a bus only works per level start, as in every time you start a game you have to go select what bus you want again.

Diary: Snakeybus

Day 1 - 1/23/2020
It's 1 AM, I should be sleeping, but I saw a snake game but with buses and had to play it for a bit. I selected the first level, which was a dorm, and started to collect people until I became so big that I screwed up and couldn't move anymore because I crashed into a corner badly.

This game feels like a far more lenient version of snake, which makes me appreciate the game all the more, it allows me to get further and have a much bigger transport unit as a result. Long live the busses.


Day 2 - 1/23/2020
Well, now that It's middle of the day, I guess ill play the game, instead of you know 1 AM. Going into the game, I like how nice the graphics look for what it is. It's pretty decent, and there is plenty of alternative transports you could use once you earn enough points. You also unlock a bunch of levels that have their nice themes. Being able to use the sky cam to hover over your transport creation nightmare train is pretty fun too. I wouldn't say to my friends to get this full price, it's better to wait for a sale, but man is it just an overall fun little game if you're a fan of the snake genre.",Recommended,3,0

You will enjoy playing it a couple of hours. It is a great time-killer. But I would honestly recommend you to buy it when it has a reduced price (for example 5€ instead of 8€).

A good game putting a great concept into practice with decent art design and relaxing music.
After completing the achievement of reaching 420 fragments, I felt the game was celebrating the urban-planner's efficient use of space: as long as you follow a well-designed route (which is what you're supposed to do as a bus driver), you will be totally fine.

In London, it sometimes costs £10 or more to take the bus.
I just paid £6 to crash a Snakeybus around Paris.

10/10 would recommend!

Take it for what it is: It's an arcade style crazy-taxi but with a bendybus. Boris Johnson would be proud. Apart from missing a DLC where you can get stuck on a zipwire flying two Union Jacks, it seems to have enough to keep you interested for an hour or two. This isn't a game to play for hours and hours but its really entertaining.

Paris and Miami make you plan and navigate tight streets and time your jumps just right, while some of the other levels are just plain out of this world - I'm talking rainbow road-esque but with more motion sickness!

Controller support isn't ready just yet, but I played with WASD and had a lot of fun. It's cheap, Devs seem chuffed to bits and I love the art. When controller becomes available I'll definitely use it to pass the time!

All Snake, No Meat, No Venom

As far as 2D to 3D transitions go, Snakeybus is not at all a bad attempt; in fact it's done so well it could best be described as a direct ""dimensional port"".

Here, you may notice why I'm not recommending this game; with the above, coupled with the price tag you must ask yourself: ""Do I want to pay $10USD for a 3D snake clone?"" A game mind you, that would pass easily as a free mobile game and perhaps even better as a free Flash game back in the day.

Let me acknowledge though, if this game were marked as ""early access"" or even simply as an alpha or a demo I wouldn't have a problem; knowing this is bare bones for a reason and that there is a glimmer of more content on the horizon I might happily have paid for this experience. However it doesn't appear that there are any signs of further content or perhaps even gameplay changes. The game appears to be and will maintain being a 3D snake clone for $10USD and if that alone is enough for you, each to their own; however I disagree given that there's much better games available on steam for either the same price or even cheaper.



Snakeybus charges the player with taking control of a high speed bus that cannot slow down (stop me if you've heard this one) and consequently must deliver as many passengers as possible without stopping; all the while having more carriages added on, resulting in fewer space to maneuver, that requires pre-planning to successfully stay moving.

The game offers a total of 6 small individual levels, each of which can be played through in roughly 5-10 minutes. The level design is done quite well. You can tell the dev(s) designed the levels around one single idea and built the level around it; so as a result you are offered 6 different stages, each with their own aesthetic and strategies. You unlock each stage with a very unconventional method, whereby you must play the previous level(s) a minimum of 5 times for an unspecified amount of time/progress.

The game features a 'credit' system whereby you are rewarded an unspecified amount of credits per level and can spend them on 5 different bus skins; one of which is a reskin of the default model and each being cosmetic only. The skins can all be collected in a span of roughly 40 minutes.

The added ""twist"" to Snakeybus because of its transition to 3D (allowing for verticality to become apart of the equation) is a jump feature, allowing the player to jump between ~40second intervals.

Those with a keen eye and possibly even a creative mind may have noticed very large gaps that can be easily filled and expand the gameplay beyond 90minutes and also that the game is very vague and provides little feedback/reward; however it remains a mystery why these problems have not been addressed. The game is very bare bones. There is no overarching challenge. Rarely any tension. No real progression or attainable goals to keep you playing. Again, if that's your cup of tea (which for most who bought this game it seems to be) than buy this, if not; look elsewhere.

Here's a few things the dev(s) could add or look towards implementing:















I hope the dev(s) consider these changes/additions. Right now the game just feels lazy, like this was a weekend project shortly abandoned so they just stuck a $10USD price tag on it and shipped it. I get the whole 'minimalism' angle but there's a fine line between simplistic design and anorexic-like content. Right now, the game is just $10 bucks for a 3D snake that you could find on an apps store for much cheaper; or better yet, spend that $10 on a game that'll keep you occupied for well over 90 minutes in short sittings.",Not Recommended,20,4

My little brother talked me into playing it, looked a little goofy, but what the hell. Probably the best $15 spent on any short game.

Never played a game with this style of coordination, it was incredibly fun to learn. $15 was well worth the 6 hours of fun, dying from laughter, figuring out puzzles, and the time spent with my brother.

My wife and I are hugely into local co-op games, but we almost bounced off this one. We failed so many times that the first level took us well over an hour. We wondered if maybe it was just too difficult for us, and we've finished some truly challenging games together.

We took a small break, came back to give it one more try and... the second level was challenging, but totally doable and we finished in a much more reasonable time. By the end of the game, we even went back and replayed the first level, and while it was certainly easier for having gained a lot of practice, but it was still insanely hard for a first level. The level order seems completely random to me, and seems to have nothing to do with creating any kind of difficulty curve.

The game is plagued with inconsistent, and often seemingly insurmountable, difficulty spikes... but... it was a lot of fun. If you like co-op games that require a combination of skill and efficient communication, this is definitely for you. Play it with a loved one and you'll both be belly laughing over all your stupid mistakes... when you're not teetering closer and closer to passive aggressively blaming each other for everything that goes wrong. If you can clear the first level, I think you can make it all the way, but it will never be a 'walk' in the park.",Recommended,51,0

Biped is one of the best co-op games to be released in a long time, and a strong contender for my co-op game-of-the-year for 2020!

Even though the base mechanics of the game are fairly simple, each level modifies them in interesting and amusing ways. It tests your ability to work together to progress through really fun challenges.

Each of the main story levels took us about 20-30 minutes to complete, and all total it took around 4 hours to finish them all up. After that, each level has 2 additional ""Pro Levels"", which have very tough challenges based on the mechanics from the corresponding story mission.

The levels and mechanics were varied enough to always feel fresh and this game was easily worth the price. I'm already looking forward to Biped 2!",Recommended,54,2

«Review(En):»
This is not a puzzle, but a magnificent arcade game with cute biped robots. You move the legs of the robot one step at a time, climb up platforms and complete tasks. You move the legs of the robot with the mouse buttons or sticks of the gamepad.
If you play together, the difficulty increases, but the game becomes more fun, unpredictable and exciting.
You need a mouse and a controller or a pair of controllers for a local co-op. The keyboard is not used in the game.
The devs recommend playing with a gamepad (the game says so in the splash intro screen), but to playing is much more convenient and easier if you use a mouse.
You cannot use two mice in the game. The game will ask you to connect the controller as an addition to the mouse, even if having two mice connected. The only way to play with two mice is in an online co-op!
When you play together online co-op, the progress of coins, stars and open levels is saved only at the host! This is what the developer intended (the second player helps the host in his progress).
+ Excellent co-op mode for two players (online and local with on common screen without split screen).
+ There is a single mode.
+ Cute robots.
+ Beautiful graphics.
+ Great music and sounds.
+ High-quality mechanics, physics, design and gameplay.
+ The game is suitable for adults and children.
- No support Remote Play Together.

Это не головоломка, а великолепная аркада с милыми двуногими роботами. Мы по очереди передвигаем ноги робота, чтобы преодолеть препятствия, карабкаться по платформам и выполнять задания. Ноги робота двигаем кнопками мышки или стиками геймпада.
Если играете вдвоем, то сложность увеличивается, но игра становится более веселой, непредсказуемой и увлекательной.
Для локального кооператива вам понадобится мышь и контроллер или пара контроллеров. Клавиатура в игре не используется. Хоть в игре пишут, что предпочтительнее играть на геймпаде, но на мышке играть гораздо удобнее и проще. Жаль, но использовать две мышки в игре нельзя. Игра попросит вас подключить контроллер в качестве дополнения к мышке, даже если будет подключено две. Единственный способ играть с двумя мышками - это в онлайн-кооперативе!
В онлайн-кооперативе прогресс монет, звезд и открытых уровней сохраняется только у хоста! Так задумано разработчиком (второй игрок помогает хозяину в его прогрессе).
+ Великолепный кооперативный режим для двоих (онлайн и локальный с общим экраном без разделения).
+ Есть одиночное прохождение.
+ Симпатичные роботы.
+ Красивая графика.
+ Отличная музыка и звуки.
+ Качественная механика, физика, дизайн и геймплей.
+ Игра подходит взрослым и детям.

Biped is the most fun I've had in a co-op game in a while. To me, it is a satisfying blend of mechanics, puzzles, graphics, and overall enjoyment.

The controls are simple. Just the two mouse buttons or the two analog sticks on controller. The real spice are the puzzles that you face. Each level you pass introduces a new mechanic that adds a twist to how you play. I got to say that playing this game blind and seeing all the new mechanics slowly unfold filled me with a surprising amount of joy. Now, sprinkle some lively and cute graphics and you've an attractive puzzle wonderland.

A co-op game wouldn't be a co-op game without chaos and Biped provides a lot of that chaotic energy. (Given that you are playing with the appropriate person.) Hit up a friend and enjoy as chaos ensues.

What's not to love about this game? It's the prefect blend of straightforward mechanics, challenging yet enjoyable puzzles, eye-catching graphics and tons of chaotic fun.

We're strong together

Pros Cons
✔️ Great character design. ❌ Short playtime (took us three hours to complete).
✔️ Fun puzzles and mechanics. ❌ Waterlevel.
✔️ Successful co-op elements. ❌ Collision detection feels weird sometimes.
✔️ Neat and innovative controls. ❌ Stereotype worlds you see everywhere (Ice, desert, jungle etc.).

Who doesn't fondly remember the days when the Internet wasn't as omnipresent as it is today and we met up with friends to play video games sitting on the couch, whether against each other or in co-op mode. You know - live and in color. Some manufacturers like Nintendo continue to hold this local-multiplayer flag high, but commonly today, people play mostly online with each other, and the face-to-face, social component is falling away.

The story in Biped is told quite quickly. You play the two humanoid robots Sila and Aku. The tin pals are sent to Earth to light beacons that will allow them to teleport across the planet. To complete this task, they have to travel to different locations and overcome obstacles. Among other things, you'll move through the ruins of ancient civilizations in the shape of the two robo-friends, roam through desert regions and slide over icy mountains to get to your destination. In the process, Sila and Aku are dependent on the help of other robots and, of course, on each other. Only together can the obstacles be crossed - well, at least if you go off together with a friend. Biped also has a solo mode, in which you can live through the story campaign alone. The eight levels, including the tutorial, are then adapted to one person and you'll encounter more other robots, who will take over the tasks that would otherwise take up your partner. The solo campaign, like the co-op campaign, is also played through after three hours at the latest.



Biped is only played with the mouse or the two analog sticks of a controller - we played with the gamepad. The whole control system is thus reduced to a minimum, but there are still a large number of actions that can be performed. The two legs of our robot are each controlled with one of the two sticks, and different movements lead to different results. This requires practice, but after a while you get used to the unusual concept and can perform precise actions and movements. The sticks are also used when activating switches, holding onto ropes and walls, and grabbing objects. To do this, you just have to hold the stick, and thus the leg, to certain objects. With each mission, new mechanics and obstacles are presented, matching the setting. For example, in order to get to the top of a snowy mountain, we'll have to swing up ropes, use air locks to catapult ourselves upwards, and hang on magnetic walls to avoid falling down. In another area, we have to help the robot inhabitants with sawing and transport the finished wood along conveyor belts. Each level offers new, innovative puzzles and tasks that guarantee a lot of variety and fun and most importantly: It's absolutely kids / family friendly.

Cooperation is also important when it comes to swinging from one platform to another. The collision detection irritated us a few times, though, and also caused moments of frustration. The small robots can slide over flat levels, which allows them to progress faster. However, it was not always obvious where these accessible levels begin and end, but it's also a bit due to the camera, which causes problems every now and then. As a result, we sometimes got stuck on edges or were thrown over the target.




Biped surprised me quite a bit, because rarely have I laughed so hard during a co-op title. This is ultimately due to the interesting game concept, because in the game you and your partner each embody a robot, whose individual legs you have to control separately. What necessarily follows are rather chaotic and whimsical moments, which always arise when you dare to tackle one of the many fairly designed challenges. At the same time, Biped is intuitive, excellently done by the game design and manages to build up a pleasant learning and motivation curve. You're also offered a solo mode, but it's clear that the game focuses on the co-op aspect, and in this respect it shines. The stages serve common platform stereotypes that have been around for decades: Ice World, Desert World, Jungle World, etc. With coins found in the levels you can buy some headgear for the little robots - but I've seen that in funnier or more motivating ways elsewhere. Unfortunately, the very short gameplay time gets in the way. You can play through Biped with your game partner in one evening, but after 3-4 hours, depending on how well you do, all the fun is over. However, if you're looking for a decent co-op title, you can still get it, especially since Biped isn't too expensive at 12,49€ (I would highly recommend waiting for a sale).",Recommended,37,0

As of this review I've played for about 3 hours. My compy specs are: i5-4460 3.2ghz, 16gb RAM, GeForce GTX 980, Win 10. I've experienced no crashes and one bug where I was stuck in a loadscreen while my coop partner had already loaded into the game, a quick restart and it worked the 2nd time.

I feel really bad giving this game a bad review but, this game is really really short. My friend and I beat it in under 3 hours with about an hour of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around in there. It has a whopping EIGHT levels with 2 additional variants of each level. I'm telling you, you'll feel like you just started the game and it's all over. The gameplay is outstanding and the coop puzzling mechanics are well done but, they only serve to drive home how short the game is. If you have money to blow or don't care about value $/hour then this is an excellent game with great coop mechanics, please remember this game isn't just $14 because you need 2 copies tho ( the game now supports remote play). The short time I was playing it I had an absolute blast and we were falling out of our chairs laughing at points but, I can get that with many different coop games that will give me far more then 3 hours of content (at a better rate than $9/hour too).",Not Recommended,257,16

Biped is a fun, cute co-op and solo game. I mention co-op first because it's really designed around playing with another person. However, you can still enjoy solo play. The controls are very innovative and novel. The first place I ever came across using dual sticks to control separate motion was from a tank arcade game back in the 1990s. The control is a bit confusing at first, but then becomes very intuitive rapidly.


The only critical critiques I have about this game, are:

1. The camera

2. Only co-op host seems to get stars that both players got playing together.

For the first critique, if you ever played Super Mario 64 you know that camera makes a world of difference. In Biped, sometimes the camera is just right, other times it is completely unbearable. Sometimes it cuts off speech bubbles or useful areas, while other times you don't even think about it.

The second item is a personal frustration. My friend and I have separately gotten all of the stars in the solo game. However, when we played coop together we noticed that he would get 4/4 when I would only get 3/4. We haven't figured out why this is happening if it is suppose to happen. Worse yet, it doesn't seem that many, if any, are attached to my account for the achievement. This means we would have to play through ALL of the co-op levels together again (all the regular AND pro ones) with ME as host. That seems rather odd and I would guess that it's not intended? But it is immensely frustrating. I'm not sure if there's any way for the devs to fix this?


Other than those 2 issues, Biped has been a really fun, simple, cute co-op game.



2020-07-08 Update - We noticed some serious issues of the game lagging out when we would hit difficult parts. I'm not sure how they coordinated the network for co-op but it was frustrating at times to have lag kill us.

A third issue that I neglected to mention is that only the HOST can see the status of completion for each level (time, deaths, stars), which lends itself to possibly explaining why only the host gets full credit for stars.

WHAT was strange, was when I was hosting, part of the levels were completed and unlocked and it seemed somewhat random. We really didn't enjoy the boat level. It was interesting and novel, but super annoying. That's just our preference. What was nice was that those were all completed on my side, making me wonder if the devs deliberately wanted co-op gamers to replay the non-sucky levels? Or maybe there's just a sync issue with level completion stats.


If you're just looking for a cutesy co-op game, Biped is a good game for you.

However, if you care about completion, and fully polished games, I would give Biped a TEPID rating.

SUMMARY: Good solid start on a game. Needs more polish.",Recommended,22,1

I can’t really join the euphoric chorus in a lot of reviews here. Sure, it’s an alright local coop game all in all, but a long way from a masterpiece in my opinion, mostly because of the tedious movement system (you control each foot separately, hell if your controller got mechanical issues) and the sudden difficulty spikes in between. Sometimes levels were easy and fun, other levels were simply frustrating or annoying (already the first one), especially if you try to collect all the stars (good advice: DON’T, because you need the ones from the bonus levels for any achievement as well). I wouldn’t even call it a puzzle game, as coordination and agility challenges based around those leg movements and the according physics are predominant. The main story also is rather short, only 8 levels including the tutorial, and has rather few variations (mostly the standard, like river, ice, forest etc.). Instead, after finishing, the game offers several bonus challenge levels as mentioned which really are extremely hard, and this is no joke, they’re truly diabolical. To be honest, we gave up after a few tries, yeah, that’s how much fun they were. By the way, I also finished it in single player, which is surprisingly much easier and features a bit different level designs, but of course is short, too. And before I forget, there are indeed slight customization possibilities by buying some funny hats in the shop with coins you find during the levels, but the achievement to buy them all is rather grindy and requires to at least repeat the tutorial 30 additional times.

I’ll still give this a positive rating, just because it was not all bad, but it definitely wouldn’t be my first choice for a local coop game to have fun. Too much hassle in between, too little variety, and I’d wait for a good sale keeping the short game length in mind.",Recommended,37,0

Biped is a charming and cooperative puzzle-platformer that delivers a fun and lighthearted experience. You control adorable robots, ""Aku"" and ""Sila,"" as they traverse a series of levels that require precision, teamwork, and creative problem-solving. The game’s standout mechanic is its unique movement system, where each leg is controlled individually, adding an extra layer of challenge and hilarity as you wobble around.

The puzzles are well-designed and progressively more difficult, encouraging communication and coordination, especially in co-op mode. Whether you’re balancing on narrow platforms or solving timing-based puzzles, every moment feels like a fun test of your teamwork skills.

Visually, the game’s colorful, minimalist aesthetic adds to its charm, and the lighthearted soundtrack complements the cheerful vibe. However, the game is relatively short, and while it’s perfect for a few hours of fun, some players might wish for more content.

Overall, Biped is a delightful co-op game that shines in its simplicity and creativity. It’s an ideal choice for those looking to enjoy some light puzzle-solving with a friend.",Recommended,14,0

Biped is a fun little “puzzle” game with a well done main mechanic(which is movement). The game introduces some small new mechanics here and there but nothing too special. You can play Biped solo or co-op, but I would highly recommend co-op. So, it’s supposed to be a puzzle game, but I would not really call them puzzles. They are not challenging but that actually doesn’t even matter. They’re more like obstacles you have to pass with fun little mechanics.It’s just a blast to work together with your friend and mess around.

So to sum up, Biped is a fun little snack between other games, and it gave me and my friend a lot of laughs. But I don’t think I can recommend it to play solo. I would also wait for a good sale to pick it up as it’s only worth a couple of bucks in my opinion.",Recommended,13,0

Please, beware if you're buying the game to play online.

The game seems really fun if you're playing local, but online there's a gigantic issue regarding how the engine handles the connection.

My friend and I live in the same city, we both have relatively low ping; I have 15ms, he has 50-130 (a few spikes). My friend doesn't lag in most games, but this game is utterly unplayable. Somehow, the game decides that the lag between my friend's computer and me should be added as input lag into the game; so it's impossible for him and I to play the game, since it feels like we're playing on ice.

It should be noted that solo and co-op play, at least in my opinion seem to be quite a bit different in terms of difficulty. My wife and I played the game through the story in co-op via Xbox controllers. We had an incredible time, albeit, we did struggle a bit on a few stages. Over all, we both still enjoyed the game a lot. It is a rather short story to work through, although, there are bonus stages that we didn't go through which could add to the amount of time it takes you to complete it. The night we completed the story line, I played through the training and first stage solo. I purchased it solely to play co-op with my wife, and it was just out of curiosity that I started a solo game. It can certainly take patience to play it via co-op, but it was definitely worth the price to my wife and I. At one point, she flung me off a cylinder by accident, when she spun the gear far faster than she intended. This just after I warned her that she would have to spin it easy. We both had a great laugh from that.",Recommended,10,0

In Biped, each player controls their own robot. You have to move each leg of your robot independently, so it requires a fair amount of brain power to move with precision. Then you throw in difficult puzzle challenges which require you to co-ordinate well with your partner and you get a hilarious game where your friendship is tested.

It's pretty short, but it's definitely worth the money because:
* it's clearly made with care and love
* it's fairly cheap
* because of remote play, you only need one copy of the game to play with anyone you like
* there are awards for each level (time trial, etc) that encourage replayability
* it's fun to play through multiple times with different people because it's all about co-ordinating with your partner",Recommended,12,1

This game is incredibly fun, definitely a game to play with your gf/bf we could not stop laughing as we were pushing each other off cliff tops and sabotaging each other on the missions. As you have probably read on everyone else's review the game is very short, however that does not stop this game from being worth the money, for the few hours we played this game it was 100% worth the £10 each that if out on quarantine would probably be spent on a pizza. I do hope that the devs do add some sort of level creating system into this game as that would be quite good fun creating a level for others to play or browsing the workshop maps to play levels that others have created, i would also hope that they do add more official levels and other mechanics into the game at a later point as every time there is a new level we would be playing straight away.

Biped can be very frustrating or very rewarding or both at the same time. Good communication is needed with your partner or there will be a lot of potential yelling and blaming. However, if you're able to be a good sport and forgive mistakes while working together, then Biped is a really good co-op game. It reminds me of Portal 2 a bit in the cooperation aspect but the puzzles are more physical than mental.

A few puzzles can get frustrating so I recommend taking breaks as needed, but overall the game has a good progression of introducing a new concept to you and then repeating the concept in progressively more challenging scenarios.

I can't speak on the single-player but I found this to be a really rewarding co-op game with the right partner. It's a little short so maybe get it on sale, but I played it halfway once and then completed it on a second full run with a little idling, so the playtime is around 4 or 5 hours max depending on how quickly you can complete the puzzles and how much you want to go for extra coins.

For people having issues with online co-op, double check that you're both in the same region. It's a bit silly, but you need to be in the same region to join each others' rooms/games. I had more luck entering the room code than I did with Steam's invites system.

I cannot recommend a game with such a ridiculous bug!

FIX is here:
Hi adventurer,

Did you play the old version of the game? If so, you need to copy-paste your old save files to the new folder:
1) Please, opened the folder: %USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow/PostmetaGamesLimited/Biped
at your local PC.
2) Open the folder:
%USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow/NExTStudios/Biped
Copy-paste all the files from the 2-nd folder to the first one and launch the game. It should solve your save files problem.

Thank you",Recommended,7,0

Lots of fun when playing co-op, and not too difficult. The movement in the game is really neat and plays well with a controller. I'm usually a D-Pad only kind of player with controller, but using the 2 analog sticks was really entertaining with this game. Used a PS4 controller for this game, but any controller would probably work well. With this game, if playing co-op it's probably best to have two people that are somewhat decent at games and you communicate well with, would possibly be nearly impossible to play without voice calling.

------------------------------
Control Scheme I Used:
Gamepad, PS4 Controller because I like the analog sticks it. Can't use D-Pad but that's to be expected with type of movement mechanics in this game.

------------------------------
Worth the current price (CDN$ 17.49)? Yes, although you'll need 2 copies to play with a friend online, so maybe not then.
What I actually paid: $12.19

------------------------------
Completionist Review:
DLC Achievements: No DLC
Rating: Overall not too bad to get everything.
Can be completed in one run: Unlikely as you wouldn't earn enough coins in one playthrough.
Chapter Select: Yes, with clear indications as to which levels to replay, can also load individual checkpoints.
Did I need/use a guide? No.

You will need to play this game fully with co-op and single player, most of the completion stuff is just beating the game, 1 type of collectable, and replaying enough times to earn coins to unlock all outfits. Could be easily done with 2-3 playthroughs tops. Only a few levels had specific time and death achievements, although all levels have goals you can shoot for past the listed achievements.",Recommended,5,0

Biped is a game that I enjoy and it's nothing I had experienced before. Sure, you need a good partner to complete the coop adventure. This is why it's interesting. Me and my friend were looking for a good coop game for a moment now and biped just satisfied our demand. At the beginning, we looked clumsy when moving, but this game is all about communication and experience. After a while, we were able to resolve the puzzles more quickly and with less deaths. The synchronization with your partner is all that matters. It is not always easy to find the perfect rythym with your right and left foot and with the colored platforms. Well, it was a pretty good time. A lot of fun with this one, I recommend yes. But not for everyone.",Recommended,5,0

This game is excellent - purchased to play together with hubby and so much fun. Ramps up the difficulty nicely, and ends up with a lot of laughing at each other over the inability to alternate steps! I had a blast 100% ing this - I did have to 'cheat' for one solo level and use the keyboard rather than over the controllers for one speed slide challenge as found had much better steering with keyboard and mouse for the fine coordination challenges. Controller more fun to laugh at ourselves though!

My 13 yr old and 6 yr old can also play this and have fun - Mr 6 was able to complete the solo main story via keyboard and mouse controls.

Finally a sequel to ARMS: LEGS!

It’s like Octodad except with cute little robots. It’s a really fun game to play with your wife’s boyfriend.

I first played this on the Switch and I was almost able to beat the game without touching the controller thanks to all the joycon drift doing it themselves! Glad to report it works a lot better on the Steam Deck.

It’s a perfect date game. Fun platformer and party game for you and a friend. Bought this when I saw it come out to play with my wife’s boyfriend and it's a super fun and unique co-op game.

In the game, each player controls the legs of a robot using the analog sticks. The left analog stick controls the left leg, and the right analog stick controls the right leg. Using them in conjunction allows you to skate around and knock each other off the edge, providing some hilarious moments.

It might be a cute game but don’t sell it short because of that, l'm a decent gamer and sometimes I struggled to keep up with some of the challenges. The teamwork required during this game is phenomenal. Try not to get too angry.

Depending on how you approach it, and how good you and your partner work together, you could probably get through the main campaign around the 4 hour mark, but collecting everything will obviously add multiple hours to that.

I like short games like this that don't overstay their welcome. It makes it easy to play through in one sitting when someone comes over, like watching a movie with someone versus watching a series with them. I'd definitely recommend picking it up, specially on a sale.

I'm not a big lover of coop games but Biped really got my attention and that's why:

1) Strange but funny walking - in this game you won't fing regular WASD controls. Instead of that you can contorl YOUR LEGS. Literally. Left and right stick let you move the biped's left or right leg. For the first 15 minutes it feels very strange but then you will used to.

2) Great puzzles - well, I LOVE puzzles and there are a lot of them from the easy ones to very very hard!

3) Cooperation! You can play Biped solo but I strongly recommend you to try it with your friend or soulmate. The vast majority of the puzzle section will create fummy situation. Also the cooperative mode of Biped is the chance to understand how strong your friendship really is! :)

This game is fairly simple and straight forward about it's core mechanics. The controls felt very innovative and I must say, I have never played anything like it before and it is tremendous amounts of fun!!! Also, the robots are very cute, well animated and made me bond with them in an instant.
With Biped you and your fellow player will laugh, yell, puzzle and enjoy almost every minute of it, while feeling like a true team along the way, which the level and puzzle layouts promote nicely. For those who want even more coordinated cooperative gameplay, the puzzle missions add just the right amount of difficulty to have somewhat of a game outside of the main game, once that is finished, which can be done in a couple of hours / over the course of a few evenings.

Altogether, you can tell that the developers aspired to create something unique, ""balancedly"" challenging and, team-building and, as mentioned before of course, fun.

The gameplay idea left me thinking that there would be many more possible puzzle types and fresh spins on the core mechanics. This is by no means a detriment to the game, it just means that, should there ever be any DLCs or even a sequel, I will most certainly give it a go. Fully recommended for those looking for a cooperative game, that you can play specifically with 2 players.",Recommended,5,0

Didn't realize we had beaten it as we ended after the end with the idea of coming back. But we did, so time to review:
Game has very cute graphics and nice music. It was nice throughout.
I enjoy the fact that we can beat up and mug the NPCs, and the mechanics are pretty good once you get used to the movement.

Now, that said... there are a few puzzles that were rough and at least one that felt unnecessary for online co-op. There is tunnel crossing controlled by a switch, and if the partner has ANY sort of latency this becomes very painful. It was clearly tested with couch co-op because even a half second increases the difficulty by a very huge margin. I'd really have appreciated if, after enough fails, we get a ""Skip"" option, or if the developers were able to test with someone in another State/Country and make adjustments to the breathing room.

And on the topic of co-op, the lobby is painful. ""Lobby is full"" with one person, failures to invite, and more. They have a beta for better client that we didn't know about until the end, but this really should have been added to the main system at some point in the last few years.

With that said: It was still enjoyable, we got a good number of laughs and I don't regret playing. The amount of frustration was acceptable and I'd still recommend, just try to play with people closer or go into the Betas and get the betterping one before struggling.",Recommended,3,0

Well rounded coop game either local or online both worked granted it will require a friend to play coop mode as the single player mode will take around 1-2 hours and coop mode about the same but there’s extra pro levels which are just sets of 3 puzzles which again adds a few hours play time just trying to work some of them out I’d recommend using a voice chat as it will be painful at some of the points if your just trying to wing it had a few lag spikes happened more on pro levels (unsure if game or steam) which results in death for 1 or both of you but get reset just before the puzzle so doesn’t really matter in all fair ness the only achievement which requires a small grind is “Tread Hunters” requires doing training solo for 90 coins a complete run

Saw this some hours ago while randomly browsing Steam. Told a friend about it and we decided to buy the game and give it a go as we were really bored and wanted something casual and fun to spend the time while we are social distancing due to the virus. I'd like to say for the few hours I played this I enjoyed it a lot. It's beautiful, ""fluffy"", smooth, and super chill and worth the cost. The only issue we faced with the game was a lag spike that looked like it was affecting frames but it wasn't, it just momentarily froze the game because of the ping spike. Besides that the game runs super smooth and is quick to get the hang of and becomes intuitive. I can't wait to see the potential of player made maps if that's in their to-do list or not. I would love to see 3 or 4 player cap to add more to the chaos but for a co-op it is super beautiful.

Overall I 100% recommend this if you and a friend are looking for something to have a nice and casual fun session.

I plan on updating the review upon playing it further later.",Recommended,6,0

This game is an absolute fantastic product of what CO-OP games should be. My friend and I both got this game, and I only have played 30-ish minutes of this game which is about 3 levels. Right when I opened up the game, the music was cheerful and the graphics were cute. Straight off the tutorial on where you were learning how to move in this game, I go to my friend and I'm say ""oh no, I already know how this will go."" It is absolute CHAOS, but it is SO MUCH FUN. The movement in this game is fun and sometimes hilarious, puzzles are quite difficult sometimes, and it's just an overall fun time.

The game is pretty good so far the main story took around 3 - 4 hours to complete but there's more additional pro levels for additional challenge and to collect all customization and achievements. Encountered a bug on one of the levels and there's some minor framerate drop but impressed with developers fast replies and action. You should grab the game if you want to play with your friends its much more fun and chaotic to play with someone instead of playing single player. 8/10 get it its a friendship killer game too",Recommended,5,1

Biped is a 3D Puzzle game, where you or / and friend controlling a robot, and your job is to restart all of the beacons on Earth, before the catastrophe, meanwhile you need to solve puzzles.

My favourite part in Biped, is the gameplay. It's short with not too many levels, but the puzzles and the levels itself don't feel boring at all. Some levels are challanging, you need to really get used to the controlls, which I will get to it later. You can collect coins, stars and completing the levels in time for achivments or for coins, you can buy hats, which adds to the fun factor. The game is a bit childish, but it's for everyone and can bring fun to you alone or to your friend, too. There are also additional levels, which ramp up the difficulty, after you beat the game, if you need extra challange. Long story short, pretty fun gameplay with new elements and not boring at all.

Controlls seemed bit difficult for me at first, but it was really good. I played the game with controller, due to the game recommended it. You basically controlling the two legs of Biped with the two joystick, which seems bit difficult, but later in the game, you will get used to it. It's responsive and easy to get into, but hard to master it.

Surprisingly graphics is also a strong point of the game. It's a fact, that further textures not looking detailed at all, but the graphics in general fits for the game. I didn't saw any graphics bugs either, it's just wholesome.

Sound desing is also nice. There are no dialouges, only beeping but those are not annoying in my opinion. Pretty good stuff.

Story is basically told at the beginning, which is Earth has beacons and Bipeds needs to restart it, before something bad happens. Simple is that, however there is no need for additional story. Few of the levels has some story with different robots, which is just enough for the end of the level, and that's all right.

Biped surprisingly a really solid puzzle game, with cute graphics and design, yet challanging gameplay at some point, but not annoyingly hard. The only issue is that the game is quite short, but the solo and coop campaign together could give you enough gameplay. I can defiently recommend the game, even for the full price!",Recommended,2,1

Really fun to play with a friend, but I'd recommend playing with a person that doesn't give up easily. Some levels can be challenging. But don't give up, you'll both find the solution eventually. But if you want as much content as possible, you'll require a friend. The solo mode is pretty boring but still fun, but a tutorial of some sorts if you're gonna play with a friend. I liked the NPC bots, they were pretty adorable and so were Aku and Sila. The 100% requirements with the time and minimum amount of deaths is a good challenge, but can be difficult with a friend. Though in the tutorial you can't get 100% Harmony, because there are no challenges, so actual 100% is technically impossible.",Recommended,5,1

A fine but somewhat rudimentary puzzly 3D platformer where the main gimmick is that you and (in case you have one handy) a partner team up to wobble onwards on two wonky bipeds. The main gameplay is that you flop around like two drunks trying to put your slippery appendages on things to make lights shine, so it's basically an ordinary night at the most seedy nightclub you can imagine.. All in all a fine yet pretty short puzzle adventure that is best enjoyed in company with your favorite companion. Buy it at a discount and ignore the complimentary ingame shop..",Recommended,3,0

biped is co-op for masochists who want to learn to hate their friends.

Fantastic hidden gem of a co-op game. But wait, I've only got 3 hours gameplay?!

SO MUCH RAGE QUITTING.

I can only take it in short bursts, as the internal fury at my online partner builds when they misplace their tiny robot feet, Lucky, the feeling is mutual.

Pros
- Great aesthetic - similar to a Nintendo game
- Unique Gameplay - moving a foot with each joystick.
- Well designed puzzles that are continually surprising


- Can only play in short bursts
- In each ""world"" only one level (of three) are themed. The other two are in a portal-like training ground. The themed levels are amazing, but a bit dissappointing that there aren't more

This was a fun game to play with a friend. It's very short aside from the extra pro levels you can do. The game was very cute like Wall-E and the control was pretty decent once you get the hang of it. Certain puzzles had that ""It looks good on paper"" vibe but kinda iffy pulling them off. Game has little to no story but given what the game play is, that's to be expected. I enjoyed murdering my friend from time to time. The game is SHORT will take you maybe a top 6 hours to beat the main story. Cute sound track overall very fun.

Worms Rumble is an example of how to NOT do a online service. I respect Team 17 and their developers but its very apparent that this is their first attempt for a fully online experience.

This game is fun and I really enjoy it when I get around to playing it but my god is the waiting times a chore. If i'm not waiting 5-10 minutes if i'm lucky with 1/6th of the lobby filled, I'm waiting for the game to boot me out of searching for that match to reset the process.

The games bugs make the game almost unfun to play half the time. Any projectile based weapon like a bazooka or a plasma gun just clip through the map and do no damage. The shield will sometimes lose its collision box and just become a useless piece of junk and a mark on your back. The fact these bugs have been going on since launch its obvious they're never going to get around to fixing them due to their only interest being cosmetic fluff.

The game was basically dead on arrival only ever able to scrape 600 players at launch and the only reason why the game isn't dead is because of Playstation Plus. And, with no interest as it seems to adding more platforms for the game to exist on I doubt the issue of dying will ever be fixed before its too late.

Their roadmap is shocking and depressing its almost like they know their game is doomed to fall and they're trying to cover it up. Don't just say more information coming soon and only showing the next month this might be aggressive but your game is dying and it only feels like you're trying to squeeze out every penny you can before it sinks.

Overall, Worms Rumble is a sinking ship thats only repairs are with sticky tape and twigs. Take my 100 hours as advice to never buy this game unless they seriously add more then 4 arenas, 5 gamemodes and 24/7 online play which barely functions.

P.S: If anyone is interested in knowing what i'd fix in this game I have a link here:

Edit: (27/2/2020) This will probably be the last time I address this game but I just wanted to list every bug that isn't fixed to this day and when I noticed them.

Been playing worms since Armageddon. I really like the idea of this game and the gameplay is fun. But the game is completely dead.

After about 10 minutes of getting stomped by the tiny player base that had max level characters, I tried queuing up for the battle royal mode. Another 10 minutes in queue and I gave up. Steam charts told me everything I needed to know about the play base. Hope I can get a refund.

Pros
Decent variety of weapons
Gameplay feels fluid and fun for the most part
DLC packs add more purely cosmetic customisation options
Crossplatform parties/lobbies

Your mileage may vary
The real-time style is a stark departure from the typical turn-based fare of the series

Cons
Alarmingly low playerbase
Imbalanced matchmaking (likely caused by the above)
Don't expect to have good ping unless you're based in EU
Large, but few maps
Online multiplayer only

Was the writing already on the wall at the time of the announcement? Hard to tell. , announced for the series' 25th anniversary, eschews with the turn-based nature of its predecessors and shifts to a real-time style more akin to and .

Honestly, it's way more fun than it would seem. I've been a fan for as long as I remember, gaming with my cousins on a bootleg version of , with my school mates on even more , then finally amassing my collection on Steam over the years. Suffice to say, I definitely miss the turn-based nature, and some of the wacky weapons we got in the past games (among my friend group, I was the undisputed Aqua Sheep king) - but does partly make up for it with a more concentrated variety of weapons that mostly still feel rather solid.

But let's take a look at the elephant in the room. You can tend to gauge how well a game has sold by the number of reviews, even if they only count Steam reviews. (with 320k+) massively took off, and even though the playerbase has obviously decreased since then, there are still thousands playing the game daily. The same cannot be said for , which is languishing on 1/356 of that amount, and a Steam player count of 2 digits. The only reason lobbies can still even be found are due to the PlayStation playerbase that got it from PS Plus, which at least is the one tactical masterstroke the game launched with.

This severely thin playerbase, I'm guessing, is what has led to the matchmaking being seemingly imbalanced. When I tried it out during the free weekend, I admit I criticised it too harshly, claiming it was programmed by ""literal donkeys"". In retrospect, that's a pretty unfair assessment, because what can you do when there's so few people playing it? You'll just get matched up against the same pros over and over again because there aren't too many players at a similar skill level rushing in to queue into matches; you're just thrown in at the deep end. And that's not including the fact that I can't even find matches for Last Squad/Worm Standing either.

Also, I'm based in the eastern side of the world - and searching for matches on the automatic setting just throws me into Europe games because there is no other playerbase; just the EU folk. This results in me having to play at a perpetual ping disadvantage. Fun, eh?

In actuality, I do find myself liking this game and wanting it to somehow succeed; this is still a pretty fun addition to the series, despite this dramatic shakeup. It's just a shame that the abysmal playerbase is causing quite a lot of problems.

Unfortunately, I can only suggest to get this on any form of sale. Humble Choice June 2021 was an option (and where I got mine), but it now also goes on 90%-off discounts on Steam. There are too many questions regarding this game's longevity, and getting it at full-price is a questionable decision at best. If you were lucky enough to claim it for free on PS Plus back on launch day, there is no point to double-dipping; just enjoy your copy of the game from there.",Recommended,24,2

Something needs to be done.

I bought this game and all its DLC on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and PS5. I did this because all I want is to see every Worms game succeed so we can continue to see more entries released implementing new game-changing mechanics. Unfortunately it is not an enjoyable experience to play this game in its current state.

You will only find matches if you queue up for quick play. Even then it can take up to 10 minutes to find a match, and when it does there will only be at most 5 people in the game. Of those 5 people, at least 1 of them will be a level capped player with upwards of 5 million lifetime damage. The team this player is assigned to will win. It makes it feel like the other individual players don’t matter, as these matches typically end with scores 20 to 1.

This issue likely drives new players away, which is problematic because this contributes to the lack of players online. So few players online renders multiple daily challenges impossible to complete. The majority of daily challenges must be completed in specific game modes. Game modes that you cannot queue up for, as the only queue you will find matches in is quick play.

Because of this, daily challenges are painstakingly slow to complete, as it’s a coin toss whether or not quick play will put you in the game mode you need to complete the challenge.

This makes the game feel very devoid of purpose when everything is solely dependent on luck. Will you win the match? Depends on if you get teamed with the 3,000+ hour playtime veteran. Will the match you waited 10 minutes for be relevant for your daily challenges? Depends on the mercy of quick play.

Neither of these issues can be resolved by queuing up with a friend, as my friend and I have tested, two players queued separately for one game mode does not create a new lobby. You will both sit in queue until it times out and disconnects you.

The only clear resolution to these issues would be to get new players. Whether or not this means becoming free to play, I don’t know. All I know is that if SOMETHING is not done, this game is going to die.",Not Recommended,30,0

Worms Rumble is a 2.5D fast-paced real-time combat, instead of turn-based the franchise is known for, where worms fight each other for laughs and giggles. I played on both PC and PS5 (it was free for PS Plus owners last month). There are three game modes: Deathmatch (free-for-all) and Last Squad/Worm Standing (fast-paced battle royale). I was a little irritated at first that they chose this route, but after playing for quite some time I started to enjoy it.

Pros:
✔️ Intense and fun gameplay: Play Deathmatch if you want to have cause mayhem and kill other worms as much as possible, or Last Squad/Worm Standing (where 32 players are against one another, group of three or solo) and be the last man/squad standing, while using iconic weapons and items from previous games, such as the sheep launcher and the holy grenade.
✔️ You can fight other players online across console and PC. Don’t let the steam player count fool you, the game is very much alive and it doesn’t take me too long to find a match, especially since it was free for PS Plus owners last month.
✔️ The 2.5D cartoonish graphics are very different and vibrant, compared to the previous games, and they look pretty good
✔️ didn’t face any technical issues, just buttery smooth 60fps.

❌ Don’t buy this game if you are looking for some single-player content.
❌ There are only four maps and three of which look somewhat identical to one another.
❌ It’s not turn based and require less strategy. On the other hand, I don’t blame them for choosing this route; change is good and there are plenty of single-player games on steam, plus not a lot of people are fond of turn based combat.


There are disconnection issues, according to other reviews. Fortunately, I haven't experienced one, not even on the PS5. In conclusion, if you want to play fast-paced PVP matches, using some of the most ridiculous weapons out there, then I recommend it, especially since it’s only $15. If you are looking for single-player content and some good turn-based combat, then I recommend and (my personal favorite).",Recommended,33,4

Follow my Curator Page for more Strategy Games!

Worms Rumble is a battle royale game with cross-play. It's basically Worms without having to wait for your turn and available on Steam, Playstation 4, and Playstation 5.

There are three different modes, ten weapons, a handful of items (different grenades, jetpack, etc.), and three maps. You can customize your character with innumerable cosmetic items as well as your weapons with different skins. You level up by playing the game and unlock new cosmetic items which you then have to buy for coins. You can't buy coins with real money. There are no microtransactions in the game!

Deathmatch is one of the modes available to play. It works just as in every other game. 8 minutes, respawns and the one with the most kills wins. On the map are several crates with loot in them. That way, you can find better/different weapons, med-kits, grenades, and more. You also recover some health after time.
In the beta, you had to wait 15 seconds or more 'til you could respawn. Fortunately, they changed it in the full game. You can now immediately respawn. It's a quite nice improvement and shows that the devs listen to the community.

The main attractions of the game are the battle royal modes - Last Worm Standing and Last Squad Standing. The first one lets you play alone against 31 other worms. Just like in other BR games, the map gets smaller after some time. In Worms Rumble, you don't immediately die if you're out of the safe zone. The map shows you which area gets toxic and you'll lose health every few seconds if you're in it. There's enough time to leave the area if you pay attention.
Losing early is kind of frustrating since the matchmaking takes a bit longer here. The game recommends starting this mode if you reach level 10 with indicates you're not a beginner anymore.

Last Squad Standing is a battle royale with teams of three players. You can either invite your friends to play or get random teammates. One of you decides where your team spawns on the map. After that, it's the same as LWS. This mode is recommended for players who reach level 5 but you can play both modes immediately after starting the game for the first time.

Worms Rumble is a multiplayer-only game. Steamcharts shows that the player count is pretty small right now (Not even 1000 players on release day usually indicates the game is dead in a few weeks/months). Thanks to cross-play you don't have to worry about that. The game is well alive and matchmaking takes 30 seconds the most. The game is free if you have PlayStation plus which secures a healthy player base.

Having that many customization options is a good thing. Especially since there are no microtransactions and you can get everything by playing the game. It's also very playable with a controller and there is no real advantage for M+K users which makes it a casual experience overall.
It's a competitive game for sure but easier for everyone who never got a chicken dinner in similar BR games. I even got first place in Deathmatch in the beta after playing like five matches and chicken dinner in LSS in my second match with random teammates (me having the most kills) and I'm not a pro player by any means.

The game is fun and these little Worms are as charming as ever. The one thing we have to wait for is longevity. Will they add more maps, weapons, or even modes for free in the future? Maybe tournaments, special events, or challenges (There are daily challenges at least for now)? If they can deliver new content fast enough, they can make it worth it.
Otherwise, I'm not quite sure the game will be fun for solo-players in the long run. Playing with friends is a blast though and it's definitely worth it if you got friends to play with!",Recommended,75,5

Please, do not buy the game. I've checked on several occasions, there's nobody online. You literally cannot play this game because it's specifically Multi Player and does not allow for Single Player. It's Dead.

I thought I'd give this game the benefit of the doubt after reading reviews stating that the game isn't dead but rather, it is active at certain time frames.

This appears to be completely invalid information as I have checked at many different times on what would be peak periods (weekends) and had no luck.

I truly feel sorry for the developer of worms as this game has had a lot of time and money invested, and I have no doubt that it's very enjoyable. The unfortunate thing is, it's simply unplayable.",Not Recommended,20,0

This really looked like an interesting idea to me, but something must have been terribly wrong because no one is playing it. Since the game is multiplayer only and there aren't enough players to start a match it's sadly a dead game. From what I've read if you do find a match there's a good chance you'll run into some kind of hacker so that might be related to it's lack of player base. :-(",Not Recommended,30,7

Worms finally has a game in the franchise that features real-time combat.
Do I prefer this over turn-based Worms? Sometimes.
Do I think all worms games should be real time from now on? No.
That being said, I think it's a great addition to the Worms franchise.
There are a few things I think long time fans will find questionable. The Bazooka has no charge up time and shoots in a straight line. There's no wind mechanics. All weapons can be fired while moving. This is a very different Worms experience. It's basically SOLDAT with a highly polished Worms theme.
The modes currently available are Deathmatch (Solo), Last Team Standing (trio BR) and Last Worm Standing (solo BR).
The game has unlockable skins like you'd find in other shooters like Call of Duty or Counterstrike, as well as cosmetic items to customize your Worm with.
Overall I think the game looks and plays great and as long as you know what to expect you should really enjoy this entry in the series.",Recommended,20,0

Ok, so where do i begin with this...

Cons:
1. the market is over saturated with games like these, i get you want to appeal to a new audience but this feels lazy
2. single player is practically gutted in favor of ""training"" if you can even call it that, ""oh look, targets that just stand there! this will provide me with such a challenge!!"" like, nearly no one says that, its just a shooting range.
3. there is nearly NO strategy in this game you just shoot and hope for the best, no turns or anything.
4. the cosmetics look good but it feels like EA using their cold marketing schemes to get all the money out of the customers pockets, that's just lame.

Pros:
1. the art style looks good
2. you can change the voice of the worms i guess
3. the weapons are somewhat creative

Overall this game is a disgrace to the worms franchise

I wasn't sold on this concept but I've played every worms game I can get my hands on so mild OCD took over. I would say this is a solid ""yeah this is fun to jump into a match or two while I wait for friends to get online"" experience. It seems to be shooting for the same chaotic multiplayer feeling that Fall Guys was going for, which works well enough for now, although I would like to see more objective based gameplay (capture the flag or king of the hill) in the future.

Overall, It's an interesting take on the Worms franchise, with no real risk involved. If I want to play something more tactical or with challenges, there's like 25 years of history to go back through on PC alone that I can always return to.

I worry a bit about the playerbase, but that will work itself out one way or the other over the next month or so, and being crossplay AND free on Playstation will help with those numbers, but it is worth noting that as of launch week it has not broken into the top 100 current steam games .",Recommended,22,0

Let's Get Ready To Rumble!!! Upon starting the game for the first time, you will be asked if you would like to enable Cross-Platform Gameplay. It doesn’t really matter which you choose right now as you can enable and disable the feature in the settings. Next, you’ll be asked if you wish to Begin Training or Go to Menu.

On the main menu screen along the top of the screen you’ll find, Play, The Lab, Worm and Weapons, Your Rank, Name, Money, Stats, Friends and Settings. On the left of the screen is some of the latest news, along with three daily challenges to unlock. In completing these challenges you’ll gain a gift reward of some sort. Beneath these is where you choose your Game Mode, hitting the Play button will then search for a game. You might want to go into the options and set the matchmaking region to the closest one available to you. There are four matchmaking regions, Central Europe, US West, US East and Asia, if you are unsure of which to choose you can set it too Automatic.

The Game Modes on offer currently are Deathmatch, Last Squad Standing and Last Worm Standing. Training can also be found along with the game modes. The Last Man Standing is recommended once you have reached Level Five, while Last Worm Standing is recommended that you be Level Ten.

Selecting to go through training will take you over the basics, how to move, jump shoot, throw grenades etcetera as you make your way through the training area. Reaching the end, you will arrive at an assault course, here you have Target Practice and Armoury. Target Practice is where you need to take out Twenty targets in the quickest time possible. In the Armoury you can mess around with all weapons, grenades and equipment. If you wish you can also take the toys around the assault course for a spin.

There is one more game mode The Lab, each week there will be specific rules and map. This week's Lab Mode is Melee Only Deathmatch where the only weapon you’ll use is the Baseball Bat on the map Missile Mall. There’s also a Weekly Reward, with this week's reward being a Pink Dinosaur outfit (yes, I do look good in it but as it’s Chrimbo Season I’m rocking a red reindeer outfit with snowflakes and a golden nose).

While in a match you’ll have to keep your mince pies on your stamina. Rolling and Wall Jumping to get around the map will eat into your stamina. You can always crawl along at worm speed to save some stamina but if you really want to get your botty moving then you’re going to have to start rolling. There are other forms of moving around from place to place if you can get your hands on the Jetpack or Grabble Hook.

You start with One-Hundred health and once it’s gone you die; you will respawn after a few seconds (at least in deathmatch). Collecting First Aid Boxes or Cans of Energy Drink, these can replenish your health if you can manage to get it down your neck before someone comes along and spanks your botty. You can carry two weapons at one time and you’ll get random weapons, equipment from a crate at the start of each round. More weapons can be found after being dropped from fellow defeated worms.

After each match you’ll be rewarded with Experience Points and Coins depending on how well you did. You will get a Breakdown of the match and earn experience points and coins in Match Completed, Eliminations, Damage and Position. These experience points will Level Up your character. You also get a Breakdown on any Weapons used, you will gain Experience Points in Eliminations, Damage and Time Held, these points will Level Up that weapon. Gaining experience and coin will unlock new weapon skins, costumes, look and other customisable items for your character.

In the settings you’ll find options for Audio - Master, Gameplay, Music, Speech and Announcer Volume Sliders, also here is Audio Output Device. Video - Display Mode, Resolution, Resolution Scale, V-Sync, Limit FPS and Max FPS. Brightness, Render Quality, Ambient Occlusion, Anti-Aliasing, SSR, Bloom, Shadow Quality, Post Process Quality and Particle Detail.

Game - Auto-Switch Empty Weapons, Auto-Switch New Weapon, Nameplates, Enemy Health Bars, Roll Toggle. Account – Cross-Platform Play (On/Off) and Matchmaking Region (Automatic, Europe Central, US West, US East and Asia). Accessibility - Colour Blind Mode, Held Buttons and Screen Shake.

Controller - Controller Bindings, Aim Sensitivity, Aim Assist, Movement Aim, Vibration, Left and Right Stick Deadzone. Mouse & Keyboard - Movement, Action and Equipment Bindings.

I’ve enjoyed playing Worms Rumble, especially the Melee Only Deathmatch (this weeks The Lab game mode). I chose the Europe region for matchmaking with me coming from England. The game seemed to run pretty smooth, I never felt like I was lagging at all.

Searching for a game doesn’t hasn’t taken too long to find one, a minute or two at most. Although I do have cross-platform multiplayer selected in the options so as to make sure I get a game, which hasn‘t been a problem so far. I haven’t tried to search for a game against just Steam players, I don’t mind spankin’ the botty of other platform gamers using my keyboard and mouse … All Hail the PC Master Race!!!

I have had a Network Error occur three or four times, one of these errors occurred while in game and I was kicked out. While the other times I got the errors when trying to connect to a game. Other than that, Worms Rumble is a refreshingly fun and enjoyable game.

Positives
+ Fun and enjoyable to play
+ Nice graphics
+ Multiple game modes
+ Cross-Platform multiplayer
+ Full controller support
+ Has achievements

Negatives
- Network errors
- No cards currently

The game is actually really fun, and I wouldn't say it's necessarily ""true"" to the series in the sense of gameplay because it was basically rewritten all over again, but that's almost what makes it more fun than I expected. I work a lot and have tons of other games to play, and that's the real reason I think this game has a low player population. I grew up playing the old ones, and I loved the changes Mayhem made. For me, Mayhem turned the series from a 2D to a 3D environment, and it was all revolutionary and fresh. That game gets a lot of hate too, and I've sunk countless hours into it, as well as the series overall. Rumble is a really decent game, and it has the potential to be more if Team 17 does anything else with it. I'm here for this one, the old ones, and I'll be here for the next Worms.",Recommended,11,0

Review by Gaming Masterpieces - The greatest games of all time on Steam.

Is this game a masterpiece? Well, it is an online only multiplayer brawler. Can this be an eternal masterpiece?

After it's 1995 Amiga release, Worms became one of the larger franchises in gaming history. Now, after about a dozen games in the series, Worms Rumble is the first online-only and real-time Worms. Quite a change from the usual formula. So lets say this clearly - the game mechanics are completely different from older Worms games.

You get a real-time, online multiplayer action game. Kill all other worms, excluding your team in the team modes. The roots of Worms are still here - from the banana grenade to the attacking sheep, but if you want slower turn-based Worms gameplay, stay with the (reasonably good) Worms W.M.D. or Armageddon. Worms Rumble comes with 2 basic game modes, either (Team) Deathmatch to score the most kills or Last Squad/Worm Standing to survive, both in Team or FFA mode. The matchmaking is automatic, but you can invite friends. Servers are populated atm, so you will find a deathmatch game with short waiting time. Rounds take a few minutes, and you unlock tons of cosmetic items to dress your worm. There are also a bunch of cosmetic DLCs available, if you still don't like your looks.

Gameplay is frantic, the controls are responsive, it is easy to score a few kills even for beginners. Collect the spawning loot boxes to receive better weapons (or health, ammo), jump or roll around the (few) well-thought out and large levels, shoot with your gun/rocket launcher or throw (holy) grenades - that's it, basically. Fun, but probably not a masterpiece.

Quick disclaimer: The player base is rather dead. If you don't want to play only on weekends, it will be difficult to find active lobbies.

Nevertheless, Worms Rumble is a really good game. It has the classic Worms look in newer and better graphics. Furthermore, the gameplay is quite simple, but entertaining. Kill the other worms in a 2D map. Everyone moves their own worm in real time, which is a departure from the classic games. The choice of weapons is very large, and it is easy to get into the game. The choice of maps and game modes is also solid.

I'm not even complaining; I mean, for what it's worth the game is functional, great-looking and smooth... However, you'd rather play other ""better"" party-based online games like ""Fall Guys"".

Being part of the Worms universe (If you don't know Worms, just scroll down NOW), the game remains true to the whole premise that you're in control of an armed and dangerous worm that slithers around the battlefield, killing other worms to win the game. In Worms Rumble, you've got different modes, all of which would optimally require 40 or more players... You can really visualise what they tried to do here: complete rumble and mayhem as 40 or more worms are trying to kill each other for the high score or to be the last worm standing... The game, however, is deserted... with very few veterans still playing it.

The queue time is actually short, believe it or not, and the game would start with ten players that probably only play this game, because I've played two games so far with the exact same ten people twice... Ten worms that start with bazookas, sniper rifles, sheep that explode? homing missiles... every single weaponry that looks like it would take you over 500 hours playing this dead game to get... You can imagine my frustration at being able to hit literally nobody with my cute pink pistol that does crap damage lol.

Because the game is deserted, you're faced with only one of two options: keep playing the game, getting completely obliterated every single game by the same few people that still play it? Or go play something else. Well, an achievement hunter knows his choices, you should know yours. For the smooth gameplay, I'm ranking this game slightly over a grade that would put it into the red zone, with . Great premise and execution; abandonned too early!",Recommended,29,0

I didn't want to have to not recommend this game.

When I initially saw the trailers for Worms Rumble, I thought, ""Ooh, this is a fun twist on the original concept."" I figured it was different enough from your typical battle royale to stand out a little more. I even decided to preorder the game, because I genuinely love the Worms series, and Team17 has put out a lot of games I enjoy.

Do I enjoy playing Worms Rumble? Yes, absolutely. But can I recommend it to anyone? No, not at the stage it's in. I hadn't played for a while, so I hopped on today to do a few deathmatches. First time I tried to get into a game, I waited a few minutes before cancelling and trying again. This has been an issue in the past that I've noticed. Then when I finally did get into the game, I seemed to be playing with a lot of the same people. Each match was dominated, of course, by a few diehard, level 50 players.

This game is slowly sinking, and the devs don't seem too keen on doing anything about it. It's been, what, half a year since we got any sort of update or event? The rewards system is, ironically, unrewarding. And frankly, I'm not terribly interested in investing time into a game that's gonna eventually go offline once there's no profit to be made from it. Once that happens, all our time and money will have been for nothing.

So yeah, go play Worms WMD instead.",Not Recommended,9,1

NO PRIVATE LOBBYS/ ARENAS! You can't play with your friends in a private arena!

The game is realy fun, and would be played way more often, but this missing feature makes it unplayable. I don't want to be farmed by strangers, I want to have fun with my friends.

I blame this failure of a game on bad marketing. It's actually REALLY fun! I'm rather upset about it because this is the kind of rumble tournament game I've been looking for (something not FPS or any platform that people have been used to). It would seem the game was thrashed by die hard worms fans because it's not the typical turn based and destructible terrain platform we all love.

THERE IS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH! Well, very few and the load time takes forever only to get into a game with way less than the expected 32 player cap. So, this sucks. I hope they make it free-to-play. I could see this game really evolving into something great with more weapons, fighting styles, etc. It's not very clever to adopt a successful game type (battle royale) and then compromise by charging for the game. MAKE IT POPULAR and then have micro transactions....

I always wanted to learn how to ninja rope like the pros in Worms 1999. Now there is Worms Rumble, a real time action game with ninja ropes. The jetpack will probably give you a bigger advantage, but that's ok since ninja roping is way more fun! There were many bugs we came across at the release, but after a week the devs fixed most of them and continue to work hard making the game better. The devs always replied to my concerns and complaints in the forums. There are many complaints about wanting destructible environments, girders, land mines, and other cherished worms related things, but as you can see this is a real time action game and not turn based so I welcome the new changes.

The game can be unfair at times, but I think that is the nature of ""Battle Royale"" type games. The spawns can give quite a challenge when you are randomly thrown into a small area with lots of other players. Look for the ninja-rope or jetpack and get away as fast as possible, but don't forget to rescue your team mates! For long term playability, there are many hats and vanity items to collect and of course you can change the voice of your worm. I'm sure they have more maps, weapons, game modes planned for the future.

Overall it is a great game with intense action, just needs a few more updates to polish glitches in movement/clipping. Most of the time I can play for hours perfectly, but can randomly crash. I recommend it regardless of the issues we had since the devs fixed game breaking problems very quickly.",Recommended,9,0

While I have praised Worms Rumble in the past, as much as I enjoyed my time with it, this game is as dead as the dodo.

There are barely any players, if none at all, active after 2 months of it being released. Matchmaking takes forever. They should at least have bots to play with or fill the gaps.

They keep adding worthless DLCs, leading me to believe this should be a free-to-play game instead. I understand they need to maintain a server, but there are better ways to capitalize a game.

There aren't enough rewards to justify playing, other than bragging rights and unlocking, what else, more cosmetics.


It's a real shame. I really liked this game, but I can't recommend it to anyone in its current state.

And no, the excuse of doesn't hold water. They clearly stated it's a battle-royale arena shooter, not a turn-based strategy game. Hell, the screenshots and the trailers they show clearly show you what this game is.

First things first this game is not dead like others have said. The player numbers on steam are pitifully low at around 8 but this game has cross-play so i was never waiting more than a minute for a game. This game isn't very new player friendly with new players being put into lobbies with max level 80,000 kill players but I don't think this is a reason to not play. Worms has always being a game you play with friends to have a good time with silly little worms with silly little weapons and Worms Rumble is just that but a bit more chaotic and a lot more fast paced. At the price I paid for it I had a good time but wouldn't pay full price. If you can get it on sale or if it ever goes free to play I fully suggest giving it a go.",Recommended,13,0

If you are looking for a regular Worms game, this is not one of them. If you are looking for a fun Worms spin-off (akin to Worms Golf or Worms Blast), then you are about have a wonderful time! I played both the alpha and the beta of this game, so my in-game time isn't fully accurate.

This is an incredibly fun fast-packed 2D arena shooter. There are currently 3 maps and 3 modes:
- Deathmatch (get the most kills)
- Last Worm Standing (Battle Royale)
- Team Last Worm Standing (3-worm team Battle Royale)

Each one of those is extremely fun to play, and the only hope is that developers keep on supporting this game and adding content for the years to come. They already did wonders to this game after taking feedback from the alpha and beta, and I hope that this trend continues.",Recommended,12,1

as a turn-based Worms purist, this was actually a nice change of pace! the fast-paced real-time action this game gives you as well as the really short rounds gets really addictive and makes you wanna keep playing however it's a little laggy for me at least for my end whilst my wifi is fairly strong. i hope the servers get a little better in terms of latency because i do wanna keep playing it. there are some moments where i'm clearly shooting at someone but it doesn't look like it was connecting to an enemy and then i die randomly. please do change that because i wanna love this. and atm, it's hard to win ANY game (especially deathmatch) atm when there are people who have been playing since the beta, of which i didn't, who just crush the new players such as myself. if you can balance the matchmaking and improve the servers, this is definitely a non-conventional Worms game that is fun for both veteran AND beginner fans!",Recommended,8,0

It's a good game that had all the makings of what could have been a great game but it missed it's mark.

Notalgia of playing worms 2? yes!
the chaos and unpredictable wildness of the classic Quake arena? sure it kinda has that.
Various competitive game modes? they put that in there too! (deathmatch, last worm standing, etc.)

It's really a bit of fun to play but there's just one problem... they have to fix the fact that it isn't playable sometimes. If there is no one else online to play, you CAN'T play.

Here's the bottom line on the mixed reviews - their match making system needs work. A lot of work.
- Matches taking between 5-10 minutes (i'm not kidding)
- Deathmatch games having players popping in an out on occasion.
- player ranking lobbies are a lawless wasteland. (imagine jumping in on your first game with 5 level 50 players while you're still trying to get a feel for the game). Not fun.

Now, this is probably because of a loss of players because the devs may have neglected to add certain parts of the worms franchise that made the game fun.

- Setting up private rooms to pick and choose who you play with (friends and/or people in a certain region for instance).
- Offline game modes and challenges for new players to get to enjoy the mechanics the devs worked quite hard to polish.
- A spectator mode where players can watch on-going matches and possibly learn the maps.


I really do like the game... but i don't think i can recommend the game to anyone else I know until they polish up a few things with the game.

Beyond that, the game stands a chance to be one of the great games. Really It does.

The attention to detail they put into it shows with their audio and visual designs. Personally I appreciated small touches like putting a mild echo on the bathroom areas, adding pinball and arcade sounds in the lobby areas, the grapple hook mechanics were really evident.

If the devs ever do get to read this, I hope that they get put more (modes) into it. It honestly feels more like an early access game than anything not because the game isn't good. It feels like an early access game because the game could be so much more than what it is. It HAS so much potential to be one of the greats.",Recommended,11,0

Of the two hours I have played: 36 minutes have been spent in actual matches. The rest has been in queue. 12 matches, with an approximate average wait time of ten minutes to find a match.

Unless the distribution model changes (free to play) there will never be a chance of a large active player-base at this point, and dropping $20 just to stare at the words ""searching"" doesn't seem worth while.

But how surprised I was when, after a few matches played, I was not bored at all, and the dynamics of the matches only benefited the series.

This game is definitely for fans of a series that have been waiting for some kind of evolution. Believe me, it came and it's very good.


Сlassic deathmatch may sound fun at first, but I'm sure after 20-30 matches it will be boring enough.

But I can't say that about battle royale - all of a sudden, it's VERY COOL, despite the fact that I'm a longtime player in pubg and APEX, and I really liked the way the developers implemented it.",Recommended,9,0

I love the old turn based Worms, but this thing is obvious just an attempt to cash in on the recent Battle Royale / Deathmatch craze. Unfortunately there's barely anyone on the servers and the game just isn't fun. It took 10 minutes to find a game and then all you do is run, jump, and shoot, with little strategy or thought.

The game is very dynamic and fun, butthe absence of being able to host Custom Matches makes it virtually impossible to play this. The games require, IIRC, 16-32 players, and the game's average online barely satisfies this requirement, so you're stuck playing with the same players all along. The matches take a while to be found, and they only last about 5-10 minutes, so the wait is really just not worth it.

I would highly recommend to play this after it's gone F2P or after they've added an ability to create and host custom matches with your own rules, like in classic Worms installations.",Recommended,5,0

A fun game like no other, changing the way we play Worms!

Graphics: The graphics are decent with some nice reflections, graphical spark to some explosions or electric but overall, a very decent platform style game.

Audio: All the lovely worms sounds are here from noises, to the awesome 'Holy Hand Grenade' ""ooooo"" noise. It's all bang on.

Controls: Super easy and simple to get used too, nothing hard or confusing, pickup and play.

Game-play and everything else: The game is not turn based which is a nice welcome to the series. It's a side scrolling platform shoot them up with some really good modes, weapons, character customising skins to unlock, levels to earn with weapon levels too. It's really good fun and cross-play makes the matches even better for constant games.

As I write this review, a few days after release. The only issue I have is the lack of maps right now. I am sure this will be fixed further down the line, but right now it's lacking maps.
Yes, the game is really good fun and you can party with people, drag into games so always on the same map etc, it's all very very simple, it's just the maps that I have an issue with but I know, in time it will be fixed.

There are different modes to death-match, last team standing etc but all are fun to play and learn the game. The weapons are all unique and some really fun to use. You jump, dive, roll into pipes, elevators etc. It's all here from the Worms fun and a platform shooter.

Would I recommend the game? 100% yes! It's dirt cheap and a lot of fun with hours to play solo or with friends, it's a game underestimated and fun!",Recommended,5,0

Worms Rumble has blown my expectations out of the water and it is already my new favorite game. It's an intense, real-time deathmatch and battle royale game that has an incredible progression system...

Worms Rumble has blown my expectations out of the water and it is already my new favorite game.

If you have any experience with the Worms Franchise you know that they are mainly these turn-based tactical games and so Worms Rumble is a crazy new take on the Worms formula and it works incredibly well.

Instead of playing like the old Worms Games, Worms Rumble is a super intense, real-time deathmatch and battle royale game that is super fun. Also it is just a breath of fresh air in terms of multiplayer games for me personally.

The battle royale mode is extremely fast paced which is great and the inventory management system is super streamlined.

And I will say the weapons are probably one of the best parts about this game. There are several unique weapons like some classics like the shotgun, assault rifle, and the rocket launcher, but then you have these other crazy weapons like a gun that shoots exploding sheep that run to the enemy, which if you play other Worms game you will definitely recognize.

And the attention to detail on these maps is pretty incredible. The 2.5D artsyle is really awesome and all the different areas are visually different which makes the maps feel like they have a ton of variety. Also there are several different maps with unique gimmicks to them so you don’t have to worry about getting bored on the maps at all.

In terms of the playerbase, the game seems to be doing crazy good right now, its a free game for premium playstation users in December I believe, and the game is cross platform at launch so with all the platforms together I don’t think you will have to worry about getting in games of 32 people.

And so the gameplay is fast paced, exciting, and crazy fun but that’s only half of why I love this game so much.

This game has a progression system that actually managed to make me care. A lot of games do the type of progression system tied to cosmetics and normally they don’t interest me at all but for some reason this game just does it right and makes me love it.

It kind of works like the progression in COD and also kind of Apex Legends in a way. So you can level up your overall account and that unlocks new customizations for your worm like hats, faces, and even card backgrounds and different stat tracking things to brag about on your cards like Apex Legends does.

Also you can level up each individual weapon which will allow you to get new weapon skins for those guns and the final weapon skin is gold which reminds me so much of Call of Duty and I love that because I always liked grinding for gold weapon skins.

So for me pesonally this game is just everything I could ask for in a game. You have crazy good and fast paced gameplay, you have super fun weapons to fight with, you have really good looking maps and just an overall amazing theme, I’ve always loved the worms franchise, and a really simple yet impactful progression system that gets you new cosmetics for your worm and your weapons.

The only piece of criticism or feedback I would give is that there is sometimes a little bit of downtime between the matches. The game takes a little to find a match and then the loading into that match takes a decent amount of time. It’s nothing unbearable but after playing a couple games in a row I started to notice it and if you die instantly in the battle royale mode it might suck to have to go through that whole process again.

But besides that, hands down I would recommend this game in a heartbeat.",Recommended,17,0

Its actually insulting to call this a Worms game. I think I'd rather play with Worms in my garden. It takes away the iconic turn based methodical gameplay and replaces it with a chaotic and way too busy real time combat system with a barely functional server.

There's 3 maps and like 12 weapons but none of them matter because you only need the melee attack which hits so hard and can be abused in the chaotic sessions. Also there's no single player so a game that relies so heavily on MP being this dead is a waste of your money.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
What an absolute gem of a game.

It saddens me that until now people (including myself) were not aware of this games existence. It appeared to completely slip on the radar before trending recently. And it absolutely deserves that overwhelmingly positive score it has.

This game has clearly taken a lot of inspiration from beloved childhood games, such as Henry Stickmin, Simpsons Hit and Run and, at least visually speaking, something like Unturned or Little Big Planet. The graphics are simplistic, but that is not a criticism. They're bright and bouncy and make you feel good. It has that quintessentially British humour, with much of the core of the game revolving around jelly (or jello for our American friends) and jelly-related terms. The music reminds me of Stardew Valley and similar games, and is light-hearted and adorable. A few missions have music that is evocatively similar to other games. For example, the pizza delivery mission plays a song intentionally similar to Spider Man's infamous side-mission, even including the music speeding up. Such detail and references are welcome, wholesome and fill me with joy.

There is actually quite a lot to do in the game. At first it seems to not be the case, but as you expand the map and are made aware of the various island 'worlds' that make it up, then it is actually quite jam packed with content; especially considering the price. There's an assortment of vehicles, houses, pets and places to explore. You can customise your little Wobbly character with a variety of fun outfits. The quests are the perfect balance of relaxed difficulty: easy enough to have fun and also to sit back and not stress too much about it. I generally hate timed quests in games, but this game does them well with enough room for forgiving mistakes and are short and enjoyable enough to eagerly give a second and twentieth go.

The co-op is fantastic. My only criticism is for some reason there is a controller button that allows me to spawn a second character in addition to my own and then splits the screen. The controls then become unplayable as it is attempting to use dual inputs, requiring me to restart. It isn't a major deal, but I hope they fix this very strange bug or feature? I'm unsure. Thankfully joining back into a game with someone is incredibly easy, progress is saved easily, the game loads quickly and is all-around well optimised for cooperative play. Joining missions with your friends is easy and allows you to equally reap the rewards for completing them. I would recommend playing it with friends over solo, as the missions are definitely oriented for multiple people. Not to say solo is not also not wonderfully enjoyable.

The controls you might expect would be terrible, as this is a game akin to Goat Simulator. I think the controls are better. They are actually surprisingly responsive to such a game. The developers have clearly combined just enough physics as to be amusing without eternal frustration of bugging out. There are surprisingly few bugs in this regard. While I have managed to slingshot into the stratosphere a few times, it never broke the game or what I was doing and was instead enjoyably awaited. And for the few times I did clip through something, there is a respawn button, which should be ubiquitous in these games. The vehicles feel responsive but definitely control like much older titles where they are challenging beasts to turn at speed. All of this makes for much hilarity, without much frustration. I honestly cannot believe this game is still in Early Access for the amount of polish it has in most areas.

If you're having a bad day. If this world is seeming just a little too existential, then come to Wobbly Island, buy a house for $1,000 to taste the sweet sugary tones of ownership and firmly attach your stubby gelatinous hands to any passing vehicles.

The Simpsons Hit & Run meets Goat Simulator.

It's lacking a lot of features to keep it interesting, but that's because you're supposed to bring along your friends and build your own fun. The world feels empty and hollow because it lacks NPCs going about their business. There are a few people driving vehicles that you can see from time to time, but nowhere near enough to convince me that this world is truly lived in.
You sadly cannot mix hairstyles with hats, so you could either have a gnome beard or a gnome hat, but never both at once. How am I supposed to fulfil my gnome roleplay fantasies if I can't be bearded with a pointy hat? It's outrageous. I'd also like to see more options for customisation in the future.

I saw my brother play it with my little nephew, and I said why not try it myself. I played this game with low expectations, Especially since it was made for children. From the first time I played it, I saw the amount of content in it from side missions to main missions. The game is incredibly diverse, especially since it is early access. not a complete game. whatever your age You may like the game. The game does not contain boring childish dialogues or very simple tasks. The game is more like real life. It has jobs that you accomplish for money + houses that you buy + you can buy cars + clothes + animals and other things, you will enjoy it, whether alone or with your friends or brothers

-But there are things that I would like to change or be added,
such as changing the snowy area. Every time I go to it, the graphics seem to change from ultra to very low setting.
Add NPCs walking on the sidewalks
Adding more NPCs in the city to make it more lively
Adding more vehicles and making the car showroom sell special cars for the player and not available in cities

LOTS OF FUN, BUT ALSO FRUSTRATION. I HAVE PLAYED MORE THAN 100 HOURS AND I MEAN IT FOR REAL.

My kids love it! The game is really COOL to play CASUALLY in coop (allows local split screen):

- wonderfull, silly, violence-free open world
- many jobs to do and puzzles to solve
- unlockable pets, vehicles and suits
- creative nad memorable moments (feeding the monster, hoverboard ride, getting shrunk in the laboratory etc)
- arcade arena with different games: hide&seek, ""Fall guys""-type running, a sandbox mode, conveyor belt game
- supports modding

But after some time of exploring and just casually hanging around, you want to complete tasks, get artefacts, unlock things and earn money to buy cars/houses. Then the frustration kicks in:

- money bags randomly dissapear
- hard-earned artefacts just noclip through the trunk of your car and get lost
- chests are sometimes spawned under the buildings, or the loot slips in the water
- artefacts and gold get stuck under the floor
- some vehicles are almost uncontrollable (airplanes, water scooter)
- airplanes and helicopters randomly explode
- sometimes jobs cannot be done (job target is so far away you cannot complete the job - furniture delivery, fireman...)
- some platforms bounce you off randomly into the water
- fishing is probably the worst minigame I have played in years
- interesting quests like the police job, the temple or secret laboratory are really scarce, 99.5% of the game are just repetitive jobs
- NPCs are scarce, the world is almost empty
- I have been trying real hours to get the randomly generated artifacts like the uranium crystal from the mine or the golden trinket in the trashcan - but unlucky me, they didnt spawn
- at the moment, there is maybe 1 interesting mod available

I understand that most of these are probably early-access bugs, that they appear randomly and not all the time - but they can ruin your gameplay anyway. Imagine playing with your little buddy, thying for half an hour to get an artefact from a cave - and on your way back your helicopter randomly explodes, your artefact gets lost and the little buddy has tears in his eyes...
On the other hand, if you are playing the game coop with your kids that just want to give silly dress to their character, ride the jelly car and bump into everything in their way, then your money is well-spent.

Hey, I might sound negative, but I like the game and it was worth the money. Get it now :)
PS: I am looking forward for the space update!",Recommended,42,2

I would never play a game like this myself. I tried it just because of my 6-year daughter. And I would never imagine that it become our best game with 140+ hours of gameplay. And I also did not expect that I will enjoy it myself too. To be clear. I would still not play it alone. But I recommend it to play with your kid. There are some aspects that I hate like left traffic, objects disappearing from the world when you move too far from them and I also don't like the visual way how 3D objects simplify in distance, in a very ugly way. I have 4090 RTX with enough memory to turn off simplification completely, but it is not possible. I also don't like selling a house for half price only. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the puzzles, looking for hidden places, scientific lab.

I was looking for a game, that my kids (11 and 7) could safely play together. Let me just say: i succeeded, they absolutely love this game. Its basically GTA for kids, open world, tons of stuff to discover and do, funny visuals, smooth game-play. Its a blast!
-
Now for a request directly from my children:
They would love to be able to do more jobs, expecially a store-owner would be their dream job! Setting up a store and selling goods, maybe without actual costumers, but some kind of algorythm that pours money into the cashier more or less randomly once the store is setup. Would that be a thing in the future?

Thank you again for this wonderful game!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So what happens when you take the ragdoll and grab physics of Human Fall Flat and drop them into a open-world adventure with no real goal except to have fun just flailing about and creating chaos? You get Wobbly Life. I'll admit that I had actually never heard of this game until I saw a certain group of Youtubers fooling around with it and that got me interested in looking at what the game had to offer. When I actually picked it up and played it, it's safe to say I wasn't disappointed.

The open world here is surprisingly-big for what you would tend to expect from a game like this. The game is, so far, split up into a selection of around half a dozen islands, each with their own selection of things to do, jobs to earn money with and unlockables. Want to go to the mine and dig up some ore in exchange for cash in the island up north? Want to go to a disco club on the main island and make some money in a rhythm game? Want to just forego the money and go exploring the nearby tropical island to see if there's any mysteries there you can unlock cool stuff with? You're free to do whatever you want whenever you want it. The only goal you have when you start the game is to afford a place of your own, and after that you're just left to your own devices. This game is super easygoing on how you progress and it actually rewards curious and explorative players with special unlockable goodies like unique vehicles, clothing and pets.

Additionally, I'm surprised at the level of puzzle-solving there is in this game due to it clearly being a game that gamers of all ages can pick up and play. A lot of the things in this game are easy enough to figure out but unlocking some of the special cars, clothing and pets requires a surprising amount of steps with very little hints or clues. I won't give any specific examples here just for the sake of potentially spoiling a cool reward for someone who hasn't unlocked it yet but a couple of unlocks require you to do something while in the process of doing a specific job or in the middle of a timed race. Personally I really like that because the game goes out of the way to reward people who like to explore.

Now, I should also bring this up: This game was very-clearly made with multiplayer in mind. The game is perfectly playable and fun if you're playing on your own but there are a handful of jobs in the game that are a royal pain to do without a couple extra sets of hands helping you. For me, the newspaper and ice cream jobs are especially annoying to try and do on my own and you need to be near-perfect with how you play either of those games if you're solo and still want to pass the jobs. Like I said, I know that the games were made to be fun for more than one player but, since I've only played solo so far, the only thing those jobs have brought me thus far is just headaches.

I definitely recommend this game, especially if you're the type that likes to explore at your own pace or if you're looking for some mindless fun you can have with a few friends. I wasn't expecting the game to be as fun as it is when I picked it up, and I think it exceeded my expectations greatly considering the Youtubers that introduced me to the game didn't actually do much with it now that I see what the game has to offer. Now I'm looking forward to seeing what the devs do next with it and what they do to add to the game when there's already quite a bit to do here.",Recommended,30,0

While looking for games to play with friends (we're all adults) and my partner saw Wobbly Life. At first we were very hesitant, the price seemed a little high for what the trailer implied and we had recently been burned by other early access titles. We figured we would give it a try and if it's horribly broken we'd just refund it. All this preamble to say we went into playing this game with very low expectations and high standards.

We were completely wrong! My friends and I are now approaching the 50 hour mark of the game and we've just about completed all the achievements, trust me when I say that this game seems like a very shallow and simple game but that is hiding a deep exploration driven sandbox that has an unexpected amount of stuff to discover!

I actually thought I left a review for this game already. All you need to know is that this game is a blast with friends, the silliness of everything and the exploration is some of the best bits. I am sad that this doesn't have a dedicated server for tons of people to get together, but the four player is still a blast none the less.

Pros:
-The jobs all are fun and unique in their own right, def. try each one to find your favorite
-The noises and emotes the characters use/make are fun to listen to
-The quests are fun to go through even if simple they are fun
-The game seems to still be adding content to a already fun game
-Lots of clothing options to choose through
-Lots to do, and with the right group could easily reach 60 hours playtime

Cons:
-The parkour is a lot clunky
-There's not a lot of buy-able cars

Overall a great game to play with friends, some people might even enjoy it solo. Look at reviews, maybe check a video or two before going into this. Try to talk your friends into it. Kind of a mix between human fall flat, grand theft auto, and that one reliable delivery game.",Recommended,23,1

So....this game sat in my libary, it was mainly for my little sister because welp as cool as those fast paced violent shooters are i cannot let that lil gremlin play them so she had this but after some time she played her own games, i needed to try this out and IT IS GOOD its a open world sandbox game kinda simmilar to GTA games ( of course without the violence and criminal stuff) and this game proves well that you can make a good open world game without any violence of course this dosent mean this game isn't action packed you do some really really cool stuff. Another point i can give to this game is the fact its non linear so you can explore where and what you want AND DANG THIS GAME HAS A LOT TO EXPLORE. The driving is..okay i like it, and i really need to give credit to people who made this game there's no over the top action and the game is intresting and fun there's an huge amount of content so yeah if you're tired of splattering guts of monsters everywhere with a shotgun this game is perfect for you get some rest will ya? it has a few bugs and all but its a really nice expierence 9/10.",Recommended,21,0

We then made the decision to keep playing, and boy it's a good thing we did! We ended up playing for another 4 hours just finding new secrets and new hidden missions to do.

Wobbly Life

While perusing Steam's upcoming releases in the Co-Op category, I came across this game as it caught my eye. The trailer reminded me of a lot of Human Fall Flat (one of my favorite games) except with childhood innocence. You have a bright and positive world to interact with which also includes many tasks to keep you busy and provides rewards for your character. I quickly wish listed the game and showed a couple of my friends. Then I waited for it's release and was happy to see the price was even generous.

Upon installing and loading up the game, the main menu shows you an overview of your little island and character. The happy music that accompanies the scene (and even throughout the game) puts you in a good mood and even made me smile.

Perks:
- Game is only $8.99 which I think is a pretty good bargain for a new release.
- It will remind some of Human Fall Flat and Total Reliable Delivery Service with the controls favoring a Human Fall Flat approach thankfully.
- It's an open-world sandbox with lots of locations, jobs for your character, mini-games, and even vehicles you can drive.
- You can complete jobs or tasks around the island and earn currency which you can spend on various things including properties and the ability to buy customizable clothes and vehicles.
- The game has both single-player mode and multiplayer modes.
- Online Co-Op is in Beta currently but I'm glad I can play with my friends on it.
- The controls for your player are very simple as well are driving vehicles or carrying objects. Left stick controls your left arm, right stick controls your right, and X even makes your player fall over all of which are just like Human Fall Flat.
- Arcade is coming soon which I assume is mini-game related.


I haven't put a lot of time into this game yet but can already tell I'm glad I bought it. I had my assumptions before it's release and it hasn't been disappointing yet. I think this game has a lot of potential going forward and considering it was made by such a small development team is impressive. I'm expecting a lot of quality updates in the future and interested in how they go about adding more content.

I would definitely recommend this game as I feel it's worth a try. Looking forward to having fun with my friends on it accompanied by a lot of laughs.",Recommended,22,1

Imagine if someone took Human Fall Flat, Simpsons Hit and Run, and Stick RPG and loosely stuck them together. This is that strange mixture. There's not loads to do but there are a few interesting puzzles and mechanics. Hopefully the devs keep adding stuff in, there's an okay level of customisation but i would like to see a bit more life in the game and more than 4 players in a multiplayer game",Recommended,27,0

i'm nearly 22 years old and i'm addicted to this game and i'm not even quite sure why. i don't usually play it with friends or anything but i'll spend hours and hours just running around climbing on stuff and goofing off. it's just a nice thing to do with my hands while talking to friends in voice calls.
that being said it's very fun with friends and siblings! it's brought me a lot of laughs and i highly recommend it.",Recommended,27,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
You know, this isn't a bad game! I don't hate it. What a weird way to start things off though, right? It oozes with character! There's just one little issue I have with it. One teeny-tiny itsy-bitsy issue.

This game almost made my wife puke.

Upon a moment of reflection, that's actually a huge issue.

This game makes some people insanely motion sick, and there's very little you can do about it. If you get motion sickness from games, you really should do a hard pass on this one.

Now, if you don't get motion sickness... I don't know, the best comparison I have is GTA Online, with only your friends, and no crimes. Also wobbly.

If that doesn't mean anything to you, this is your jam: You'll roam around a game map, Grand Theft Auto style, finding jobs to do, and doing those jobs in the form of various minigames. There's a lot of jobs. All of them pay you as long as you meet some of the job objectives, but better success gets you better payouts. That money can be used to buy one or more houses in the game world. Or clothes. Or cars.

Not that you just can't ""borrow"" a car as it drives by. Or find one parked in somebody's yard and make do with that. I mean, wait, you can. You totally CAN do that.

What separates this from GTA, well, obviously the lack of crime. And obviously the art style. But this game leans on ragdoll hijinks and clumsy character physics. Your mouse buttons extend each arm. With arm extended, whatever you touch you ""grab"" until you release the mouse. This is how you press buttons, pick up items in the game world, or grip the rear bumper of a car and consent to getting dragged around by your coop partner.

And yes, coop. So you can roam around being a goof.

And much like GTA's game world, most of it is coop, and there's a lot of secrets hidden about, so you don't have to helicopter-rescue injured people or make hamburgers, you can just meander and see what's to be seen.

So despite the fact that the missus is out, I'll probably poke at this a little more yet. I wanted to get that chalet in the mountains. It looked nice. And then I'll move on to other things.

It's not a deep game, it's a very willfully shallow and absurd game, but clearly it's a work of passion by its developers. I respect that more than mere words can express. I just wish it didn't make my wife puke.

We stopped playing this online, and moved on to other things to stream. That streaming happens at . I put this on the bottom on purpose, because people who read all this are exactly my kind of people. I'm chatty. Say hello.",Recommended,27,4

Genuinely one of the best open world experiences on steam right now that i can think of, i dont think ive seen any game quite like this that gives true free reign to explore while having so much to discover, ive played for 11 hours and im still discovering stuff that was technically there the whole time that i never noticed

The world actually feels alive which is what i think a lot of open world games struggle with but, a surprising majority of the set pieces are interactable where youd expect them to be static backdrops in other games. for example, a simple music store would most likely be an decal over a geometric prop, in this game you can go inside and play with the instruments and talk to the guy running the store, even though you cant buy the instruments

Several little things like this are scattered through the game not to mention the actual hidden side quests that end up being much more in depth than I would assume at the beginning, this all isnt even to mention the many jobs that are available to earn money to buy random stuff, theres so much going on its genuinely difficult to give a concise review but i highly recommend this game, i havent even checked out the arcade or multiplayer yet but its still a great time just exploring finding unique things in every corner",Recommended,25,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Wobbly Life is such a neat game, it's basically an open-world version of Human Fall Flat crossed with Surgeon Simulator were the controls in that title actually sensible. This game is challenging and not ragequit-inducing, which is a nice switch. If you fail a job it's not really a big deal, but maybe there's another way to approach it that'll guarantee success next time.

The majority of Wobbly Life can be played solo if you wish, but some job types such as flipping burgers at this time essentially need two or more players. Certain hidden objectives also benefit greatly from having a crew of friends. Note while this supports drop-in multiplayer the random players I've encountered have ALL been griefers looking to steal your cash or destroy your vehicle for no reason. A mention also needs to be made that some missions vary between online and off, hospital work with others involves a medevac chopper while playing solo sees you pulling ambulance duty.

There is quite a bit of content here for around $10, but those of you achievement hunters seeking to 100% Wobbly Life should note you'll be doing a ton of grinding for around 40 to 50 hours to do so. While there are varied careers there is a somewhat limited number of each task so you'll see repeated jobs quickly.

I'm honestly surprised word of mouth hasn't exploded this title yet as it's really accessible, but with a steady stream of updates since initial Early Access release and developers regularly appearing on the hub I'm assuming this will happen at some point. Easy recommend, that I can't quit playing it says it all.",Recommended,17,0

It's as if Grand Theft Auto and Human Fall Flat had a baby.

- One of the best CO-OP party games to play with another friend.

- A pretty b*tchin' soundtrack.

- A visually appealing artstyle with simplistic but eye-candy graphics.

- Simple but extremely fun and addicting gameplay mechanics.

- You're gonna be laughing your ass off constantly depending on how you play this game in CO-OP. It's best played with 1 or 2 more people with voice chat as well. Playing in Single Player is significantly less fun and duller.

- A big open world to explore, filled with collectables and jobs that you can complete to earn money. Money is spent to further customize your character and purchase goods which further aid you in the open world.

- Physics-Based chaos throughout your playtime.

- CO-OP play is encouraged and rewarded by allowing your buddy to help you during certain jobs, allowing you to complete it significantly quicker. You can also get creative, think outside of the box and complete specific jobs in new ways that you cannot do in Single Player.

My husband and I have finished a lot of the content in this game and let me tell you, for the price, we were both pleasantly surprised!! It's SO MUCH MORE than it looks in the trailers/photos! Just an all-around great time. Lots of ways to mess around in the world (which is surprisingly large), lots of places to explore, puzzles to solve, etc. I will say, the enjoyment you get from this will mostly be from mini-games and collectibles. There's lots of ways to just muck about in the world and cause chaos, but that's not the bread and butter. But, regardless of your preference, I HIGHLY recommend you try it! With a friend!!

Early Access v0.7.6 review

Man, trust me, your kid ages 5-12 has a pretty good chance of getting your money's worth out of Wobbly Life in playtime or awe. And that's my review for Wobbly Life.

No, but, really, this is a charming game. It's a little rough around the edges and budget indie jank but (surprisingly not too bad) it's a whole lot of fun especially for the bargain price. Things that could improve the game would be: more of an economy (right now everything roughly costs the same), tighter controls, remove the rare but present possibilities of getting stuck, better and less awkward handling of vehicles, more items to spend your money on with purpose. (Rather than just houses and props.)

Still, I'm way out of the age bracket to be playing this game and I still am having a really good time. There's no violence, death, explosions, injury, anything bad. Sometimes it's relaxing to go back to that era and with most of the mini-games being mild to moderate difficulty hand-eye coordination of your standard console fair, it's perfectly low stress and really open to all audiences.

I almost considered if I'd made the right purchase or not until I spent some time reflecting on the fact that the game is nice in that it doesn't push me toward any goals, I can complete it at my leisure, it's quite pleasing to look at and I have fun trying new things in the huge landscape to explore. There's no pressure and I can set it down and pick it back up at my leisure. I found a few interesting things to do as well, such as join a disco or a quiz show. The mini-games have variety.

This game is inevitably more fun with partners. You can find a few easter egg items in the world that will allow you to have more fun with more people, such as a tractor-drawn tomato gun in a barn. In the online mode, up to four players can play together in a drop-in drop-out non-persistent game world. For that reason, it reminds one of another popular game series on a smaller scale. It's basically a GTA free roam clone for all ages and fun for the whole family.

If you want a more polished game, wait for the price to be increased (as stated by the developers) and for it to leave Early Access and for the bugs to be hammered out. But in the meantime, it is a cheap and harmless way to spend a few hours grinding money, taking in the cute scenery and nice experiences.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Update: Added more stuff in review as i played more of the game
Update2: They addressed the issue i had with the metal detector and i'm so happy they did! now the only thing they need to address is the UFO signals and i think this game is good so far with deaf or hard hearing people! Also added info on Steam Deck support and how well it works on it.

This is a really nice game that i wasn't expecting to enjoy as much as i do.
In this game you play as a thing called ""Wobbly"" and you do a bunch of activites to earn money to be able to buy a house, car, props, pets and all sorts of things.

Initially when i bought this i thought this game will be nothing but you doing jobs and driving around but it turns out this game has MUCH MORE to offer like finding artifacts for the museum, Finding parts to unlock a vehicle, Solve puzzles, collect presents for cash and clothes, treasure hunting and much more!

Character controls relatively nicely, you use mouse buttons or triggers on controller for each arm to grab things or hold unto things like cars. Multiplayer however has some movement delay which i hope is gonna be fixed.

Physics are surprisingly stable although there are sometimes moments where the prop/object would get stuck. One example being that the seashell artifact found in jungle could get stuck in a jeep in between the seats. Sometimes when crashing into something the props inside the van would just suddenly disappear, but i'm sure those are things that could be fixed as the game develops because so far the physics are relatively good, especially for multiplayer!

Speaking of multiplayer i wish there was some sort of text chat. I can understand why there isn't text chat as the game is played by kids but i wish that at least the friends only servers could have an option to chat as i have a deaf friend and the only way to communicate with him is via text so i have to resort to using Steam's chat instead. The game offers an emote wheel for some kind of communication but i wish it had more options like ""Thanks"", ""Sorry"" and yes and no option and perhaps an ability to sit down.

Speaking of Deaf people, initially when i wrote this review i talked about how the metal detector didn't had visual clarity but in update 0.7.6 they added visual clarity to the metal detector! But there still is a problem and it's with the quest to get the UFO Signals from telescopes as those require you to listen in to know how many times it beeped. A visual clarity like a ""growing ring that fades at the end"" effect around the UFO to show that it beeped would be good. Very happy that the devs addressed this issue!

The jobs in the game are fun to do and are sort of like a minigame. The one Job i have the most problems with is the Ice Cream Factory one and it mainly has to do with physics and colorblindness. The physics are sometimes difficult in this one as the things in the cone fall off easily. maybe a longer timer would be better for this one cos of how careful you have to be to make things inside the cone not fall off. Regarding the colorblindness thing, i have sometimes hard time seeing what color is of the sauce cos the color is too similar to each other for me. The fishing job is fun but i feel like the fishing spot shouldn't be too far away as it takes so long to get there, perhaps faster boats maybe? I also wish however there was a easier way to quit the job, like in the ""pause"" menu there could be a button to quit a job instead of having to walk to the wobbly or have to intentionally fail the job.

The game is filled with a bunch of props to play with and i really like how interactive everything is. I like that there are also some Wobblys driving a car to show the world is lively and populated. also a lot of the wobbly NPCs have something to say which is cool. The world itself is fun to explore as sometimes the game rewards you with presents for exploring certain areas of the game. Also i wish there was some way of storing props, or eating the food items.

The vehicles are also nice too. I wish however that the big helicopter had a button to close the door as transporting things with it can be a little challenging cos things can fall off from it. I like the camping van and how you can enter inside, same with the bus too. I wish the vehicle shop had more vehicles to offer like the hovercraft cos i like that one the most cos it can go on water at a good speed and can strafe.

Overall i really like this game and i can't wait to see more updates added to this. This is a really fun game that i can imagine fun playing with a younger brother. Hopefully this comes to more platforms than Steam and Xbox, perhaps even with crossplay.

-- STEAM DECK section of the review --
It works well on Steam Deck althought it can have performance hiccups when being around the city. Game ran at 60fps with TDP turned down to 10. Controller support works out of the box HOWEVER i wish there was an option to set sensitivity of the mouse and controller separately as i found myself often switching it up and down every time i switched devices. Either have 2 sliders for both mouse and controller stick or just don't make it sync via Cloud Saves.",Recommended,16,0

Though I've only played for a couple of hrs on this account I have been playing Wobbly Life on another account for over a year. It's now one of my favourite games of all time. The graphics are really simple, but v cute. But the gameplay is amazing. i love exploring and completing the many missions, especially in splitscreen multiplayer is so much fun. I really, really, really recommend this game. My only complaint is that updates aren't very often and sometimes only include a few new character outfits. I've been waiting ages for new missions and areas to explore because once you've done all the missions there isn't a lot else left to do. /still one of my favourite games ever though.",Recommended,19,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For it's single player I can recommend the game, as for the multiplayer I simply cannot in it's current state. I bought this game to play with my fiance but it completely unplayable no matter who the host is. Our internet is good and we live under the same roof so we should have no issues as we play other more demanding games with no issues that run under P2P (peer to peer) connections, after doing research on Reddit and Wobbly Life's Discord I found the problem lies in how the developers handle lag (which is adding a internal delay to your input in multiplayer to prevent stutters) but all this does is create massive delays in your input i'm talking +5 seconds and if it gets really out of hand you can see yourself stuck floating somewhere while the host sees you running off into the middle of nowhere and then you finally catchup after two minutes. This type of delay is unplayable because most of the ""jobs"" in Wobbly Life require you to use your reflexes and you physically cannot do that with an input delay.

I really hate having to give a game like this a negative review, I can see it's potential and I can see it's charm but as it stands this is a as I've read numerous discussions of people falling into the same problem as myself and the developers have acknowledged this issue but it seems they refuse to look further or for a solution (I'm certain a dedicated server would fix this but they don't support that currently)",Not Recommended,27,13

This game is amazingly fun to chill in and roam around with friends. I have a young kid and this game is perfect to do couch co-op with. There is no combat- just open world wobbly sandbox fun. The best way I can describe this game is its Simpsons Hit and Run / Human Fall Flat and Grand Theft auto put in a blender and for kids.

Fantastic game to play with your kids from the couch.
Fun for adults and kids of all ages.
My wife loved it so much, she got her own copy for her own Steam account so she could play on her own in addition to playing with the rest of us.
Biggest limitations are probably:
- The 4 player maximum, which is fine for split screen anyway, since more than that would be difficult on a single screen.
- No modding yet. (This would be a very fun game to mod for.)

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is probably the best family friendly experience you'll find on Earth that won't ruin your relationship with them (ahem Mario Kart Wii).

There is so much to do and so much to explore, so many secrets that it made me almost throw up. It is a very fun physics based open world adventure and I am all for it. Although it does have some flaws, for example the Newspaper Job being almost impossible doing it solo and that there is just waaaaay too many collectibles. If I would do something about the Newspaper Job I would make it pay you for as many newspapers as you deliver rather than when you deliver all of the newspapers, which makes the current newspaper almost impossible to complete.

The game is still in Early Access and it is bound to change, but in its current state I would consider it a very enjoyable experience and I am looking forward for more wobbly life updates, the developers truly have something cute and cozy on their hands.",Recommended,9,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
*DE unten

Quasi my Lego island 3 of dreams ^^

It looked like a game from my childhood, which I had searched up and down on my ME computer back then. I also played the second part very much and enjoyed it. We're talking about Lego Island. I've been waiting for a third part for almost 20 years, but it hasn't come until today... And this game not only looks like Lego Island, but theoretically it is. Wobbly Life acts like a spiritual successor. I don't know if this is coincidence or intentional, but it doesn't matter either. All that is missing is building your own vehicles. But otherwise nothing is really missing, because even the pizza job is included.

There is so much to discover in this game. Even if the game world is not one of the largest maps in video game history, there is more to see and experience than in a world from e.g. Ubisoft or other major game developers. There is something interesting to explore around every corner. In the city it's the shops and houses, in the jungle there are mysterious caves. Each exploration is rewarded with gifts and unlocks new clothes or pets or companions.

The movement and appearance of the characters are reminiscent of Human Fall Flat, but the controls aren't nearly as complex. The three of us were looking for it yesterday for almost 8 hours in one go... and really had a lot of fun. And even though the game has a child-like look, adults can also enjoy this game. Especially if you are one of the Lego Island fans. There is a lot of love in this game, and you can feel it as a player from the very first moment. This game perfectly shows how Indian titles can be better than the Triple A productions that are all about MONEY.

Wishes for the future:
- a German translation
- even more exciting places to explore
- Revision of the somewhat spongy controls
- Being able to rename pets afterwards (at any time).
- Being able to design and build your own vehicles
- Being able to set up your own home independently
- Be able to sell fish more easily and quickly

PS: Many thanks to BigWaross, he gave me the game.


Es sah aus wie ein Spiel aus meiner Kindheit, welches ich damals auf meinem ME Rechner rauf und runter gesuchtet hatte. Auch den zweiten Teil habe ich sehr viel und gerne gespielt. Die rede ist von Lego Insel. Ich warte seid fast 20 Jahren auf einen dritten Teil, der aber bis heute nicht gekommen ist...Und dieses Spiel, sieht nicht nur aus wie Lego Insel, sondern ist es theoretisch auch. Wobbly Life wirkt wie ein geistiger Nachfolger. Ob dies Zufall ist oder beabsichtigtet weiß ich nicht, aber das spielt auch keine Rolle. Alles was fehlt ist das Bauen von eigenen Fahrzeugen. Aber ansonsten fehlt eigentlich nichts, denn selbst der Pizza-Job ist drin.

In diesem Spiel gibt es total viel zu entdecken. Auch wenn die Spielwelt nicht zu grössten Maps der Videospielgeschichte gehört, gibt es mehr zu sehen und zu erleben als in einer Welt von z.B Ubisoft oder anderen großen Spielentwicklern. An jeder Ecke gibt es etwas interessanten zum erkunden. In der Stadt sind es die Geschäfte und Wohnhäuser, im Dschungel geheimnisvolle Hölen. Jede Erkunden wird belohnt mit Geschenken und Freischaltungen neuer Kleidung oder Haustiere bzw. Begleitern.

Die Bewegung und das äußerliche der Figuren erinnern an Human Fall Flat, nur ist die Steuerung ist bei weitem nicht so komplex. Wir haben es gestern fast 8h an einem Stück zu dritt gesuchtet...und hatten wirklich viel Spaß. Und auch wenn das Spiel einen Kindlichen Look hat, können auch Erwachsene sich an diesem Spiel erfreuen. Erst recht wenn du einer der Lego Insel Fans bist. In diesem Spiel steckt sehr viel Liebe drin, und das Spürt man als Spieler vom ersten Moment an. Dieses Spiel zeigt perfekt, wieso Indi Titel besser sein können als die Tripple A Produktionen, bei denen es nur ums GELD geht.

Wünsche für die Zukunft:
- eine deutsche Übersetzung
- noch mehr spannende Orte zum erkunden
- Überarbeitung der etwas schwammigen Steuerung
- Pets nachträglich ( zu jederzeit ) umbenennen zu können
- Eigene Fahrzeuge entwerfen und bauen zu können
- Eigenheime selbstständig einrichten zu können
- Fische leichter und schneller verkaufen zu können

PS: Vielen Dank an BigWaross, er hat mir das Spiel geschenkt.

I think everyone who is displeased about the offline play has a right to air their grievances. All the negative reviews had me quite concerned about whether I should buy the game. However, I'm glad I did and the game deserves a lot of credit. It does almost everything right. I was able to play local co-op with my daughter with no issues. The gameplay is smooth, fun, sound and graphics are quite good and so far I've been very impressed with map variety. AI is at least as good as Gang Beasts. I'm glad I decided to buy, and for me the lack of offline play and the microtransactions are non issues and it does not effect my experience. I don't plan on paying for microtransactions (unless they release a frog, then I might drop some cash). I've only played custom games with local co-op and have had no issues with lag. As a fan of Gang Beasts, Boomerang-fu, Stick Fight the Game, Rounds, A Gummy Life - I can recommend this game.",Recommended,319,18

Dev's promoted this game as including the ability to play online as well as offline with friends.
They then released the game with online-only, blamed their user base for taking their own Steam page description at face-value, then doubled-down saying they never intended and will not provide an offline mode.

The Dev's lack of taking responsibility and instead blaming the community doesn't sit right with me, which is the primary reason I refunded the game.

An absolutely amazing party game providing hours of fun for anyone, with some toxicity (propelled by the game itself) and basically zero offline support.

The good

I think Party Animals is an immensely fun game, I really enjoy playing it, especially with friends in custom games. Custom games have support for bots (with three difficulty levels), making games with even 2-3 human players fun and chaotic. There's a lot of variety through maps and the newly introduced Smash and Mario Kart-esque Nemo Kart game modes. The game supports local split-screen play, albeit it's a bit limited, see below. While there are micro-transactions, they are cosmetic-only, and the game allows you to earn some of its premium currency, too, through level ups and achievements, which I think is a very nice addition - I have been able to buy skins that cost premium currency only by playing the game.

There is also a ""friend pass"", which lets anyone download the game for free, and play with you when you invite them, basically giving you two copies of the game for the price of one. They can do the tutorial on their own and then join a game you invite them to, and even progress.


As for the negatives, which will be much longer, but not because I think the game is bad. I'm hoping that my review will not only help those looking at buying this game, but also the developers.

1. , for which it has been criticized heavily. My biggest gripe with it is that even a supposedly local game in custom match mode, where I'm the only player, is still running through the internet: if my connection is shaky, my character will lag. We played with friends in split-screen through Wi-Fi in a custom game with bots, and it was unplayable. This can be a serious gripe for those looking for offline fun: you cannot play this game without a stable internet connection, not even custom games, where you cannot complete weekly quests (though you earn XP). I wish the developers leaned a bit more into making at least custom games offline-accessible, even if there was no progression while the game is offline. Also, you create a separate profile (account) in the game, which is a bit weird. Deep Rock Galactic did this much better with all data being in your save files (and thus tied to your Steam account), though that game has less micro-transactions and is also not competitive in any way.

2. . It works, but not in every game mode, and it's a bit basic. For example, the months-old Smash and Nemo Kart game modes (at the time of writing) still cannot be played in split-screen. The game simply tells you that you cannot do that with local players. Second, since most maps are relatively small, it would make sense to do some dynamic split screen or even play on one big screen, but you are limited to always being split. This is a bit disadvantageous, as the screen is split horizontally in the middle (the two screens are next to each other), severely limiting horizontal view, which is essential to get a grasp of the (usually quite chaotic) situation around you (you don't look much up and down, but you do have to look left and right a lot). This is only an issue with 2 players, as with 3 or 4, you have your regular screen aspect ratio for your view. Playing with friends on a large screen works, though.

3. . I am happy that voice chat can be turned off as-is (I did so when first booting up the game), which from today, requires a verified phone number to use anyway. I wish we could disable text chat, too, or at least limit it to team only. While the occasional emote spamming and ""ez"" text chats aren't too common (luckily I encounter these in about less than 1 of 5 matches), I think the developers could greatly reduce the remaining toxicity by removing quests that require you to win games - especially since these quests are usually the ones that give you ""regular"" currency, and this is the only way to earn it besides progression. The other quests (""play X games as an animal that can dive"" and such) are really creative, and if only these were left in, I'm sure it would ease the tension. It's a bit easy to get hooked and focus on just winning the game, and I think it's partly due to the quests that are tied to victory.

4. . The game is frequently updated, but patch logs are often not supplied with the updates. We've had one when the Nemo Kart game mode was introduced, for example, but for smaller changes, we usually don't get any. I've just found out that the previously Last Stand (4 teams of 2 players) ""Ice breaker"" map was changed to play out with 2 teams of 4 players, but I've never seen a patch log mentioning this.


Buy this game if you're into party games and have at least one friend. Solo, and become toxic in quick matches. Great game, lots of cute animals (skins), fun, sometimes quirky physics-based mechanics and smooth gameplay.",Recommended,120,0

You must be curious why this game has so many negative reviews in Chinese.
For English speakers:
If you know what this game has done in China, you will know why Chinese players give so many negative reviews to a game produced by a Chinese studio.
They had released a demo three years ago, when the epidemic was in lockdown and everyone was at home with nothing to do. If they had released the game then, it would have been a monumental achievement in the history of gaming, probably on par with 2016's Overwatch. But they didn't, insisting that the game needed more processing, which took almost four years. The pandemic is over, and naturally people don’t have time to play party games.
This is actually not the point. I just want to complain a bit as a player who has waited for so long.
The real point begins here.
Before the game was finally released, the producers made it clear in interviews that their nitpicks resulted in the game being too expensive to run, and they were not shy about making it clear that they were prepared to make players pay for the company's operational missteps. However, there doesn’t seem to be much problem with the price in Europe or the United States?
We all know that games on Steam are priced differently in different countries, which usually depends on economic conditions and exchange rates. The same type of party games are often priced as much in China as in the United States, while Party Animals are almost the price as in the United States. To refer back to the previous paragraph,
even though this is a Chinese studio. Their attitude towards Chinese players is ignorance and arrogance.
After almost four years of work, what's the difference between a game and a demo? I don't know how many of you have played that demo, but the answer is, except for some paid skins and raffle boxes.
In addition, in China, the in-game currency was officially designated as ""ni mo bi"". If translated into English, it would be, "" "", just read it out.
Yes, this has nothing to do with any non-Chinese people. I just want to show that our anger is not unfounded.
How ironic! But if you still can’t understand the reason for so many bad reviews based on Chinese, then I can only wish you good luck.",Recommended,738,0

Huh.

I've waited. A good long while for this game to come out. Played the beta in 2020. Immediately fell in love with the style and a new game to the party brawlers. Waited patiently for 3 more years. Missed the first playtest. Played the next 2, and let me tell you. This game is a mixed bag. I like the game at its core, but everything else is muddied and I dont know how to feel about it. Let me explain.
What I liked
The gameplay. Its fun! It's a TON of fun. Its Gang Beasts meets Fall Guys. Its fun and easy to get into. Theres a lot of powerful items and moves, but the randomness in the physics and the large amount of players. Means theres still a pretty low skill ceiling and approachable to everyone.

The style! Its so cute. Its a very pretty game and the fluffy animals beating the absolute piss out of each others is a fun spectacle.

The maps! While I havent played much of the new maps. The maps that were in the beta. Were fun, unique, had a neat gimmick to them. Theyre well designed and fun to fight in.
Unfortunately that's where my positives end and my gripes begin.














Funnily enough. I enjoy the game. Its fun! Its Fall Guys meets Gang Beasts. The beat em up style gameplay is just fun and chaotic. I will be playing the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game and I would recommend off the gameplay alone, but with the current issues. I wont at the moment. If you got this far and still decide to get it. All I ask is that you dont support them in their shop. Not until the game is in a better spot and the issues everyone has are addressed.

Thanks for reading!


All my points still stand. Including the leave penalty. The point I forgot to convey was that the game still punishes you. Well before the game starts. So if you see it about to get voted. You just cannot leave w/o punishing. Even tho the game hasnt started and theres still a full minute waiting period that your characters are in a locker room. That should be more than enough time to safely leave a game you dont want to play. That goes for any game mode not just the sports modes. I agree with keeping it after the game has started, but its not needed before.

After seeing this review got a lot of traction, and a lot of comments clearly missing the point that a review is completely subjective in their thoughts on it. My problems with it can and will be different than yours. I am fully understanding of the positive reviews and I do agree with them to an extent, but just because I enjoy the game doesn't mean I have to recommend the game.",Not Recommended,643,137

My negative review doesn't fully display the picture, I'd love to be able to give this game a positive review to but don't think I can yet.
If you don't want to read the whole pros-cons list / essay, skip to the summary at the bottom.

Pros:
- Easy to find a game, never had to wait more than 2 minutes at any time.

- Super fun with friends, it's a better, bigger version of gang beasts.

- Good variety of maps. modes & weapons to make things interesting.

- Characters are cute and charming, the IP colabs are really well done.

- Lots of replay-ability, this has become my groups ""go-to"" game for the past week.

- Matches are quick and easy to drop in & out.

- Overall great party game.

- No OCE/Aus or South America server, this makes the game very difficult to play with a ping of 160+ at least. If you're in this region you'll often find yourself starting match knocked out and all the other cons that come with playing on 180 ping.

- If you have a party of 3 we've found that it likes to consistently pair the same people up no matter who the party leader is or join order, it often leaves that third person the odd one out.

- Without frequent updates adding new maps, modes & weapons this game will probably not have much longevity, after 19 hours the magic is slowly starting to wear off.

- don't really need to explain much more on this but after spending $30 on the game finding out skins you want are locked behind the combo of a store & mystery crates (in the form of eggs), leaves a little bit of a sour taste in your mouth, feels a lot like it's going to be made free-to-play at some stage.

- Overall toxicity, there's little censorship in the game, people can name themselves a variety of slurs without problem, but words like & are censored?

- No offline play, huge issue for a lot of people and the way they addressed it seemed quite disingenuous.


The game has the building blocks to set it up to be amazing, it unfortunately falls short at the moment but it's nothing it can't fix.
The introduction of new servers, offline play, map & modes and removal of monetisation are all things that could be added or fixed in future updates.

you're someone who's on the fence about buying the game or your friends are trying to gaslight you into getting it even though you think you won't enjoy it, I'd say your best bet would be to wait a month or so and keep an eye on the updates & see if the reviews take an upturn.

you have the disposable income, friends live somewhere there's a server & this won't stop you from buying another game this month, go for it. It's a super fun game best enjoyed with other people not focusing on being competitive I guarantee you'll have a good time.",Not Recommended,146,5

Party Animals is one of my most played games in my library and I continue to enjoy it on every revisit. But the more I play it, the more I see that it's difficult to recommend to newcomers. On the surface you can imagine that it's a casual party game with cute animals punching each other; however, this is deeply contrasted by the extremely competitive nature of the in-game community. Players who have previous experience with similar physics-based games, such as Gang Beasts or Human Fall Flat, should have a knack for Party Animals and it'd be an easy recommendation. But players with no prior experience should carefully consider if this game is right for them. The following sections of this review will elaborate on my complicated love and hate story with Party Animals.




The fighting controls are more complex than Gang Beasts' and random weapons spawn on the arena to spice up each round. There are several modes to play such as Last Stand (2v2v2v2 or 4v4), Team Score (4v4), and Cabin (for casual off-brand Uno games). The combat is very rewarding once you get a proper handle on it. Exp earned unlocks unique rewards up to level 100, and the achievements also unlock costumes and currency. Players who invest enough time into Party Animals can get around the gacha and game currency limits by gaining experience past level 100 to earn daily mystery boxes containing cookies, Nemo bucks, or lottery coins. I never had a hard time buying the costumes I like in the game's shop because I've earned and saved plenty of currency.

The majority of my hours was spent in solo play but I had more fun whenever I was in a party with friends. Team work is at the heart of each game mode and it's very fun to embrace it with like-minded players. My favorite map of all time is Fluffy Redemption. The respawns are unlimited and there's room for mistakes. I like to switch my roles whenever needed, I could be placing coals into the firebox for a few minutes, attack the opposite team's train to slow them down, and then go back to my train to defend it.

I love the animal and environment physics! Animals can be tossed out of the arena with the right momentum and movement. Each Last Stand map has a hazard that gets deadlier as time passes. Castleween is notable for its random environment destruction. I also enjoy how it's possible to knock out animals with random stuff such as lamps, fishes, and hats. There's no shortage of crazy stuff that can happen in Party Animals. The replayability is practically infinite.




The initial two hours played on Party Animals may not be enough time to determine if the game is right for some players. In my case, I had a blast during my first 100 hours even while I was solo queuing for matches. But I'm sure newcomers will be frustrated once they encounter the tryhards and toxics in the community.

The matchmaking in Party Animals is split into 2 categories: Quick Match and Custom Games. Custom Games offers limited exp gained daily, and Quick Match allows you to level up indefinitely to level 100 + 3 daily mystery boxes. Custom Games are filled with AI bots and it's not obvious which ones have human players. Quick Match is a very simplified system with no variety of options. You can't select Last Stand or Team Score as the mode you'd prefer to join, and you can't opt to join a queue filled with other solo queue'd players. Instead, Quick Match will join together solo queue'd players with coordinated players in a party, and they'll have to vote on a Last Stand or Team Score map. This creates an environment that throws newcomers into a trial by fire. I've read other players' reviews on Party Animals and I can definitely see where they're coming from: the game turns into a waiting simulator after being eliminated quickly in Last Stand. I find that Team Score modes are more casual than Last Stand, and it'd be a great boon for newcomers if there was a ""Quick Match - Team Score"" option.

Quick Match is also the only practical way to earn rewards + exp. Winning will award a lot of exp towards a level up, and losing will award very minimal exp regardless of how well you've played. And many of the achievements require amazing feats in Quick Match. Here's an example: ""666 - In Buzz Ball, single-handedly accumulate all points for your team and win (Quick Match)."" These tryhard achievements contrast the intended spirit of a casual party game. All in all, players are encouraged to play competitively to extremes if they want to earn currency or unique costumes. It's no surprise that there're so many tryhards and toxics, not to the mention the AFK players who farm exp.










There's a lot to love about Party Animals, but there's also a lot to hate about it. I keep returning to Party Animals because I love physics-based games and platformers. I think the good outweighs the bad, despite having many complaints. Newcomers, on the other hand, should beware of the Quick Matchmaking and the community's git gud attitude. Party Animals' learning curve is pretty high but will reward those who are willing to overcome it. My final rating for the game: 9/10. My rating for the in-game community: 6/10.",Recommended,60,0

A great party game for people who don't throw great parties.


Things to help improve your experience:

1. Accept that you are not in control of your character, the magic 8-ball Party Animals uses as a physics engine is.
1.1. You may go flying across the arena at a moment's notice. Why? Don't ask, just accept it.
1.2. You are able to climb back into most arenas using the jump and hold buttons together, but that's only the case until the game decides you're not.

2. Turn the the music volume aaaaaaalllll the way down. Congratulations, the Ice Breaker stage is now bearable.

Inviting friends to your party is as easy as a digesting a chicken steak tartare. Recreate Games has decided to make Steam's social system redundant by creating their own. You'll have to set up your profile, collect your account ID and then pass them to your friends rather than just inviting them directly through Steam.

There is no offline mode despite the game advertising one. As it turns out, this is a huge deal for some people. Keep this in mind if you're looking to buy Party Animals.

Microphone chat is ON by default.

The game is intended to be played using a controller.

No one gets to use Moonmoon but me. It's mine. Pick something else.

Recreate has decided to punish people who choose to leave the game by giving them a Quick Match ban (as if this game is a serious esport), but don't do anything about people who will stay AFK in a match for prolonged periods of time. It takes a really long time for you to get kicked for being idle and replaced with an AI. If you get unlucky enough to be matched with an AFK teammate, will be the one punished if you leave, your teammate might be able to stay idle for long enough to collect the experience at the end of a match. Thanks Recreate, very cool.


Ultimately, there is a lot to enjoy here if you have the patience to put up with all of the bugs in the game's physics. Your character will never quite do what you're telling it to do and this will get you eliminated more often than not, which can be frustrating if you're particularly competitive.
The sound design is nice, the soundtrack absolutely is not.
The graphics are cute and highly stylised, but can already seem quite dated if you notice the weird pixel edges around fur and some objects. Other than that the graphics look great.",Recommended,69,1

No offline mode.

I am seriously tired of games advertised as having singleplayer and local coop not being playable offline because they need to sell their microtransactions. I was excited for this game but now I couldn't care less.

Literally false advertising:

""Fight your friends as puppies, kittens and other fuzzy creatures in PARTY ANIMALS! Paw it out with your friends both online and **offline**. Interact with the world under our realistic physics engine. Did I mention PUPPIES?""

Edit:

The devs responded by pointing out that the game was only playable online during closed testing. I have participated in many closed and open alpha and beta tests and can say this is standard in the industry for a game that hasn't released. Studios typically make playtest builds require internet connection so that they can control when players can access a free copy of the game, stress test servers, collect playtesting data, and avoid the game being accessible early through piracy which is completely reasonable for an unreleased game that noone has bought. With that, an online requirement for an early play test of a game in no way says that the game wouldn't be playable offline on release. As an example COD typically requires you to be online when playing the beta tests however every COD on console has offline play. I would have been shocked if any decent size game was playable offline during playtesting.

But the devs expected me to ignore the product description that specifically said the game was playable offline and judge whether or not the game was playable offline on a closed play test I had access to? You guys said the game was playable offline in the product description and have the audacity to say ""The game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either.""

This lazy attempt at blaming players for trusting their false advertising is ridiculous and ""nonsensical.""",Not Recommended,"1,958 people found this review helpful

Closest server is 'asia' (wherever that actually means). Pings are approx 150+ at all times.

Not the WORST thing for a game like this but it means that your round start screens are slower than other players and the game seems to bug out and put you in spectator mode while it tries to play catch up. That means you're essentially playing a scuffed slow version compared to anyone else.

I've spawned in numerous times only to see my character falling off a bridge without me doing anything. Other players knock me out and just get rid of me before I can actually see anything that's going on.

The characters are adorable and plenty of cute in-game colours to unlock.

Yes there is a gacha system but you don't ever have to touch it, if you need to get a certain skin to enjoy the game, that is all on you they have plenty of animals for free/unlocked through in-game shop and even achievements to be happy with.

Only gripe is I wish costumes were not tied to certain colours, they should of been actual costumes and placed over any colour of said animal it was for.

Long story short? 🤔
The game is fun and justifies its price (I’ve paid ~$6.5) — it has a really slick and nice UI, UX is decent enough, the gameplay is tons of fun and some modes/maps are hilarious 😂

There’s quite a variety of modes:
• Mario Kart alike gamemode
• Fighting maps
• Team based maps where you need to do various objectives (the most diversed mode)
• Smash Bros-esque 6 rounds fighting mode with roguelite (kinda) element!
• Also there’s a hub map (available only in Custom Modes) with 2 board games — one is, basically, UNO, but another one I didn’t try (needs more than 2 players).
• And so on…

My main gripe with the game is that Party Animals desperately needs more content — and I’m not talking about cosmetics, but maps and modes.

Currently, there’s quite little variety!

While the game is fun for the first time which you can prolong by playing a few maps per one time, but you will consume all the content pretty fast. Actually very fast. The game will last way longer if you have friends/family/partner, but it still won’t last long. Maybe a few weekends, tops.

The only solution I see is for the devs to drop one map/mode per month, at least.
Okay, maybe per two months, which is hilariously bad, but still something.

The game is paid but there’s such a huge amount of paid content, it’s baffling.

Like so many paid currencies!

Remember that hub map I’ve talked about? You can buy placeable stuff like swings and fireworks for ONE OF PAID CURRENCIES — and these placeables are CONSUMABLES, so they are not infinite. You can, somehow, earn this paid currency, but it’s very-very slow.

There’s an in-game currency (which you can still exchange to via main paid currency), but you cannot buy much stuff for it. There are even loot boxes. I’m okay-ish with them, however you get very little currency for said loot boxes — though you can pay real money to get them, of course.

Anyway, I wish the devs all the best, I really hope they will add more content reasonably fast.

If they implement some sort of map/mode builder, then it’ll be a banger for sure! 🔥

Well, that’s about it.

Message to the devs ✉️

“You are cooking a really good game, you already making something extremely fun and diverse — please continue making good stuff and do not abandon the game, neither flood it with microtransactions. Also, thanks a lot for the Friend’s Pass system — it’s amazing! We can invite one player for free and play with them in (almost?) all modes!”

P.S:

The game doesn’t have an offline mode (or so it seems). Please keep it in mind. I didn’t test local co-op, but, as far as I understand, it works. However, again, you need to have internet connection. I do not know any limitations of local co-op, but I do know that there’s split screen (not every map/mode has it!) and you can connect multiple controllers.

Hopefully someone will make a handler for this game for NucleusCOOP 💯",Recommended,39,0

Highly recommended for friends playing together in custom games, it's quite fun and perfect for chilling together.

However, the quickplay option is now full of either toxic or sweatlord try hard players mastering the clumsy and sluggish physics and controls of this game (made on purpose) thus ruining all the fun more casual players could have otherwise by solo-carrying whole games.

I'll post here one of the most relevant comments i've seen illustrating what i'm talking about :

From the player/steam user CrispFlake answering to a thread titled ""too many sweatlords try-harders ruining this game"" :


80% of the games i get today are what CrispFlake is describing.

i'll also add that if you're a keyboard users then you should just either avoid this game or accept being less potent than controller users as the WASD in this kind of gameplay is less efficient than an analog joystick and the game and game physics is based on move sets fully exploiting rotations executions made possible by analog joysticks mainly (doable but way harder on keyboard and trully less intuitive).",Not Recommended,144,7

I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.",Recommended,603,0

As I am from South Africa, creating a custom game to simply play alone against AI or with some friends, we are limited to have to connect to a server with 200 ping.

This is unbearable as this game is physics-based and even our inputs feel delayed.

I have also read that there seems to be no intention to add local play so I doubt P2P will happen either.

The only reason I would buy this game again (which I genuinely would as it seems like tons of fun) would be if either servers in my region are added, or if we could host our own servers (P2P or dedicated).

TL;DR:
Seems like tons of fun, but I cannot recommend playing it at 200 ping.",Not Recommended,221,11

Ok, so lets clear some things up.

This game has mixed reviews, which this game definitely does not deserve.

Lots of people are giving this game negative reviews because of the fact that the game does not have an 'offline' singe-player mode, or because of the fact that the game has micro-transactions.

Let's start with the offline single-player mode.

To clear things up; the game DOES support couch split-screen co-op. The only thing it doesn't support is offline play, as you need an online connection to be able to play the game at all. I do understand people being upset about this, as the devs could have been more clear about this, and shouldn't have used the word 'offline' in the game description (which they removed as of now).

Micro-transactions

In no way is this game pay-to-win. All the micro-transactions in this game are cosmetic, and don't give you an advantage in any way. Matter of fact, both types of currency's are obtainable through just playing the game, and completing weekly/daily challenges! Which means that if you want to spend money to get your characters to look different, go ahead! But it's also obtainable by just playing the game and saving up the currency you get!


Even though i haven't played a lot yet, I can definitely say that I love this game. If you liked Gang Beasts, you're gonna love this one. The gameplay is almost identical, though it feels a little less clunky, and more controllable. Also the fact that this game adds quite some weapons to use, quite a lot of maps on release, and several game-modes to play, makes it so the game doesn't get old quick (which I did have with Gang Beasts). If the devs continue to update the game with more maps, game-modes, weapons and characters (which they are actively doing right now), this game is going to be fun, and fresh for a long time!

If you liked Gang Beasts, you're definitely gonna love this one. Don't let the reviews fool you, the game is a blast! Especially with friends.",Recommended,363,21

The game looked fun and it is fun, however I payed for the game and didn't realize it has micro-transactions as well. This really bummed me out, and this could've easily been resolved by just selling more skin/character packs in the Steam DLC shop so I can just purchase them directly in bulk! I figured out that the Cult of the Lamb character costs more than the game itself, which converting from Cookies to Nemo Bucks to US Dollars is close to 22.99USD, while at its cheapest maybe 22.37USD from its base cost of 240 Nemo Bucks equivalent to 1.79USD. It even has a gacha system called ""Surprise Eggs"", and a coin for 1 egg is equivalent to cost of .90USD while getting 10 eggs is equivalent to 8.99USD. While I'm writing this, the Shen Loong event has a time window from Febuary 7th to the 25th to get all the dragon stuff and skins by playing the challenges, BUT the challenges are limited to only 4 every 20 hour cool-down. So you can't be able to play more of them to achieve the skins you want without paying for them! Players don't want to wait for that long and the game encourages the fear of missing out, which causes people to just buy the event character skins and stuff out of frustration. The total cost of the Shen Loong pass is close to the equivalent currency of 62.93USD! Nobody is immune to micro-transactions and gacha games and I REALLY wish this game didn't have them.

To everyone reading all of the bad reviews, I would just like to stop you and express my humble opinion. This game is AMAZING. I have spent countless hours (115.8 hrs) on this game either trying to get stupid hard achievements or pissing off my friends by killing them. This game ISN'T a cash grab, I haven't spent an extra dime on this game and I've collected around 188 different skins (including the Platinum Puppy) by just playing the game. I do have to say though, if you are interested in this game and are considering buying it, force a friend to buy it with you... By any means possible... They might not be your friend for very long, but it's worth it. I would sell my friend for this game every day of the week.",Recommended,51,3

Party animals is a very hot and cold game. The team score games like soccer and hockey are great. The nfl one is one of the very best modes in gaming maybe ever, I say this as one of the best nfl party animals players on the game. (I don't have any stats to back up this statement, but I dominate this game mode every time).
The last stand modes however are RIGGED. Maps like submarine and airplane are quack, and the gas on ichiban is rng.
Monetization for the game is also a huge L.
I still recommend this game for the team modes, specifically nfl, and the ability to play as a lizard.",Recommended,51,3

I really really want to recommend this game, but the state it is in at this very moment I cannot.

The concept is amazing, and I adore all the cute animals along with the cosmetics that are out, and the collabs they've done. Visually it is a really good, a cute cartoon-y game where you get to be a stuffed animal.

Unfortunately, the community is already incredibly toxic and the game hasn't even been out more than two weeks. I am a girl and I feel like I am in a COD lobby by the amount of hate I get when speaking. It is very common to get cussed out in games and called slurs because you knocked somebody out or are just playing that game the way it is meant to be played, OR because you sound like a girl.

You would think with the game being about really cute stuffed animals the community would be nice and welcoming, but it's not. You can argue that I should just mute the voice chat or just ignore it, but the game was made with voice chat and I enjoy interacting with the wholesome section of this community, the ones that are just trying to have fun and don't threaten to un-alive you for knocking them out.

And the game play, I could write an entire review just about this. You can pick up a weapon, and it is pretty much game over for everyone else without a weapon unless the weapon holder is miraculously knocked out, or they run out of stamina. If you get nun-chucks or a shovel then it is almost impossible to get close enough to that person to knock them out, especially on maps like the alligator river or airplane, because those are not at all forgiving and one misjudged jump is the end. I think weapons should have some type of cool down or some type of durability at least. There should be no reason a single cat with a pair of nun-chucks can knock out eight people in a row and win the game simply because they were the first person to pick up a weapon. It is ridiculous.

Speaking of being knocked out, what is the point in playing when people can just stand over you and continuously knock you out? There have been many times where somebody is upset and targets me or another person and tries to keep them knocked out for the entirety of that game, and it is incredibly frustrating to stand up only to be drop kicked into the shadow realm once again.

This is just a quality of life request really, but they should add something in the game where you can see your own stuffed animal better. This would help visually impaired individuals, because sometimes you can lose your own character in the chaos of everyone. Maybe a little glowing outline or something else to better indicate where you are in the group.

Overall, I like the concept of this game. It is cute and fun with friends, but it certainly can be improved. If you are looking to buy it I would wait a little while to see if there are any updates.

Having played the game practically since its release, I think I have a good overview of its evolution so far and, unfortunately, since its launch. Too little has gone in the right direction...

Improving on the gang beast concept, it had everything to please graphically. There are even a plethora of good arguments to recommend this game to you, but...

At launch, the game was sold as an 8-player brawler featuring some twenty different maps:
- 9 Last Stand maps (fighting in teams of 2 or 4)
- 9 Team Score maps (4vs4 with objectives to reach)
- 2 Arcade maps (can only be played by creating a private lobby or joining one).

In the first few months, the Chinese studio got the job done. Just over a month after the game's release, on Halloween, the developers were already adding relative content. But at the same time, problems were already beginning to emerge as the Chinese studio partnered with Chinese streaming platforms (Bilibili and Douyin to start with) and granted them exclusive skins (for Halloween, for example) that could only be obtained by Chinese users, thus penalizing other players. This led to a number of problems, as these skins, obtained by code, could (to cut a long story short) be used twice. As a result, Chinese players, having used the code once for themselves, would try to exchange it with players from Europe, North America, South America... for a code that the studio had set up with Discord (also usable twice) and which penalized Chinese players. In this code exchange, there were numerous scams on both sides, and in the end, it created a very bad climate between the gaming communities.

Shortly afterwards, the studio announced its roadmap, explaining that there would be a major update every 3 months, including a new map and new skins, which augured well for the future.

The problem was that their first major update was delayed by a month. To fill the gap, they added a new map and introduced the “Friend Pass”, allowing players to invite their friends to play the game with them for free. A fine initiative, to be sure.

Unfortunately, the worrying comments made by the studio were already summed up in this sentence: “We've noticed that many players are looking for a place to chat with others, rather than just fight” (patch note dated 16/12/2023). I don't know which players they're talking about, but nobody expected the studio to focus their money and energy on creating a place within the game where players could chat instead of fighting... Not only because this place already exists (the arcade maps), but also because if players have paid for a fighting game, it's because they want content related to what they've paid for!

At the end of January, these concerns prove to be well-founded. Their first update for the brawler they'd sold to players introduced a UNO game renamed PAWS in one of the arcade maps, as well as a jukebox... THAT'S IT! To counterbalance the anger of the players, less than 10 days later they released a new map, which didn't convince anyone because it was too similar in principle to another existing map.

The 2nd update doesn't do much better, as it also arrives a month late, and once again takes players by surprise. It introduces a new game mode with 2 missions playable solo or in pairs against bots. After 10 minutes of discovery to complete them (and I'm still being kind), you start to wonder if you haven't been ripped off, as the devs are moving further and further away from the fighting game they originally sold us.

Well, I'm tempering that a little, because there's one good thing in this update, and that's the appearance of another game mode, “SMASH”, which fits into the “combat” category. It's well thought-out, it's fun and it deserves to be said.

The 3rd update arrived on schedule! Are we going back to basics? No, of course not. This time, Recreate set out to offer players a Mario Kart version of Party Animals. It's certainly well done, and there's much more fun to be had in the one and only race than in the 2 challenge missions of the previous update, but when are you going to keep your promises? Where's the roadmap?

But all this is nothing compared to what's to come. The ultimate betrayal that buries the game for good. In the game, there are several ways to knock out your opponents:
- Light punching is the use of small punches (LP).
- Heavy punch: run and punch (HP)
- Dropkick: jump and kick (DK)
- Headbutt is a headbutt (HB)

There are two other techniques which are not explained in the game's tutorial and which have been found by players through experimentation:
- The superman punch is a combination of three keys and allows the player to levitate briefly after his punch.
- The fling is an improvement on the superman punch, combining 4 keys and allowing the player to project himself in the direction of his choice, knocking out anyone in his path. On the other hand, the fling is not without risk, as it can backfire if misdirected or controlled.

These techniques, and the fling in particular, have rapidly become extremely popular among players, because although they are extremely satisfying to perform, mastering them requires training and demonstrates a skill that any player wishing to improve must master.

Can you see it coming? At Recreate, they're doing everything they can to kill the fun. Since the release of their game, they've only done what they wanted to do, and whether we like it or not, that's the way it is. Our only treasure was the fling, but they took it away from us.

Faced with the tidal wave of anger, they backed down, but in the worst possible way. The fling now consumes a phenomenal amount of stamina and can no longer be played...

Worse still, the fling's nerf has created a domino effect on all gameplay, and the game's dynamics have been completely ruined:
- HP has become punishing for the user, as it consumes far more stamina and hits the opponent even less than before.
- The LP, which already consumed no stamina, has become much better, as it hits far more than the HP.
- DK has become exceptional

Before the nerf, the game required skill. It wasn't simply a matter of doing DK over and over again. In your desire to make the game more user-friendly for new players, you've not hesitated to scuttle the rules of the game. What you're doing is not the right solution. All you're doing is making the game less attractive. You change the rules without prior communication, without even telling the players what has changed. You're gradually destroying the trust and esteem the players had in you.

At the time of writing, there are barely 3,000 daily players on the game. This pales in comparison with the 60,000 of the early days. This lack of players has prompted Recreate to find “solutions”. Already present from the start of the game, bots have become the most important player community. If you thought you were playing with a player called SnoopDogg or PapaSmurf, you're just playing with a bot. Their intelligence is disastrous, and you'll soon realize it. Bots are of no use to the game. Worse still, there's a good chance they'll get in your way or accidentally kill you.

It seems vital to go back to an earlier version of the gameplay mechanics and the very foundations of the game. Until this is done, this game deserves this comment.",Not Recommended,67,4

Local Play is a mediocre experience with huge frame drops when using split screen (split screen already being a HUGE disappointment), the obvious predatory features like loot boxes/gacha/insane in-game currency prices in general, and there's no visible road-map provided on any of the game's social media pages; there really hasn't been any notable updates, besides minor bug fixes, within the month that it has been out. This game has a potential to be REALLY great considering it has such a vibrant artstyle and well-constructed maps, but it can be SO much better if the devs can manage to unplug their ears to hear the community.

Future Edit: The Party Animals website now links a forum where you can both ask questions, show your concerns, and even connect with developers through a ""Q and A"" format periodically. I believe they've become much more open with the community and seem to have strong plans for the future of this game. Please check it out! I can confidently say that I DO recommend this game now.",Recommended,28 people found this review helpful 0,1

Absolutely ridiculous from start to finish how the developers have acted. They shamelessly attempt to gaslight their own customers who point out their shortcomings. They have a mass amount of microtransactions in their game on RELEASE! For a game you just BOUGHT! On top of all their mistakes, they also decided that forcing everyone to play on a global server with FORCED input latency would be a good idea! So not only did we get scammed out of offline mode on release day, microtransactions shoved down our throat on release day, but now you don't even get to fully enjoy the game because everything you do happens a full second after you try to do it.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The developers have proven very quickly that they do not care about their customers. They simply want to milk as many dollars out of you as possible before you can't take their crap anymore. It's insane that it took them 3 years to turn a promising party game into a chinese water torture sim. I wish I could refund this game.",Not Recommended,486,0

A Well Deserved 5/10.

10 Hour Later Update:

Party Animals is still a very fun game marred by idiotic and questionable design choices.

The Good
Fun gameplay and physics, some fun levels. Good times fighting friends online. You'll for sure get a laugh out of it.
Lot's of characters to choose from. Many are unlocked by achievements, though some can be very frustrating, it's nice that they are there.








Mostly just a quick summary of my initial thoughts. I think the developers should re-visit local play, as well as offline if this is indeed supposed to be a party game. I already know nothing will be done about their macrotransactions as whales are sure to keep spending. Game will need more levels ASAP or people will definitely start getting bored.

If all the things I listed above don't sound like they'd bother you, then maybe you'd enjoy Party Animals. It can be fun and hilarious, but as of right now the cons outweigh the pros.

If this review makes you mad because you associate this game with your own identity, leave a comment crying about it. Surely it'll make you feel better.",Not Recommended,531,24

Party Animals: A Review Where Fur Flies and Friendships Fray

Forget the picket fences and cozy crafting of other survival games. Party Animals throws you headfirst into a chaotic world where the cutest creatures become the most deranged brawlers. This isn't your grandma's tea party – it's a hilarious physics-based battle royale where the only thing softer than the characters are their landings.

Get into chaotic brawls! 
A Screenshot of Party Animals
By: Nirhildija



Party Animals' charm lies in its utter pandemonium. The wobbly physics turns every punch, flail, and flying body into a side-splitting spectacle. Sending your best friend plummeting off a cliff or into a spinning fan never gets old – just make sure you're not next!




Don't let the cuddly exteriors fool you. Party Animals offers a surprising amount of depth. Choose your favorite fighter from a quirky cast, each with its particular style and humor! Multiple game modes keep things fresh, from free-for-alls to objective-based battles where teamwork (or lack thereof) is key. Play soccer games, survive black holes, or be the last animal standing in a submerging submarine!




While the core gameplay is a blast, there are a few things to consider. The physics-based controls take some getting used to, and mastering throws and dodges requires practice. Half the battle in Party Animals is fighting the controller! (and button smashing to get up~). The current map selection, while creative, could be expanded for long-term play. Local multiplayer feels less polished compared to the smooth online experience.



Party Animals is a fantastic party game for anyone looking to unleash their inner animal (and unleash some hilarious chaos) with friends. The wacky physics, multiple modes, and adorable cast create an unforgettable experience. While the learning curve exists and the maps could be more plentiful, Party Animals is a must-have for your next game night. Just remember – friendships may be tested, but your sides will be split with laughter!

A friend bought this for me because we both enjoyed Gang Beasts and he figured we'd both enjoy this one, too. He wasn't wrong.

The core concept and gameplay loop are both fun, and we find that not taking the game seriously (that is, just goofing around and enjoying the silly spectacle of animals beating each other up with frying pans, baseball bats, nunchucks, and more) is leagues more enjoyable than when you try really hard. That kind of play saps all the fun out of the experience, and unfortunately you do get some players who do exactly that.

This game is also more content-rich than Gang Beasts (more game modes; each map has a specific mode and gimmick(s) attached to it) which is an added plus, on top of the animals being generally adorable (or silly, in some cases, like Barbie the gorilla, or Underbite the dinosaur(?)).

As much as I do like playing the game, I must admit I do not condone some of the developer's choices, such as the addition of microtransactions (albeit just for cosmetics; several base animals are unlocked by default, but many skins and outfits are locked behind the in-game shop--which may cost ""cookies"" (standard currency) or ""Nemo bucks"" (premium currency) or sometimes even actual US dollars--whose contents change daily for common/uncommon skins and weekly for the rarer stuff; other cosmetics can be acquired through level-up progression or unlocking certain achievements) or the total lack of an offline mode; the latter point means that the game can potentially become totally unplayable for some or all players globally, so keep that in mind.

Overall, it's not bad. I would've done some things differently had I been at the helm of the project, but that's just me. If you liked Gang Beasts (or anything similar), you'll probably enjoy this, too.",Recommended,48,0

I am a 44 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started this game and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Recommended,176,0

i like this game so far! it's pretty fun to mess around with the items and the maps are unique and interesting. also, barbie is the best animal. by far. no contest. gorilla nation!!

i do have 3 pretty big gripes though. first, having paid item shops in an already paid game is a little dumb. i know you don't HAVE to pay for the currency, but the free ways to get it are grind-y and also it is sort of the only way to get the nemo-buck only skins that are in the shop in time. second, the way they pair people of similar levels together is HORRIBLE. i'm not even sure it exists. at the time of writing this review, i'm level 9 and not very good at the game. the people i get paired with look like they're level 30 usually and they just steamroll my team. it's not fair at all and before you think ""skill issue"", you're right. that's the point. my skill issue makes it unfair to fight experienced players. third, the community is kinda toxic. not much you can do about this as devs but just thought i would point it out for other newer players.

despite the paragraph about my problems with the game being 5 times as big as the positives, i REALLY do like this game. it's fun and i can't wait to try it out with a group on the couch one night. just a few kinks to be ironed out, other than that it's a blast.",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 0,0

I also want to address (some) of the negative reviews I've seen here. They are written by total tryhard sweats who are upset that this casual game is balanced to stay casual (in a good way) to attract as many people as possible. I can assure you, you don't want to play against these people complaining here, ignore them, they are not fun to play with in this game. And this game is fun.
And also a big plus of this game is that it has the recently added karting mode. There aren't many good karting games on PC. This one is.

Let's be honest. I am from what someone would call ""a region with restricted access"". I.e. China. I am writing this review partly because of the grudge accumulated from the years of waiting, being mistreated and outright abused, and partly because of the necessity of clarifying why we, as a whole, have such a negative attitude towards Recreate, the company that made this Game. I am writing this in English so that all of you, the honest players, can take a peek at what happened behind the colourful screen.

## Can We Talk About the Game First?

Sure. Party Animals is, as you've guessed from the name, a party game. It follows the slapstick formula with cute, fluffy animals as the dressing. It is visually appealing and is an easy pick-up for players at all levels.

The control is intentionally awkward so it fits the ""everyone can have fun"" party game style. You don't have to worry about someone being too pro at the game that it would crush the competition. But this awkwardness takes some time to get used to. For starters, you can't really control where you are facing and the pick-and-grab mechanism will get in the way if you spam the grab button, trying to pick up the key item.

Aside from the brawl, there are a lot of minigames that spice up the tone. But what minigame you get to play depends on the roll of the dice (and the minds of other players). Each round, you get 3 randomly selected maps to vote for.

The biggest downside is the **lack of local multiplayer**. As a party game, it is a courageous decision not to have a local multiplayer mode. My guess is that all the maps are designed around the 8-player versus mode. Typical 4-player mode won't make the cut.

The price point is also a bit too high for a party game. Oh, it might not be the case for YOUR region. In addition to the microtransaction built-in, I honestly don't know what should I feel. I paid a premium for this Game, only to be hit by a gacha machine in the face.

I guess it's a good time to explain the grudge.

## Why the Negativity?

As you may have known, Recreate is a Chinese company. I am not hinting about all the conspiracies revolving around privacy issues and data breaching -- it's too bland even for an avid conspiracy theorist. I am talking about the aspect of community management.

Recreate, at least in the domestic market, did not perform well in community management. Back in late 2019, when everything was still in the good ol' order, Recreate had released a beta version of the Game. The Game was already well-polished. We were all hyped and expected its release.

However, this is where it all started to go downhill.

It starts with the delays. Well, I guess that's a norm for game development. They always delay. But a three-year delay is more than what we can manage. During the Pandemic, while we were staying indoors, longing for a game for distraction, Recreate had chosen to ""perfect"" their work. They wanted ""a better hair rendition"" for the animal avatars. Okay, it's their artistic decisions. I won't judge. But what we have here is something practically identical to the 2019 demo. I guess they have improved the hair rendering code so it can run on a lower-end machine. (What's funny is that this fine hair rendering looks quite strange on Xbox such that some are questioning why the animals look jagged. I think they have fixed this issue but, still!)

If it's only that simple, I don't think it deserves such a bad rating.

As I have stated from the start, it all comes down to the community management. Party Animals was officially announced to the domestic market as early as 2020. But for all these years, there is virtually no official announcement made. No devlogs. No progress indication. Nothing. However, they haven't missed any international game events -- there were ads being made.

I mean, really? You have the manhours to make those ads, but not posting a tweet about where the project is going? Seriously?

I guess ads also count, at least they can let us take a peek at what the game would be, followed by a date that's either too vague or will get delayed (again). They didn't even bother to add a Chinese subtitle. All the press materials come in English first.

Fine. I'll take that as a try of i18n. Recreate wants to ship the game overseas. They are an ambitious company. But it just nudges the domestic market in a wrong way.

And then, the utterly tone-deaf interviews landed. Producer Luo, I remember that you said you wanted to make a ""perfect game"". Is this what you've dreamed of? Maybe. It's glitch-free. It is perfect in the sense that it runs without a hiccup. But a game is consumed with paratexts. A game cannot be played in a vacuum, in an idealized plane. I don't want to be harsh towards the developers and artists working for Recreate, but Animal Party is a dumpster fire and you know it. Are your servers stressing out? Should we ""buy the game but never play it""? Because ""as soon as we started playing it, [you are] losing money""? I know it's meant as a joke. It's a joke that nobody laughed.

98 CNY. Is this the price you are asking for? For a party game? Sure, I can afford that. But you chose to not add local multiplayer. It means if I wanted to invite my friends to play this game, they would have to pay for a copy themselves! That's a red bank note a pop! Let's have a check on other party games. Almost all of them are below 50 CNY. For those who didn't see the problem: imagine that this game asks for $40 or more, will you be so tolerant to microtransactions? Will you still think that ""fluffy animal cute""?

About the controversial naming, I'd left it aside. Again, those are jokes, whether intentional or not, that got nobody laughing. Well, maybe some laughed. Puns to vulgar terms always work as a filler. At least the name was addressed before the launch. I'll give it a pass.

I'd like to address some additional operations from Recreate in the domestic market. We do have a homegrown gaming community and it is as toxic and chaotic as yours. In the Party Animals board, there is not a single negative review of the game. You should really give the board moderator a raise. They are developing tenosynovitis just from swinging the ban hammer too much.

## Can Recreate Redeem Itself?

Now the Game is finally released for good. We laughed, we wept.

A game company, no matter the size, can always redeem itself. But not by doing the wrong thing one after another. None of the problems were unredeemable, but without proper treatment, they would accumulate and finally burst.

The game itself is of great quality (in terms of overall robustness). But the community disaster has already happened. Let's see if Recreate can come up with something better to turn this thumb upside-down.

Oh, by the way, if the game becomes F2P in a year (with boosted microtransactions), I would consider it a backstabbing move and this review will become settled.",Not Recommended,693,0

Playing this since release, I have now surpassed 500 hours in this creative masterpiece, and am desperately attempting to take a break from it, I feel like it's a good milestone to take some time and talk about it.

I have no doubt I will spend thousands of hours here as the time goes. This game has been no contest the alltime best investment of my money on Steam, and that won't change simply because of how much fun I've had with it already. I laughed in the ways I didn't know I could laugh, and honestly - I really needed that. I never expected it to tick all my boxes, but it sure did.

This game is goofy, silly, random and super stylish. Everything, EVERYTHING is superb- gameplay mechanics, visual presentation and the kickass funk fusion of a soundtrack. Even the tiny references here and there to various creative works around the world.

Even if it doesn't seem to be your cup of tea, even if you are turned away by XYZ things about it - just play 10 or so games, and I guarantee you will have a good chuckle at some point.



Even though the game is very random at times (and that's its design intention, even though I may not agree with some parts of it), there's plenty room for being competitive and showing ""skill"", which I personally consider important. It's this mix of pure random and skill based factors that make it more fun for me, there's a certain beauty in trying to tame the chaotic nature of the game.

Oh, and it's a great place to make friends, actually really great.

Now the devs themselves have admitted this is their first serious project and they are new to game development, it shows partially, but I haven't really seen anything critically bad. So far they have responded rather quickly to critical game issues, bugs, and at the same time add more and more content to the game.

A lot of the criticism regarding the game I don't get, like the micro transaction stuff, there's nothing wrong with it. It's not a pay to win game or heavily micro transaction based. If you don't gamble all your ""Nemo Bucks"" away on eggs to get the skins that will always be available, especially now with the redesigned reward system, the developers give you around 10k of those for free as long as you reach Level 100 (a bit of a grind, but not tedious in the slightest). You can also get that currency from mystery boxes that drop daily.

There are a bunch of bugs that haven't been adressed for a long time (like the bugged steam friendlist), but I can forgive that. The rest is just miscellaneous game random or ping related things, or servers lagging because more and more people flock to the game.

All in all, I find it simply great and it has quickly become one of my all-time favorite games. I hope it thrives and flourishes for a long time, and more people get to experience this amazing unhinged chaos. 🙂

The gameplay is fun, and most importantly, funny. It looks pretty good too.

However, I'm gonna have to give this a negative review for now.

Their store is predatory, with skins that cost more than the game itself, multiple currencies, real money lootboxes (that can be duplicates!), timed sales to abuse that fear of missing out, twitch drops, you know the deal.

Also, the censorship is insane. You can barely complete an English sentence without it being censored, making people think you're cussing, which in turn gets you reported, and then (temporarily) banned. Want to appeal that ban? Tough luck: you'll have to write a ticket on their website for that, but it won't even allow you to login.

These devs are clearly inexperienced, have no clue about the English language, and have spent most of the development time on making a predatory store.

Introduced by a close friend, it was no mistake. It's a cute animal game that is a lot of fun, and slightly competitive. The different animals and outfits make everything more enjoyable. I'm currently trying to get more of my friends to play it because it's that much fun, and there is always laughs.

Only thing that isn't so great about it is some people are really toxic. In a game like this, with silly animals. Unfortunately they play these games too, so watch out for them. Otherwise definitely get it.",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 1,0

The game is very fun, but immediately unfun when you knock someone down and they get up in 2 seconds, then you get light punched and you're out in 5 seconds, thrown out of the ring in 2, and dead in 1. The game needs a knockout ring timer or some form of understanding as to why there's so much inconsistency with knockouts. This inconsistency spreads elsewhere, one second I'm tossing someone in the ice and they swim for a good 3 seconds, climb up, get knocked down in the water and are able to climb out once more, then if I get pushed off within those 3 seconds I'm froze, there are many examples of this and it makes the game very unfun when at its core it's a pretty enjoyable party game with some really fun games, but it's just too much, maybe in future updates......but I have a weird feeling that this is something that'll remain very much the same game with no major QoL changes or updates made but I'd like to be wrong and I'd like to change my review if those things happen along with it.",Not Recommended,97,7

In a world full of live service games fueled by corporate incompetence and greed, this one keeps getting free updates to the point I feel I should be able to support the devs more. I bought the game once and that was it.

That being said, it's a game prone to receiving updates that make drastic changes in how overall gameplay feels, which could prove harmful to your experience in the long run.

7/20/24: For the foreseeable future, I have quit Party Animals, and suspect it will be indefinite. Instead of updates to refine connectivity and reduce latency input from an unfortunately always-online game, we got those which managed to make PAWS less fun. The new power-up mode was kind of fun, if not broken, and certainly not suitable for Quick Match, a mode that already suffers from being somewhat a good time at best and utterly insufferable at worst. Soon after, an update introduces it to Quick Match. Now, we have a kart game mode in early beta. All of this while the skin prices and battle pass progression continue to be utterly egregious, at the same time as xp rewards continue to dwindle so you'll just keep playing this live service game. While I understand why this is being done from a business perspective, I do not have time for a game which seems to prefer having an identity crisis compared to what the game originally was when I demoed it years ago, versus fixing what I originally paid for. No more. None of what I originally criticized has been fixed in the game's current state, therefore no more. There are too many excellent and outright better games to play out there compared to Party Animals, and I suggest you spend your time elsewhere even if you find the characters adorable.

Note #3: will edit again, but to keep it short, I've discovered custom matches only award you a quarter of what quick matches do for winning. Will reflect this proper in review. It is apparent that earning only 1 xp in custom matches on release to have been a bug, and I appreciate the developers fixing that.

Speaking from the perspective of someone who wanted the game solely to play custom matches with friends.

Started playing second playtest, was awesome, wasn't even aware of an XP cap on custom games because it was so lenient.

Third playtest, hit the cap in less than an hour of play. Okay, a little fair, can't have people grinding premium cosmetics with bots, but still. Gave feedback requesting that it should be increased, or that we should receive a % less once the daily limit is hit, until it's reset.

Boot up the game today to see what's happened, earned exactly 1 XP for a match by myself, based on ""game time"". Later I would see the same thing happen when playing with a friend locally, no matter how long our match lasted. What on earth. It's possible to earn XP with one other online player in your lobby, albeit much less than we ever earned during playtests, so it's still far from ideal.

While cosmetics are not everything, to be able to earn fair progression by playing with friends is all I ever originally asked for. I tried quick matches, and it was awful; everyone was sweating for achievements and/or xp, and i suspect it will only get much, much worse now that custom matches are no longer an option (unless you want to play literal thousands of matches to progress *one* level). Not me, not my friends, not anybody should be walled off from progressing in a party game because we decide how we want to have fun with it.

The microtransactions are frankly egregious, and initially I excused it because it wouldn't be that hard to earn them with xp, even with the third playtest's crappy daily cap. Now? Money is the only way for me & others who refuse quick matches, and I'm not very inclined to spend anything further after the game's turning out on release day.

And there's the fact that the game is online-only, which is pretty silly for a party game. While the team is chalking it up to a misinterpretation due to translation, and that could very well be the truth, I'm not sure. There had to be time to make this very clear to the players, especially considering the practice of online-only games has gained infamy for its use.

Please make it so that people can actually earn XP/earn a decent amount of XP from custom games again. What took a few hours of play over the course of 2 days during Playtest #2 to get to Level 26 has already been a crawl in comparison over 3; currently just hit Level 20.

While I understand offline mode won't come in a day, that would be great, too.

When I first played the game in 2020, I saw it as the new Gang Beasts, because said game managed to be ruined from the alpha days leading up to final release, and I thought Party Animals would be an exception. I hoped it would not become the same story, but here we are. Although I am certainly enjoying the core gameplay--it is much more fun than Gang Beasts was on retail release--I cannot recommend anyone buy this game in its current state, until, at the very least, the grievances about micros & XP gain are fixed.

Please do not let the game go out like this.",Not Recommended,17,0

This game is Gang Beasts and more, AND polished, AND near-perfect online as well as local, and it retains all the charm. There were only a couple lame maps and modes, the rest were gold.

I can't complain about anything besides problems that Gang Beasts had as well, such as the knock-out mechanic not always being the funnest. It serves a purpose in keeping the game moving and preventing a stalemate, but there's ways to achieve that other than just disabling someone's controls for an upwards of 15 whole seconds.

Overall I think this takes Gang Beasts' place as the classic, ruthless sumo boxing game from now on.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

Party Animals looked like a fun party game with adorable aesthetics, but the lack of an offline mode is a huge letdown. I just wanted to play with friends on the couch, but online connectivity is mandatory (which takes away the pausing option and can cause lag, IN A LOCAL GAME!)

On top of that, the microtransactions, gacha mechanics and FOMO content scream exploitative practices. it feels like a cash grab more than a fun party experience.

This isn't the modernized Gang Beasts I was hoping for. Overall, I'm bummed about the experience and will be refunding the game, because even the idea of supporting these new game industry trends disgusts me.",Not Recommended,95,0

there seems to be local servers now which is a great advancement, and you can play it locally, with 50 ping, but better than 190; just wish i could play with the friends that are in the couch with me online with other people, but only if they bought the game they can join, no split screen allowed in quick matches :(

no south america or brazil servers, and can't be played local, i'll wait for the server if it comes, and will live through the pain of playing at 190 ping with the people in the same room as me D:",Recommended,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0,0

Please Read before you buy

There's a lot to like, but let's be real and address all the negatives first and foremost:

1) The game is always played with 8 people. So if you've only got three friends who own the game, prepare to be matched with 8 random internet strangers, some of whom are probably 5 years old, all of whom are pretty awful. ""Well, that's not so bad, as long as my friends and I are on a team,"" I hear you say. *ahem*
2) Whether your game is a free for all, four teams of two, or two teams of four is entirely dependent on the arena selected and, I'll remind you, random internet strangers will be the ones controlling at least a considerable slice of this vote.
3) You could work around issues 1 and 2 if the game would take a leaf from Rocket League's playbook and allow you and your group of friends to select the sort of match you'd like to play before queuing up. Seriously, why can't me and 3 friends select ""4v4 matchmaking"" and then be presented ONLY with arenas that are compatible with that? AT THIS STAGE, I'M NOT ASKING FOR NEW ARENAS OR GAMEPLAY MECHANICS -- just a filter!
4) Some new game modes would be helpful, but even they don't require all new arenas to be made. Ice Hockey, Soccer, etc could still be fun even in a 2v2 setting. But no, you *have* to be online in this PARTY game with ""PARTY"" literally written in the name. And the ""why"" you have to be online might be the biggest downside of this game by far:
5) This is a game that you purchase (for $20 USD, no less) that then expects you to shell out money indefinitely for costumes and characters. I want you to pay attention to the quotation marks I'm about to use here, because they mean a lot tonally: You can ""earn"" opportunities to ""win"" a ""chance"" at a character or costume that you want, but those require you to win matches and earn experience points. Not only does the experience required to go from level to level increase drastically (meaning that you might need to win 10 matches to ""earn"" your first ""chance"" at a character or costume, but you'll have to win 30 to ""earn"" your next), but their tied to your ""animal level"" which has a limit.

So even if you were MADE of free time and just really LOVED the game, you will eventually run out of opportunities to 'win' the character or costume you want and there are already far more characters and costumes than there will be ever be opportunities you can ""earn"" as opposed to ""buy.""

Does any of this sound familiar to you? Well, it should if you're familiar with the rise and fall (heheh) of ""Fall Guys"" which started as a pay-to-play game, people were irritated at the level of money the game was expecting you to pump into it for cosmetics and so started requesting refunds. Steam put pressure on the publisher to change their pricing, and they said, ""well if you want us to go free to play, we'll sign on with Epic since they'll pay us for exclusivity on PC"" and even with their sizable check from Epic and all the whales spending real life money to buy cosmetics, the devs still abandoned any efforts to stop hackers/cheaters from ruining the game for everyone leading in a rapid decrease in the game's popularity.



So with that all said, let's address the good: Do you like gang beasts? Well this is that but with cute animals.

If that's enough for you to enjoy yourself, then by all means have fun. But you might be better waiting for this game to become free to play, which I can pretty well guarantee will happen sooner than later.",Not Recommended,291,25

Game was really fun until the lastest updates and many changes.
I would understand the frustration of some players but removing a simple mechanic of the game which in fact was not game breaking at all but like a bonus that "" everyone "" could use is just a weird decision.
Instead of removing it a more democratic approach would ve been to adopt it and introduce it officially so that it could be "" an optional "" move that player could use sometimes considered as cheating "" which was not and didn't guarantee a win.
I really would like Recreate to backtrack on that move and revert back to introduce that mechanic back into the game and make it official. Also the animation of it was really cool and funny.
After being part of the beta since 2020 and putting hours into the game with all my heart heart , especially with nice people from the community and fanbase it is a disapointment to witness such a division and seing the game going the way it is. It does have potential. But as for now it has lots its way through the many changes it went through.",Not Recommended,26,1

In the first round, in the first brawl, when the mayhem first descended, one stood. Scorched by the hellish chaos, his spirit seared by the infernal battle and tainted by a thirst for supremacy—he chose the path of unyielding domination. In his relentless pursuit of victory, he knew no mercy; and with bloodthirsty determination, he scoured the arenas, seeking retribution against the ravenous beasts who dared to challenge him. He wore the crown of the Animal Annihilators, and those who faced the might of his fists named him... the Party Slayer.

I'll be honest..

I have spent far more time on this game over the last week + since buying it than I probably should have. Any time I have had free time, this game has taken priority because, as frustrating as it can be when things don't go the way you wanted them to, it's so darn silly and such good fun it's hard NOT to want to play it. Subtract about 6 - 8 hours at a guess from leaving the game running whilst AFK, and that's the genuine playtime.

Let's talk about this awesome little game and it's modes.

Last-Team Standing, with sports based and objective modes, all of the fun stuff.
Pure combat. Every round, pick a card based power up and win points over six rounds.
Kart-racing. More or less a carbon-copy of MK and a mid one at that.

Classic is, for me, the ideal, go-to mode. You have your combat maps, you have maps designed around securing objectives whilst fighting and you have maps designed around fighting and playing sports.

SMASH is, okay? If you like pure combat and no real objectives, this one is great as it'll rotate maps between rounds as you secure power-ups. Comeback potential is there as later rounds afford more points.

Nemo Kart is not that good. No reason to play it over other well designed alternatives really. It's there, but I think the developers should focus on other things, it's sub-par to me.



It's goofy, physics based, doesn't always go the way you expect it nor want it to, but even when it's frustrating, it's grand. I'd be lying if I said I haven't had mid-game mini-rants, arguing as to why I'm knocked out longer after a single punch than someone who I've KO'd three times for example, but even when it's frustrating, it can be funny and oh so enjoyable.

There isn't much complexity to it, knowledge comes more down to timing than anything else. You have a punch / sprint punch, kick / drop-kick and a headbutt / roll. You can obviously grab too. The grabbing is based more on proximity of where your arms are, rather than you having control of each arm, punches will be carried by momentum, headbutts aided by your ability to grab people and drop kicks are either super intentional or super random.



Right now, there's a free battle pass event going on, I'm unaware of previous passes. Upon purchase of the game, you'll also progress a 100-tier track through normal play and normal XP gain, of which you'll get multiple currencies and cosmetics. Cookies are given out very fairly, many shop skins can be bought with those, NEMO bucks given out more sparingly, but enough to use on the gacha system to test your luck if you wish and they also throw egg coins at you for the gacha system too, so you have a chance to unlock things always, without buying into MTX.



See if you have a mate that owns it first, ask them if they're willing to invite you and let you try via the friend pass and give it a go. If not, it's fairly affordable for what it is and I think monetisation contrasted with the progression you get is more than fair in this day and age.

I think it's worth every penny personally. I've loved it, I encouraged my kids to play it with me and we've laughed at it, I've had a few funny session with my wife on it too and I've even played it with some of my good mates as well and it's been top-notch every time, even when I get frustrated.

TL;DR: The gameplay is a lot of fun and it's easy to pick up, but there are better, cheaper party games that come without the over-monetisation and live-service issues. Best to wait for a sale or choose a different game altogether.

The Good
I played the original demo back in October 2020, along with my friends. We all loved it; it was simple and lighthearted, with easy-to-learn mechanics, cute fuzzy animals, vibrant colours, and creatively designed maps. When I got playtest access, I was excited to learn that all these highlights had survived the long development process and had even been improved upon in some respects – new maps, new animals, new ways to customise your animal. Unfortunately, these were the only improvements over the original demo, and the only good things I have to say about the game.

The Bad
Monetisation
At 20 USD, Party Animals is comparable in price to other party games. Unlike other party games though, the upfront cost doesn't grant access to everything. Many items need to be purchased using one of 2 currencies - Cookies or Nemo Bucks - or randomly obtained from Eggs (their cute version of lootbox / gacha mechanics). Initially, I was under the impression that all these currencies could be obtained through regular gameplay real-money purchases, and so I treated it as a progression system (I have since learned that Nemo Bucks are only available for real-money purchases). Thinking that everything was tied to these 3 currencies, I was surprised on day 1 when I opened the shop to see a bundle for a new character that didn't appear in my locker - the ""Cabbage Dog"". It was only available through a bundle costing real money - 5.9 USD to be exact, or a little under 1/3 the price of the game. It was incredibly insulting after paying an upfront cost to be presented with content that was inaccessible without paying more.
I wasn't surprised that the time-limited playtest required an internet connection to play, but I wasn't expecting it from the full release. Unfortunately, there is offline mode. Want to look through your locker at the animals and cosmetics you’ve collected? You need to be connected to the internet. Having some friends over and want to play with them on your couch? You need to be connected to the internet. Going to a party and want to bring this game along? Better hope they’ll give you their internet password. Going on a road trip? Plane ride? Camping trip? Anywhere else with a lack of stable internet? Tough. You can’t play this game, even locally, until you’re reconnected.
Even if you're someone who is always connected to the internet, the online-only model makes me question the longevity of the game. Party games tend to be short-lived. They are the type of game you return to when you want mindless fun, not the type of game you play consistently. As such, party games tend to quickly lose their players. For a game that's online only, a consistently low playerbase is the indicator of an upcoming end-of-service. When that happens, say goodbye to your access, and any hope of playing your beloved game again.

Party Animals is a solid party game. Its controls and mechanics are well polished, its visuals are gorgeous, and each match is full of mindless fun. You will enjoy your time with it, especially if you have friends to play with. But enjoyment is not the same as being worth the price. The lack of an offline mode means that even your local games will be affected by high ping, and further means that you will lose access altogether if/when the servers get shut down. If you want to get it, wait for a sale... but there are plenty of party game alternatives available that can be played offline or online, and don’t charge for cosmetics.",Not Recommended,12,0

My initial review of this wonderful game was negative because my experience was very undesirable. However, upon gaining more playtime, looking at the developer's responses to feedback, and what other people say, I can confidently change this review to a positive one.

I'm a guy who has waited a long time for a lot of games. Elden Ring, Tears of the Kingdom, Persona 3 Reload, Pikmin 4, Baldur's Gate III, The Thousand-Year Door remake and the like... but I digress. Games aside, I have waited like the rest of you for this release. Sure, this game does have it's issues. There are complaints that certain regions, such as Australia, simply don't have any servers. The community's understanding was that this game would feature both online AND offline multiplayer. However, the developer's have since retracted and edited their statement, saying they have no plans to create an offline mode. I would highly, highly suggest they reconsider. This is an amazing title with a large following who has waited for a very long time- we're here to see it grow, not just stagnate several years down the line when online play is no longer supported.

Sure, some games have a gripping story, beautiful music, and some even the potential to romance intricate characters. Yadda yadda yadda, but can you knock the absolute cr*p out of them like this..? I didn't think so.

[TL;DR] In conclusion, this game is worth your money and your time. I hope that the games offline capabilities and online server availability will continue to grow so that more people can experience it both now and long down the line.

Yeah... No. Lying about multiple features and then sliding out of nowhere with a lootbox system with skins that cost more than the game isn't the way to go. If you like the gameplay of Gang Beast, it certainly does. Even better than Gang Beast, I'd say but the need for online when they've been saying it would be offline for years can't be overlooked.",Not Recommended,21 people found this review helpful 3,0

In it's curent state, I am very sad I say I can't recommend it. I always liked all the BTD series, and was really looking forward to playing this, but unfortunately, it is way too predatory with it's monetization system. You earn around 50-300 xp per match per tower, and you need 2000 xp for the least expensive tier 3 upgrades for the towers. I don't even want to look at how much it is for tier 4 or 5. The cash earning is decent given the amount needed, but the xp is way too low. Hopefully they will increase it in the near future, because I really want to be able to play this.

Edit after 1.0.2:

While now the game feels slightly more playable, with village not being as painful as before to level up as before for example, I still think this is slightly far off from what should be done. While you now consistently earn around 200 xp in each of your 3 towers per match, or even more if you only use 2/1 tower and win (unlikely but doable), and temporal buffs longer, it still probably takes around 40 hours just to max ONE tower.
While it's around 5 times less than before (it was around 200 hours according to my estimates), it still is waaaay too slow. I played for an hour and a half only using boat, alch and ninja, all of this while having a 2 hours boost to xp (so xp is multiplied by 2) and only got 1-2 tier 3s per tower. Again, it's definetly better than before, when those 2 hour boost didn't even exist as far as I was aware, but still takes too long. Keep in mind that I ONLY played those 3 towers and in around 15 matches and an hour and a half got around 4k xp on each with double xp active. And the tier 4s are 10k at least, with some up to 20k. Tier 5s are all over 20k, so the amount of grind needed for just 1 tower is really absurd.
I will probably keep playing because I like the actual game, but I really hope they improve the xp rate a bit more, as I won't actually recommend it to someone if that's not done.",Not Recommended,481,31

I hide in the closet, not daring to make a sound. ""Are you kidding me? Nothing gets past my bow!"" I hear, the distinct sound of two arrows being nocked and fired as the madman continues his killing spree. I cling onto the hope that my friends survived, but I know better. His arrows always find their mark.

I hear his voice again, ""I am Quincy, son of Quincy."", but this time it is a little bit closer, my heart begins racing as I hear his footsteps getting louder. ""has he found me?"" I wonder, shaking in fear. As the handle on the door turns, I am ready to accept my fate, but then I hear the voice of my best friend ring out ""Step away from the door!"" but it was too late, ""You can all have some!"" shouts the man, I hear the sound of a bowstring being drawn taunt, and I cover my ears as to not hear the blood curdling scream my friend lets out. This monster is unfeeling, he ensures his shots never kill instantly and lets the blood loss do the rest. I have unleashed this creature upon the world and now I must pay the price.

This game has fantastic bones underneath it all, but it's overshadowed by some MAJOR issues (listed below). Most of my qualms come from wanting this game to have serious competitive viability and Ninja Kiwi's decisions that hinder such viability. I'm confident the balance and bug issues will be fixed in time. Hopefully in a few months, the game will be playable. But for now it's just not fun :'( Scroll to the end for a TLDR.

1. The EXP system: This idea is a holdover from Battles 1 from a LONG time ago. However, the rate of EXP gain is entirely too small, even after it's been raised multiple times already. I'm over 100 hours into the game and still have not come CLOSE to unlocking all the tower upgrades. Also, locking late game viability behind a thousand-hour grind wall is absolutely terrible for any sort of ""competitive"" play. Given this game is exclusively PvP, that's not acceptable. Imagine playing Street Fighter for the first time and picking Ryu... but you can't throw fireballs, dragon punch, or hurricane kick until you've played Ryu for 75 hours. Then you still have to unlock all the moves for the other characters too at 75 hours each. Or imagine playing chess but your Rooks can only move vertically till you've played 50 hours and your Queen can only move diagonally backwards until 100 hours in. The reality is that ONLY cosmetics should be locked behind such a MASSIVE grind wall. Anything affecting actual game play should be available once you finish the tutorial. I understand the need to monetize, as Ninja Kiwi needs to eat and keep the lights on like the rest of us... but if they want this to be taken seriously as a ""competitive"" game then punishing players who can't play 40 hours a week is NOT the way to do it. I'd have gladly payed 20-30 bucks to buy the game with all the towers and upgrades unlocked.

2. Lack of Sandbox/Training Mode: This is surprising since BTD6 and Battles 1 both already have Sandbox mode for testing. How am I supposed to know which towers are good at solving which problems (if they're good at all) if I can't test in Sandbox? Again, this is abhorrent for competitive play. In the modern era, there NEEDS to be something like Training Mode in every competitive game out there. Otherwise the competitive community is seriously gimped.

3. Input Delay: I've played a lot of fighting games and have strong opinions on how netcode should be handled. Ninja Kiwi have implemented a Delay based system for Battles 2. On the surface, it makes sense. If the connection between 2 players is struggling, then put in a minor delay on every input to allow for a ""buffer"" time to compensate, this is common in fighting games. However, there's been a big push for Rollback netcode in fighting games. Rollback would not really work for a Tower Defense game, admittedly, but when you need to sell 3 farms to buy 5 bomb shooters and upgrade them all to tier 4 and activate their abilities before a swarm of DDTs blow by the screen, that ""minor"" delay makes it virtually impossible. I strongly prefer the Battles 1 net code that allowed you to micro (buy/sell/target/upgrade/etc) as fast as your fingers could, at the cost of occasional desync'ing issues. Right now you have to prepare for rushes BEFORE they happen, then when they don't happen you're behind. It really limits the ""strategy"" aspect of the game as very few things can be done as reaction. Everything must be preemptive, leading to very flowcharty redundant game play. Either you have 90% of the defense needed to defend a rush in advance and they don't rush you since already spent the money to defend, or you die because the input delay won't let you micro. UPDATE: The input delay now feels worse with 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 updates. I start to enjoy games as it's no the same dartling meta every game, then I try to boost and count to 12 before it activates but I'm already dead.

I won't even speak about the poor balancing or game breaking bugs here, as it's still a new game and new games take time to fix/balance. NK are people too, and nobody's perfect. I do believe NK is working hard to fix the bugs and balance issues, and the patches they have released so far have all been big steps in the right direction. My real complaints are the decisions they've made that cripple the notion of ""competitive"" play. Especially when NK mentioned something about potential eSports a while ago.

TLDR
-New game is new, and has new game problems (bugs/balance). I'm ok with that because they're working hard to fix these. (with 1.0.6 they've fixed many bugs and balance issues but now the input delay is WORSE)
-There are several major decisions that hinder competition and suggest a lack of understanding of the state of competitive gaming and ignorance of the struggles of past competitive games.",Not Recommended,118,0

Coming from BTD6, this was kind of a letdown. Admittedly, it has potential to surpass BTDB1 and BTD6, but as of right now, it is a P2W.

The xp and cash rewards from a victory is too little to actually be rewarding and unlock any upgrades Tier 3 and more, making it an incredibly grindy unlock system. This creates a very rigid meta for new players and there won't be much change or variety in early matches. Hardcore fans might not be so bothered by this, and may see it as a reason to play and get better at the game. Also, unlocking a reward chest by winning games can be exhausting for a players who can't win consistently due to oppressive metas.

It's buggy as well, no surprise for a game's initial launch but I'll state mine, and my friends' personal experience for posterity. We experienced a glitch in the final section of the tutorial where we had multiple copies of our Heroes but they didn't fire, this didn't affect the result of that battle since it was a tutorial fight but thought we should let the developers know.



1) 1 Free tower unlock for each category, so that new players can experiment with different builds, other than Dart, Bomb and Tack as a start. The tutorial's cash rewards aren't enough to even buy a Support tower, and barely get a Magic tower.

2) The tutorial should teach most damage types as it only explains energy damage can't pop purples. New players starting in BTDB2 may not know ice damage can't pop white bloons, explosion damage can't pop black bloons. With the tutorial teaching players how to place towers down, it has the opportunity to show damage types as well.

3) Social battles should still have some amounts of xp and cash rewards, alleviating the starting grind for friends. To mitigate this, social battles don't have to benefit from competitive bonuses like No Lives Lost and First Blood.

This is just my own personal opinion about BTDB2. It is very much still an enjoyable game but it is lacking.",Not Recommended,434,5

Game isn't bad but Ninja Kiwi did a terrible job with gaining tower XP in this game. Without paying for VIP it is absolutely ridiculous how many games you have to play to unlock towers. In total, for just 1 tower, to unlock all of its tier 5 upgrade you need to play at least a few hundred games with them. YES HUNDRED! and this is just for one tower. I really don't know what NK was thinking when they made the xp so ridiculous. It is genuinely disrespectful to the player base.",Not Recommended,136,6

It's a mobile game, it has all the hallmarks of one and it has the design of one. Its premium shop is predatory; Ninjakiwi is creating a problem and selling the solution. Bloons TD6 has you gain experience with each tower before you can upgrade it so its higher tiers can be accessed in a match, this works in that game because it's Co-op. You gradually become stronger and can take your team further. This however does not work in a PvP setting, especially when you can buy boosters and currency in the premium shop. The game is poorly optimised for PC and I get constant desynchronisation issues, the graphics stutter and the gameplay often lags behind with the health bars not properly showing the amount of HP a player has left.

The PC version does not have ads because apparently Ninjakiwi believes people who play on mobile are easily exploitable morons who never set foot outside of Plato's cave and thinks that these shenanigans would never fly with the clearly superior demographic of PC neckbeards.

At its core it's still a Bloons game. It will grant you some nostalgia of your childhood playing this in the back of your computer science class, maybe even some hiraeth if your time between then and now was particularly rocky. Sadly, you can pick only 3 towers and as you'll come to learn there are only 3 correct choices and all the others will have you eating mud the second the ZOMG class unlocks for both players. This may seem like a scathing review but keep in mind I'm recommending this. It's still a good way to spend an hour. The gameplay is fun and engaging enough and will keep you entertained for a little while.

They removed ranked matchmaking in the most recent update. Instead of gaining or losing trophies with wins or losses, you get paired in a group of 30 and only the top players of the week (by playtime, not wins) get to rank up.

So basically high level players have to play the game like a full time job to get into ranks with actual non brainless opponents, and newer players get smurfed on and have no chance to actually learn to play.

Very shallow attempt by NK to make players play every week and treat it like a job at the cost of annihilating any sort of competitive aspect to this game and refusing to let players play a videogame on their own time when they'd like to. They also kept the highest arena (an actual elo leaderboard) the same so the most serious and committed players don't complain about them nuking their whole game.

The worst part is that this newest update introduces a hero which makes the meta more open and exciting than most other patches of this game, but I have to play it against noobs who can't survive AI balloons, might as well go play BTD6 at that point.",Not Recommended,49,4

(if anyone still sees this, the game is probably good now, it has improved greatly - gamemodes are still lacking, but it isn't a mess like it used to be. but i still think it completely failed to live up to its predecessor)


January 7th update: The game has received one minor patch since 1.0.4, the game is the same as it was last month. Right now, the main concern of players has shifted from XP to the meta being boring, many towers being bugged to make them weaker/stronger than intended, and lag/desync. The next patch is still weeks away ( patch notes here ), and we'll be waiting longer than that for the addition of casual mode, universal xp and new maps. It's not really something to complain about, as the developers were understandably taking a break for the holidays, I just mean to say that the 1.0.4 section of this review is still valid. Although even if you don't mind the grind for xp, you might not enjoy playing against the same meta loadout (most meta towers are bugged which makes them much more powerful than they should be) in the majority of your games.


(Dec. 15) The XP gain was increased by a pretty large amount in this update. The rate at which you obtain it is much better, and f2p players shouldn't feel entirely hopeless while grinding anymore. The game is in a somewhat decent place compared to it's launch, and it might be worth a try if you thought it was too unforgiving before. Some people are perfectly fine with the game as it is right now, and I can understand some of that.

However, I still can't recommend the game in it's current state. The system is still fundamentally flawed and does not belong in a competitive game. Trying new tower loadouts shouldn't be as punishing as it once was, but an increase in xp doesn't change the fact that attempting to level up different towers is going to result in unbalanced matches. The amount of XP itself isn't the main problem, it's just another factor that makes the entire system more frustrating.

The state of the game for f2p, as of 1.0.4, isn't nearly as terrible as before. Keep in mind that the amount of games you need to play (and probably lose) to suitably level up a 2-2-2 tower is already quite brutal as a VIP, and of course for f2p it's much more punishing. Though with the recent xp increase, the grind is much more bearable, and there are plenty of f2p players who were able to cruise up to BFB-ZOMG arenas with just a few tier 4's. If you enjoy a grind, the game can certainly be enjoyable as a f2p.

On December 13th, NK's co-founder released an official statement reflecting on the game's first two weeks after launch, and how they plan to improve it. They are planning two improvements to the XP system, those being and These changes are precisely what many were hoping to see, and I'm so glad that these were announced sooner rather than later. I can confidently say that these two changes should vastly improve the community's opinion on the game. Universal XP solves the primary issue with the xp system, that being the fact that you are required to actively use the tower you need xp for in every game. If universal xp is done right, the game should eventually be more friendly to beginners and players in high arenas alike.

So, at least we know the developers weren't scamming us here, it was just a series of stupid decisions. Now that NK has confirmed that the xp is getting major changes, I'm hoping that it will start to feel somewhat on par with battles 1 within a year or so. The question is, do we bash them for releasing a bad product, or praise them for improving that bad product? Well, that's up to you. The game is beginning to go the right direction, so I'm happy. (P.S. thanks to the people who awarded this)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



there's no way the game can stay like this for long because the system is just so poor. the monetization was done so bad it's not even funny. seriously, it would be better if they put a price tag to instantly unlock all towers and upgrades, because even though that would make most players quit, (just as the current system is doing) they would at least get a decent amount of money spent by hardcore fans. right now, the game is pay to win, but even the people who DO pay still feel as though it isn't enough. VIP just isn't a large enough increase and you still have to grind hundreds and hundreds of games if you want tier 5's.

there is no skill involved here. even if you and your opponent both own VIP, you'll still be on separate playing fields because grinding xp for a tower you haven't used much will always be disadvantageous. I can't think of a way they could possibly fix this terrible design without removing it completely. what kind of pvp game implements a system that requires you to play thousands of games, just to be able to have a fair fight? It's so poorly executed, I don't know how they thought this was okay.

what happens if I'm in a high arena, and the one strategy that I've been using isn't working so well anymore? well, All I have for the other towers are 2-2-2, so the only option I get there is to start surrender farming - because it's not like anyone can get by with tier 2 towers in the 60+ trophy arenas. This completely forces you to always stick to the meta, unless you want to lose 30 times in a row while mindlessly spamming the same tower. And since every single tower has it's own separate xp pool, players are encouraged even more to continuously use the same loadout every time. There's no diversity in strategies, and that makes things really stale. Realistically, you won't ever unlock every upgrade, so there won't ever be a competition that's actually fair.

They could monetize cosmetics, emotes, gamemodes, guilds (if they plan to have those) and maybe even the hero skins, and players would be happy because none of those things are crucial to gameplay. But instead they monetized XP... which requires you to pay money AND to grind. On top of that, they made hero cosmetics free......... how does that make any sense?

Even if the possible solutions presented in this review were horrible and poorly thought out, they would likely still improve the mess that the XP system is right now. The game will surely be fixed eventually, but it really needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Increasing the xp isn't a fix, and it's clear that the game won't last so long if they keep it this way.

It's sad because I really enjoy everything else about the game. If all upgrades were unlocked by default and everything else cost real money, I would happily play this game all day. For now, it's not worth it.",Not Recommended,226,10

It's a good game, but before you play, know it's predatory marketing

Ninja Kiwi has always handled micro-transactions well, even in the original battles. You COULD purchase micro transactions to unlock tower upgrades quicker, but it was fairly easy to unlock all the tower upgrades legitimately and very quickly if you knew what you were doing. The problem with this game is... you can pay a MONTHLY subscription (or even TRI-MONTHLY) to get THREE TIMES the rewards of a normal player. Three. Times. It's just so poorly done. And the thing is, battles 1 had something similar, but it was a 5 dollar one-time fee and you got essentially new game modes, which, while you COULD make more currency that way, it was pretty much fine. This, however, is just such a horrible business practice. I'm sure they're making bank from it, and the game is fun, as shown by my playtime, but I can't recommend YOU to play it.

The worst part is that after EVERY battle there is an option to multiply your earnings by 3 by upgrading to vip. It is an option. At the end. Of every. Battle. If you click it, it brings you to a page within the game to pay for VIP, which is just asking for little timmy to take mommy's credit card and get bloons vip.

It just doesn't feel right when I'm in a ranked match and I lose because the other guy has a better hero than me, or more upgrades than me, because he's a ""VIP"" lol. Most of the games I lose I usually just excuse as ""ah, didn't know that could happen, I'll adjust to this information"" but.. sometimes I lose because the other person payed real life money, and that sucks. You can get to the point where you max out everything, however it takes exponentially longer in this game than the first one, which just sucks to see as a battles veteran.
I have 17 hours in the game and have much less than half the upgrades unlocked. Probably even less than a quarter.

You may ask; how can you avoid micro transactions for a free game on pc? and here's the answer:
you can't. What you CAN do is make micro transactions purely cosmetics or hide game modes behind a paywall. Free games need to be free-to-play, pay-to-have-fun, while still being fun to play normally, EXACTLY like how battles 1 is. Source: every successful free pc game ever

TL;DR
In conclusion, it's a good game, and if you have some money to drop on it to get that extra edge or just don't mind a lot of micro-transactions/losing due to pay-to-win mechanics, it's a good time. It's even fun for me, someone who doesn't exactly wanna pay like 5 bucks a month for a game I might log on to play a few hours every few days.",Not Recommended,99,5

The game as of now is unfun for non-VIP players. XP progression is flawed in so many ways, 20 minute match going late game and you get less than 1000XP for each tower. If you use different towers, you're punished by the XP system as a percentage of XP is given to the most towers on the screen. The more variety of towers you use, the lesser and lesser the XP. I've lost all my motivation to play this game, going against VIP's that have meta towers with the meta upgrades unlocked while I’m stuck not even half way done. There are so many towers in the game, it's impossible to unlock T5. If NK want to make money, sell me the game without micro-transactions affecting the progression and balance of the game, so I know I’m competing on a fair playing field. The game could be so fun if upgrades were much fairer to achieve, but right now I don't have the energy to face a meta strat when I'm levelling up towers like glue and ice.

The real problem in this game is the balance, the reason you see everyone using the same towers is because this game has limited options for composition.

The first game worked well because you were allowed 4 towers, but in this game youre only allowed 3 towers with a hero, and a hero DOES NOT make up for a missing tower, a hero is only there to support your towers with abilities or passive buffs (Gwen, Striker) every once in a while, but it still doesnt make up for the missing tower slot. Because of this, if you arent using a Village, Alch, Banana Farm, or any combination of the 3 in your loadout, then you are at a MASSIVE disadvantage at various stages of the game, especially later on when Blimps come into play, there are loadouts that straight up cant compete without a slot used up for a primary buff tower, which severely hurts composition diversity and synergy, because in order to survive you have to use the meta towers since they are the strongest by themselves as long as you buff them (example: Tack, Alch, Village). This is a problem with the amount of towers that are NOT viable, they are simply too limited to work without sacrificing a slot for a buff.

The diverse strategies and synergies of BTD are disincentivized. I think that in order for this game to truly be fun like the first game, they need to let us use 4 towers again, with a hero, for 5 total slots, so that you have the option of supporting more of your towers without such heavy sacrifice. That MAY sound like a lot at first but trust me it would help the balance of this game a lot in the future if players were actually able to use the tower compositions that they WANT to use, instead of tower compositions that they HAVE to use in order to survive. It's not even like this will stop the meta from existing, but at least players who want to use other strats will be at a more even playing field, instead of dying instantly on round 12/26.

At the end of the day, this is a PvP game, and arent PvP games supposed to be yknow, balanced? at least a little bit?


(Also, grouped bloon rush economy at the start of the game is too strong, an important part of this game is First Blood because it puts you in the lead for sudden death. There are too many situations in this game where you literally cant defend the grouped bloons without Tack Shooter, so I think these early game groups should be removed or their sending speed decreased)",Not Recommended,68 people found this review helpful 3,3

While EXP is extremely grindy at the moment (as everyone has been complaining about), I'm hopeful they'll fix it quickly, and once they do this will be a very solid sequel to the original game. If you dug the first one (as well as BTD6) then this is definitely worth a shot. I'm a bit upset that there seems to be no unranked mode (which will make grinding towers more annoying since you have to use the tower in a weak state to actually earn its upgrades) but I think I can look past it for now.",Recommended,75,0

Absolutely love Bloons and Ninja Kiwi, if you check my profile you'll see I've got over a thousand hours in Bloons TD6 (I have a problem I know), but Jesus. Battles 2 is so busted, and the release was absolutely rushed. The game constantly crashes even when BTD6 and everything else runs fine on my PC, if opponents disconnect sometimes the round just... Stops. The game doesn't end, no one wins or loses, but bloons stop sending and rounds stop moving forward, so you can sit there making income, building towers selling doing whatever you please.... But with absolutely nothing happening until you forfeit and lose out on rewards and ranks. And the upgrade system, please excuse my french but holy mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥, what in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HELL is this? I'd prefer to get XP by having a cheese grater shoved up my ass and turned in to spaghetti. You get to yellow stadium and suddenly you're utterly screwed and have to level up every single monkey one at a time (IF YOU'RE LUCKY) because the upgrade system is not only so immensely slow it can take a dozen games just to get all the tier 3 upgrades for a tower (if you're lucky and win all dozen of those games that is) but because of how it's split depending on what you buy in the game that means you have to spam god awful towers if you weren't spending the entirety of Red Bloon Stadium just grinding XP on your crap towers later on (which absolutely doesn't work considering with 3 tower slots, losing out on one to terrible towers AND trying to balance greed/defense/XP investment = you're gonna lose a solid 50% more of the time atleast). And due to this horrible leveling system people get in to yellow stadium without good/reliable de-camo options like camo village or bloontonium reactor (normal support sub works fine for smaller rushes but is way too slow to de-camo massive camo purple bloonsends, trust me I've tried double intel support subs and with just a few queues of purple camo bloonsends at LEAST half of'em just fly right by the sub like nothing happened depending on the map) and just instantly lose to round 12 camo purple rushes or some other form of cheap bs that's not on the fault of the players, but on Ninja Kiwi for constructing a game mechanic system so immensely busted that your only options for decently countering certain strategies is by dumping all your money in to de-camo (assuming you even have it) and praying your opponent isn't smart enough to save up a couple income ticks so they can balls to the wall spam camo purples or camo leads. Or better yet, doesn't see that you're doing the smart thing by saving up for de-camo and thus most likely lacking in proper earlier game defenses and just blasts you with whatever you're weak against (thankfully though thats a gigabrain strat that takes a LOT of focus/wit to pull so I've only been slapped with bloonboosted regrow zebras while relying on a bomb shooter cuz I'm busy trying to level up boomerang twice)

Honestly there's a lot of stuff that's really subjective to me, personally I feel like income should be increased slightly to make early games and anti-cheese ""instantly end 80% of games with this ONE WEIRD TRICK!"" strategies juust a bit harder, but the one thing that isn't subjective is that BTDB2 is utterly busted from a bug standpoint and a basic ""overlooked issues in the core game design"" standpoint, and should have had way the Hell more QA testing. That or at LEAST make it clear this is an early access game, because in the name of Guy Fieri our Lord and Savior this does not take me to flavor town.

update: Ninja Kiwi has decided to solve the problem of rounds constantly disconnecting and just stopping by automatically forcing you to lose if the game desyncs. Which is lots of fun. Boy do I love clappin mad cheeks and suddenly getting ranked down and wasting my time because Ninja Kiwi decided to bone me instead of just neutralizing the game like most online games do when their servers are hosted by a toaster :)))))",Not Recommended,128,1

Before the 4.0 update, I really enjoyed the game. I am a casual player, and I could join the game at any point, play a few casual games, and leave and come back months later. After the 4.0 update, I feel like I can't play the game anymore. The 4.0 update completely overhauled the battle system, entirely removing the casual play option, and forced entirely ranked play. There is now no way to play the game without it being a constant challenge, and I see this as a serious issue for new and casual players. If you aren't sure how to play the game, or play for fun from time to time, you will be forced to play against players much more experienced and competitive than you. It isn't fun. I can no longer pick the game up and put it down at any time, and the games that I do have are always against players who seemingly don't want to have long and fun games, but they just want to win. I don't even care whether I win or lose, as long as the rounds are fun I will enjoy the game, but the forced ranked matching system removes the possibility for me to do so. I tried learning how to play with Etienne, the new hero, but I simply couldn't because every game was competitive and there simply wasn't a mode where I could experiment with the new hero. The game feels hostile now towards new or returning players, and being in that category, I simply cannot play this game. It's better to just uninstall it and free up space on my computor. I absolutely loved this game before, and I know I still would if they hadn't changed what wasn't broken. There was already a system for ranked play, but there was also the option for casual play, so all they really did was remove casual play and add a hero. I truly hope they reverse this update, but knowing game developers, they probably won't. If you are a sweaty, hardcore BTD Battles 2 player, then enjoy your sweaty game and give it all the wonderful ratings you want. If you are a returning casual player, give it a try for yourself, but I suspect you will experience the same dissappointment that I did. If you are a new player, or if you are looking into buying this game, I would highly recommend rethinking your choice, and unless if you are also a sweaty gamer that likes being competitive and you want to do so on a funny monkey game, I recommend saving your money. Go spend it on BTD 6, or another game that is still friendly to new players.",Not Recommended,32,0

BTD Battles that came out 6-10 years ago contained a lot more modes and freedom of play and replay value compare to this BTD Battles 2 which for some reason they decided to put all focus on shop and micro-transactions.

After playing 380 hours of first BTD Battles, 500 hours of BTD 6 and being a huge addict on Ninja Kiwi games I can't even spend more then 4 hours in total on BTD Battles 2 and not hate it or get bored of it and quit.

I like Bloons TD games. I like this game. However I grow tired with the win in each match being the same thing because of the lack of efficiency of towers. There should not be only one way to win a match, which would be by sending specific bloon types on specific rounds just to get the win. There should be enough efficient tower base to allow for more strategy. not just the same 3 boring towers and hero every match. And each side trying to send the bloons to kill the other faster. When it comes down to the person who pressed the button the fastest that is a failing of the game not the strategy or the skills of the player.",Recommended,35,0

Put hundreds of hours into the first one, it's a fun concept but they hamstring the fun of the game by making you unlock levels for the towers. In a competitive multiplayer game, it's less than fair to allow someone to win games simply because they've spent more time and earned more experience to unlock upgrades for towers. The first game had an elegant solution in the form of new/special game modes, like random trio where both players got the same towers and had all unlocks available regardless of progress. If they add game modes with this mechanic, the game will be a lot more fun overall.",Not Recommended,68,7

This game had a TERRIBLE launch, but thankfully the devs actually made this into a fun and addicting game over time by listening to player feedback, which is really amazing. Definitely worth to try, especially since it's free.

The gameplay is solid and versatile, and is incredibly rewarding. The game is balanced for the most part, and you always see people using different loadouts which is really refreshing compared to seeing a same ""meta"" being used by everyone. I'm excited to see what the future has in store for this game, it has a ton of potential.

Honestly would not recommend to waste your time on this game right now.
- Netcode is horrible, in about 40% of my matches someone ""loses connection"" and is forced to surrender. I have never seen this in any other ""big"" game.
- It contains horrendously predatory marketing while offering extremely little in terms of balancing the game, they simply add more paid content every update. Some upgrades have been bugged since release or so horrendously bad in the game that I refuse to believe they have been tested even once (Spectre, Apache Prime, Flying Fortress, Sun God).
- If you surrender a couple of matches in a row you will automatically get shadow-banned for ""boosting"". There is no warning regarding the shadow-ban. It does not say anywhere that you are banned and for what reason, and there is no way to repeal the ban.
- The grind is weeks long and the Elo system is unbalanced. If you win their your first few games in the ""Hall of Masters"" you can become the No.2 ranked player worldwide, over players with hundreds of wins.
+ The only good thing about the game is the Random Quad gamemode, as it offers a break from tediously playing against the same tactic that the developers refuse to nerf and allow for some more interesting gameplay.",Not Recommended,72,0

Do you see banana man
Hopping over on the white-hot sand
Here he come with some for me
Freshly taken from banana tree (one, two, three, four)
Banana man, me want a ton
Gimme double and a bonus one
Gimme more for all me friends
This banana flow will never end
Do you want a banana?
Peel it down and go, mm-mm-mm-mm
Do you want a banana?
This banana for you
Tonight, we dance around the flame
Then we get to play spirit game
Spirit names, we shout out loud
Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud
All the songbirds in the tree
Chant a tune to let the spirits free
Then we see them in the night
Spirits jumping by fire light
Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana?)
Peel it down and go, mm-mm-mm-mm
Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana?)
This banana for you
Look you, you too uptight, you know
You could laugh and kick it back and go (wee!)
But without a rhythm or a rhyme
You do not banana all the time
Fly away from city on the run
Try to make a little fun
Look you, come to the bungalow
African't you tell me told you so
Don't you love the bumping of the drum?
Make you shake until the bum go numb
Let de bongo play you 'til you drop
This banana never stop (never stop, never stop)
Forget all your troubles and go with the flow
Forget about whatever you may never know
Like whether whatever you are doing is whatever you should
And whether anything you do is ever any good
And then forget about banana when it stick in your throat
And when it make you wanna bellow, but you stuck in a choke
And forget about the yellow from the beckoning man
Who make you take another one and make a mock of your plan
Bungalay, bungalow
Make up your mind and tell me no
(Shh)
Well, it's nine o'clock, and it's getting dark
And the sun is falling from the sky
I've never left so early, and you may wonder why
Tomorrow morning on the plane
No banana make you go insane
Floating back to busy town
No banana make you want to frown

Do you want a banana?

UPDATED UPDATE:
Although I don't really play Battles 2, I can't deny that it's in a much better state now then it used to be at release. Ninja Kiwi has actually done a decent job of fixing the core issues the game suffered at launch.

(Old Review)
UPDATE:
They changed XP gain and it is actually a bit better now. Core issue still remains that VIP makes this game P2W. Like how exactly is it fair that I'm fighting people with multiple Tier 5 towers in Lead dungeon while I can't even afford any Tier 4 towers?
____________________________

This game starts out fun but as soon as you hit Yellow Stadium everything starts to go downhill very fast.
You start this game with barely any tower or upgrades and unlocking anything takes ages. You start this game with barely any towers that actually detect camo bloons so when you actually reach Yellow Stadium all hell breaks loose. The entire game revolts around just rushing round 12 with camo bloons. You can't defend them and there's a solid 50% chance your opponent cant either because this game starts you out without any towers that actually detect camo and can pop a lot of bloons at the same time. Now here's where you can buy VIP and get 3x rewards every match to unlock everything at an ungodly pace meaning you get situations where you have to fight players with tier 4 towers while you only have tier 2 and maybe 1 or 2 tier 3 upgrades unlocked. You can't do anything about them, you are just destined to lose. Nk couldnt even keep their promise to not make this game grindy or p2w. Massive disappointment.",Recommended,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0,0

Played it for 7.5 hours now.
The XP-System to unlock more upgrades for all the towers is really bad.
Even with the VIP Pass (which costs 4,99 --> gives you XP-Boost after every game for the towers you used -P2win btw) it takes an eternity to unlock all the upgrades. So if you play against a VIP Player you lose 99,9% of the time because you can't win mid/late game with low tier towers against a player who already has tier 4 towers. After 7.5 hours I finally unlocked 1 !!!! Tier 4 Upgrade for Boats. It's way too slow!
I love Bloons games, don't get me wrong because I have 1,7k hours in BTD6, but my recommandation is to wait until they change/balance the xp system. 2/10. Really sad about this one.",Not Recommended,23 people found this review helpful 0,0

Played for an hour an a half. Could only unlock 2 new towers and i'm not even close to getting a tier 3 upgrade in any tower. I couldn't catch any flaws in gameplay yet, but playing with default towers is painful. Idk how many hours are needed to max all towers, but it's considerably longer than in btd battles, in which you could get all of them in a week of casual playing, and a solid build in within an hour or two of playing.
Overall, progress is too slow, it's impossible to play with a non upgraded tower, and you can't upgrade it without using it. I understand how they tried to mimic this mechanic from btd 6, but it doesn't work in a competitive game in which you can only use 3 towers.
There is a lot of grind needed to start playing this game at a competitive level, and if they don't fix it, I guess I will stick with the simple yet perfectly balanced og btd battles.",Not Recommended,50,0

In it's current state this game can feel pay to win at times but the system of separating players among different arenas based on their number of wins limits this to some degree. All players within the same arena will in theory have similar access to the number of towers and upgrades for those towers. This creates a nice and gradual sense of progression as with better towers and upgrades matches will last longer and go into later rounds more often as you progress through the arenas. In practice this is still true but not always. With the nature of a game like this which requires grinding to even compete at higher levels, paired with the option to speed up this grinding with VIP, you'll often encounter opponents who are either far more equipped to last longer into the later rounds due to having more or better upgrades available, or who are far less equipped as they are grinding exp for one or two of their towers which doesn't have as many upgrades unlocked. The arena system does limit this to some extent, but many players find it easier to grind in lower arenas and as a result purposefully attempt to stay within in them. Nowhere is this more true than the earlier arenas and the penultimate arena as once the final arena is reached, there is no way to return to any of the previous ones.
The actual battles that are the game's namesake are quite fun despite this however. The fun and strategy behind each match comes from knowing you and your opponents weaknesses, exploiting theirs, and minimizing yours. Even if in theory your opponent should win because they have better towers with better upgrades, keen observation and your knowledge of what their towers' limits are can still allow you to squeeze out a win. The opposite is also true so it's never a good idea to underestimate any opponent or their defense. It keeps you on your toes and commands your attention in the same way the original BTD Battles did but doesn't contain all of the unique, and sometimes controversial, elements from it. When compared I'd say it's a more ""pure"" experience than current BTD Battles. Even so I hope that in the future some elements from that game make their way into this game.
Overall if you were a fan of the original or the more competitive game modes of normal Bloons Tower Defense I'd highly recommend this game. There aren't many problems with it but those few problems are obvious and can easily be fixed in future updates. Ninja Kiwi has already shown some interest in making the game more fun and balanced with an update within the first few days of release. If development is anything like development of BTD 6 then we can expect balance changes almost as often as with that game.",Recommended,13,0

All the main glitches from launch have been fixed, it's strange the game still isn't gaining players. I rate it 9 out of 10.

Graphics: completely new models and art for everything from btd6, very nice 3D look.
Replayability: literally infinite, you can try out the constant new updates and modes and climb the arenas to become the best.
Difficulty: have fun in gamemodes with other players of varying skill or play ranked battles against people around your level. You will almost always be paired against people of similar skill to yourself in ranked battling.
Bugs: Most major bugs from launch have been fixed and there are no real problems in this category anymore.
Overall rating: Very cool epic skroom broom vroom skirt 9/10

Needs more balancing tho

Still too grindy, even after the patch. Even with every tower having the first two upgrades in every path be free from the start now, its still easy to lose because of the match making putting you up against people who simply have more upgrades than you.

The actual gameplay is a bit boring and buggy too. You basically have to use tacks if you want to win, or you're basically crippling yourself. The only sends worth using for actual attacks are camo purples, and DDTs. Don't bother with any other ones outside of income. And even then, the game sometimes just screws you over, by just not having your opponent lose lives, despite leaking and the bar even flashing. Lost several games because of this and the fact people are just getting all the top upgrades and just end up outlasting me because I'm limited to 222 on everything.

While I'm sure the game will improve in due time, I simply cannot recommend this right now. Its simply too shallow, and not fun.",Not Recommended,30 people found this review helpful 0,0

As a long time fan of the BTD series, it disappoints me that a game with so much potential has so many anti consumer practices. This game is incredibly P2W, making it horrible for new players, and the newest change to arenas makes it so a player with a 90% win rate is unable to progress and reach better opponents, and puts a player who wins 30 games and loses 100 ahead of a player who wins 30 games and loses 5 (without a 10 game win streak at any point). For the beginner experice, I believe if you started off with all the monkeys tier 5 and all the heros, this game would still make ninja kiwi absurd amounts of money with all the cosmetics and the club membership. New players must either spend insane amounts of money or grind many many hours in order to have a chance against their opponents. In general multiplayer games that let you gain competitive advantages by spending money are extremely anti consumer and should never be supported financially.

TLDR: P2W, rewards playing more games rather then winning games, and punishes people who have a life with demoting inactive players. Horrible practices ruining a game that could so easily be so good",Not Recommended,12,0

I should caveat this bad review with: I still play it occasionally and it can definitely be fun, but it gets frustrating quickly and needs some work. There is potential here and I will change this if I see it worked on.

I'd really like to recommend this game, but the microtransactions are oppressive and the servers are sketchy at best. I was holding off on this review until I started disconnecting from games taking an instant loss (with a fully functioning internet connection).

The matchmaking also doesn't seem to take into account any amount of accumulated experience so you're likely to match with people who have many times your exp and therefore substantially better towers.",Not Recommended,7 people found this review helpful 0,0

- Exp gain is unfair to anyone without VIP (I own VIP and it literally skyrockets progression)
- Half the towers in the game are literally not used
- Game randomly crashes at stupid times and its your fault if the game crashes, you lose trophies even if you get back into game 20 seconds after the crash

This game has left me alone. I have no one. This game has brought ruin to every relationship i have ever had. My family has disowned me, my friends have excommunicated me, and even my dog refuses to be near me after playing this game. I am orphaned and i will now starve to death on the cold concrete while thinking about where everything went wrong. Was it the level where you had to stand on platforms and time your jumps, causing everyone to scramble for the edge in a flurry just to die inevitably? Maybe it was the level with the buttons, the simplest level where all you have to do is jump. JUMP FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! But no, the difficulty of leaping over a single red button is too hard for most people with an iq under 100. This game has caused me so much pain, sorrow and grief. My life was ruined for a measly $4.99.

PICO PARK: A Vision of Future Military Training

As a seasoned military drill sergeant, I am always on the lookout for innovative methods to foster camaraderie, communication, and collaboration among my recruits. Recently, I stumbled upon a video game that has proven to be an unexpected yet highly effective tool in achieving these goals - PICO PARK.

At first glance, PICO PARK may seem like just another cute and quirky indie game, but don't let its charming exterior fool you. This cooperative local/online multiplay action puzzle game offers a unique set of challenges that require strategic thinking, quick reflexes, and impeccable teamwork. With support for up to eight players, each level presents a fresh set of obstacles and puzzles that demand constant consultation and coordination among team members.

During our initial sessions with PICO PARK, I observed noticeable improvements in my recruits' ability to work together towards a common objective. For instance, during one particularly challenging level, we encountered a maze filled with moving walls and hidden traps. To navigate through this labyrinth successfully, the recruits had to communicate effectively, sharing their observations and strategizing in real-time. It was heartening to see them adapt quickly to changing circumstances, demonstrating remarkable resilience and resourcefulness under pressure.

Another level featured color-coded switches that needed to be activated simultaneously by multiple players. Initially, there were some missteps and confusion, but after several attempts, the recruits began working together more seamlessly, dividing tasks based on individual strengths and abilities. Watching them coordinate their movements and actions reminded me of a well-oiled machine, where every component played a crucial role in driving the system forward.

One memorable moment occurred when we reached a stage with disappearing platforms over a bottomless pit. Falling off meant starting over, so maintaining balance and supporting one another became paramount. In true soldier fashion, they devised a human chain formation, passing along keys and other essential items while ensuring no one fell victim to the treacherous abyss below. Their unwavering focus, trust, and determination shone brightly throughout this trial, reinforcing the notion that success hinges not only on personal skills but also collective effort.

Beyond strengthening team dynamics, PICO PARK has also helped improve problem-solving skills and creativity among my recruits. Each level introduces novel mechanics and twists that force players to rethink their strategies and explore alternative solutions. By encouraging lateral thinking and experimentation, PICO PARK provides an engaging platform for honing cognitive abilities in a fun, low-stakes environment.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend PICO PARK as a valuable addition to any team-building or leadership development program. Its clever design, diverse challenges, and emphasis on cooperation make it an ideal choice for fostering unity, communication, and critical thinking among group members. My recruits and I have greatly benefited from our time spent playing PICO PARK, and I am confident that others will experience similar rewards from incorporating this exceptional game into their training regimens.


PICO PARK excels at fostering teamwork and communication, making it an excellent addition to any team-building or leadership development program. Through engaging cooperative gameplay, players develop stronger bonds, enhance problem-solving abilities, and learn to adapt in dynamic situations – all vital skills for successful military training and beyond.",Recommended,102,0

But after a few hours of this game with those men who I call my ""homies,"" or ""compadres;"" I've learned that even the kindest hearts may be bound to truly twisted, hopeless minds. Aerospace engineers who can't figure out how to get off my head, computer scientists who can't block a lazer, and then there's me, a lowly humanities major stuck in the middle of the chaos, screaming for respite from the hopeless maelstrom of subtly acrid viscous stupidity that spun each and every one of these hopeless fools into a depth of fury not yet witnessed in this several years of friendship.",Recommended,67,3

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Recommended,161,3

""Pico Park"" is the game that will have you and your friends laughing until your sides hurt. It's a co-op puzzle game that requires teamwork, communication, and a lot of patience. But most of all, it's an absolute blast to play.

The game is surprisingly challenging, but in a good way. Each level feels like a new adventure, full of surprises and obstacles that will keep you on your toes. But at the same time, the game is incredibly silly, with characters that look like they're straight out of a cartoon.

The co-op mode is where the game really shines, as you'll need to work together to solve puzzles, use your different skills, and overcome challenges. But even if you mess up, it's hard not to just laugh it off and try again. You'll make some great memories trying to solve each level as a team.

If you're looking for a solo game experience, this might not be the game for you. While you can play by yourself, it's really designed to be played with others. Also, some of the levels may feel a bit unfair, as mistakes can result in having to start all over again.

Overall, ""Pico Park"" is a gem of a game that's perfect for a night with your friends. You'll laugh, you'll rage, and you'll make some unforgettable co-op memories along the way. Just be prepared for the occasional ""accidental"" push or shove.",Recommended,27,0

Don't be put off by the fact that this is an indie title with simplistic art style from a small developer. Perfect Heist 2 is a hidden gem carried by great execution, excellent performance and many great design choices that went into it.

Contrary to what you might think from the bank robbery theme, Perfect Heist 2 is not a guns-blazing-cops-vs-robbers team based shooter but rather a refreshing take on a team and class-based social deception game. The gameplay works very well for uncoordinated strangers but also scales well into advanced teamwork. While the game does have voice chat support, it's optional and no necessary to use (and in fact I never heard anyone on voice comms it in public matches, most people just use the chat).

What makes Perfect Heist 2 so special is the fact that the maps are full of NPCs walking around, going about their day. Your task is to blend in, use all kinds of distractions to have the cops chase around while the robbers slowly plunder the bank.

With default server settings teams are at more robbers vs fewer cops. For this reason robbers will only have one life each for the round, while cops get to respawn a limited number of times - unless they shoot a civilian, in which case they get suspended (means die for good for the round). As a result the robbers have a hard time winning open shootouts and therefore rely on stealth, deception and backstabbery by blending into the crowd of NPCs that populate the map.
Some of these NPCs are citizens, others are bank employees. These NPC types have areas assigned in where they are allowed to walk around. A citizen will not walk into the employee-only area and employees will not walk into the public area. To work around this you have to steal a disguise by knocking out a NPC and taking their clothing, in similar fashion to the Hitman series of games. Combined with walking around to act like an NPC and the fact that cops are not allowed to gun down innocents this makes for a very enjoyable social deception aspect.
I had a few moments in which I got nearly caught, walked around a corner, turned 180° and walked right back at someone who then wasn't sure if it's me or an NPC, since they are all over the place.

The real charm lies in the fun interactibles on maps. The goal is to steal money and carry it to a van. Carried money spawns a visible backpack on your back with money trailing out behind you. This means you either run for your life to drop off the money - or you try to sneak it out creatively.
Money comes from various sources. Some of it can be found as jewelry in glass-covered cabinets (smashing glass makes a noise, unless you have a class that can do it silently), some of it can be gained by hacking ATMs (which then show a red ""HACKED"" label and quietly drop a bundle of cash you can pick up or leave on the floor for a later attempt at picking it up), some of it comes from vaults (which you either have to blow open, drill your way into or hack your way into), some it comes from minor pickups like cash bundles or ""secret files"" you can find around the bank and the rest can be obtained through various class-related mechanics (such as hacking computers to install crypto miners, which give you passive income over time, or putting down a literal money printer hidden in a corner and letting it slowly print out cash you can collect later.).
You can set fire to plants to distract cops and open fire doors, you can sneak a bomb case into the bank to blow up the vault, you can blow up walls with various placeable explosives or use a drill to quietly cut through a wall or ceiling, you can climb on the roof, or climb into vents, or break windows to toss money out to pick up outside later, you can place all kinds of gadgets and use all kinds of abilities. The amount of mayhem in and around the bank is enormous and it makes it such a joy to keep the opposing team on their toes constantly.

What keeps the game fresh is the class and ability variety. You pick a class and really have to play its active skill and passive skill to your advantage. Some of these are pretty specific while others have more generic utility. Some classes can quickly climb up walls without making a sound, others can place guns or armor vests. Some can carry tiny amounts of money without spawning a visible money bag on the back, others can install protective or malicious software on computers. Some throw grenades, some shoot rockets, some use drones or bomb vehicles they can spawn, others can place walls that act like TV screens and broadcast a static image of the room behind (without showing any players, so they can about unseen). Some can obtain hidden information about the opposing team (such as class or locations), others place turrets, barbed wire or blockades. Some spawn VIP NPCs to protect (or to assassinate for rewards), others have a grappling hook. Some can set fire to block of hallways, others can set smoke or lethal gas traps. There are so many fun ideas put into classes, it creates ever changing variety and weird situations.

Perfect Heist 2 is built on the Unreal Engine. As the game uses a low-poly artstyle it runs exceptionally well, even on medicore hardware. Since it's Unreal, the netcode is also excellent for a gunplay oriented game. The amount of clutch shootouts you can have, especially unexpectedly when someone suddenly pulls a gun, is insane.
The game has a default FPS limit of 240 (which it easily reaches on a decent gaming CPU/GPU combo) but you can edit an .ini file to set the value to anything you want.

The only downside is the fact that the game is reliant on custom server settings to make each map enjoyable. That means an inexperienced host/admin might set up awful rules about respawns, required amount of money stolen or round timers that simply do not work very well with the particular map or play count. In this case you either have to use the server voting system and hope people vote to change it - or host your own server (out of the game on your computer or by using the official dedicated server tool on a machine of your choice).

The game has a map editor and Steam Workshop support, so given enough time and dedication, there will be ever more maps and content available.

All in all Perfect Heist 2 is an exceptionally surprising title sold at incredibly low cost. It's one of the better stealth and deception based games with shooter elements to come out of the past few years. Cops vs robbers just works so well as a theme, you will feel right at home.",Recommended,60 people found this review helpful 11,3

This is a multiplayer round based game with no story. There are however tonnes of classes to choose from, each with unique skills for both the Cop & Robber teams. It's fairly well balanced with no serious issues. The game play itself is simple yet fun and if you think outside of the box, a few cheeky tricks can be pulled off.

Usually I joke around when I leave a review but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is amazing in all ways. If you have a friend group to play it with I recommend grabbing it immediately, I have a total of around 10 people to play it with now by convincing more and more friends to buy it and we've been playing it almost every evening ever since.

The game's simple as a robber. Blend in, act like an absolute bot - literally - and pray that some innocent bank-goer will eat a bullet for you. Use the many different classes to blow up walls, hack PCs, disrupt the defending police and cash in. You're not in it for the money and prefer to spill blood? Valid playstyle, pick one of the more offensively playable classes and troll your friends with random gas explosions, mines or just snipe them from the rooftops.

The life of a cop aint as easy. You don't get any downtime as the robbers will always keep you on your toes, but at your disposal are superior firepower, tools to keep the robbers out of certain areas as well as things to help you track them down more effectively. Heard somebody around the corner opening a door? Use the detective's footprint recognition to find the rat. Is there a big group of NPCs and you're not sure what to do? Smoke em out with tear gas as Riot. Want your friends to hate your guts more than at the end of a mario party session? Play spy and blend in like the robbers would do, they will be too paranoid to make a move.

Don't like playing the ""proper"" way? There is no wrong way. Use the Firefighter's ladders supposed to be used to get high ground to instead block off hallways to annoy the living **** out of every robber trying to get past. Blow up the cops by utilizing an explosive RC car, because lets be real that's a thousand times funnier than blowing the vaults open. Or jump on top of Hornet's CCTV drone to fly around the map like a god. Infinite possibilities, infinite fun to have, infinite memories to make.",Recommended,48,0

Don't let this games graphics and advertising fool you into thinking its a budget payday or generic throw away game. It's very basically if Payday and Hitman had a baby that follows the rules of Cops and Robbers. It has honestly way too many classes with their own playstyle that are pretty well balanced with most being memes and none that are overpowered. As for bugs I haven't seen many but there are a few very annoying ones. There was one whenever I tried to join a game it would just send me back to the mainmenu. I started my own lobby though and people joined just fine. Next day it was fixed.

Rules:

Cops: The cops very basically need to figure out who the robbers are and kill them but this is easier said then done since the maps are full of smart NPC's that the Robbers need to blend in with. Cops win when all robbers are dead or time runs out.

Robbers: As the name implies Robbers are trying to rob from whatever the map is set to. But this isn't a simple smash and grab job as the cops have much better weapons and multiple lives. So this mainly forces the robbers to blend in with the NPC's by stealing cloths that match which area they are in without getting caught. From there they either need to try and break into the vaults which usually have motion sensers, camera's, and fortified vault doors. Or steal alot of small things in the open. Either way though there's almost no sneaking out since once you pick up any money you are walking around with a suspicious bag that gives you away. Thats when you will probably have to shoot your way out and get to the getaway vehicles or hide it somewhere and wait for the right moment. Robbers win by either stealing a set amount of money or burning through all the cops's lives.

NPC's: Like the name suggests these are non playable characters that exist just to be a smokescreen for the robbers but if you think you can tell the difference between a NPC and a player who's pretending to be one you are dead wrong. Unless a player is carrying a money bag, pulls out a gun, Jumps/Crouch, or is wearing the wrong outfit in the wrong area you just cant tell. Its honestly really well programmed.",Recommended,37 people found this review helpful 2,2

Fun game. Robbers play like PayDay 2 and cops play like Amongus. The team/objective elements are kind of like CSGO and the class based system is kind of like TF2.

The game is easy to learn and rounds are quick and the gameplay generally has a good pace. The community is small but friendly.

I bought the 2 pack for ~$12 and have gotten good gameplay hours out of PH2 (PH1 has no online players so I haven't really tried it much). I would recommend the game at this price point.

its a great game really it is... but it can get pretty sweaty, and people are pretty dang toxic, its also not super popular so there is a chance u dont find a server that has a lot of people. one more thing is that there are a few bugs and stuff that they havent fixed, the one that i have the most trouble with is with sheriff, anyway moving on, i would highly recomend, but to help ur experiance i would do a few thing before going into public lobbies: 1. check out each map first and find every where u can steal money from and see how npcs move. 2. practice against bots, i know it seems stupid but the hard bots are actually hard and that way u can actually test out the weapons, and abilities that each class gets. i know this is long but this is my advice on having the best experience in this game. have fun",Recommended,20,0

Played with total of 2 to 3 players. It's fun even with so few people.

Only fallback being that with not many people you will quickly learn how bots act and notice your gamesense skyrocket which might impact the fun, but then it's very easy to resort to gunfights which put a whole new twist to the game.

Initially I wasn't sure if it would deliver but boy it did, it has plenty of classes to choose from on both sides and will definitely guarantee at least two action filled evenings with your best mates.

If i had to choose a weakness, that would be the workshop content as i honestly expected it to be more vivid and ""creative"" as in breaking boundaries. Also the game seems to be enforcing a specific level editor and same area around the main level.",Recommended,13 people found this review helpful 0,2

A very fun heist game tbh. Some ppl say its scuffed and bad. but its really fun! there is a ton of maps from the workshop too. Unlike Fortnite you can make a map without a code or anything witch is nice. The limits are almost endless! Like you can make parkour in heist game if you want to! Thats is insane. Over all this game is really good. Even without the editor, but still that is a big part! My dad even is helping me build a map. He does not even like this game that much. So, there no one should have a reason to dislike it. Still if you do
not have skills to build, you can just choose a map from the workshop from this great fans! Even if you do not like these type of games you should still try it and give the game a chance. Also, yes, I wrote this whole to give 1 answer and just to write for fun. Last thing though. I want some walls in the editor that are not part inside wall and 1 part brick wall. Its really annoying when I'm building. Also I want just brick to vise-versa. So that is my thought. Thx for reading!",Recommended,24,2

We just played this on our 30+ LAN party, we had a lot (!!) of fun, despite only understanding a small part of the game.

We tried 2 maps, one seemed to be advantaged towards the cops, and the other towards the robbers. A lot of different classes and perks add quite some variability to the game and to the gameplay that need to be approached. This creates a relatively high replay factor.

I think I speak for all of our group when I say that this exceeded our expectations significantly. Definitely a go-to game for future LAN parties.

It's worth the 10 euros for me, so if you find it on sale it's definitely worth it.

The biggest downside is perhaps the amount of players online on public servers, but again, a strong recommend for LAN parties.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 2,0

Beta tester. This game is incredibly fun with friends. I was hooked after my first session. It was hard to breathe I was laughing so hard from the funny situations that naturally happen while playing. There's also a nice amount of depth in the strategies and coordination you can do with your team. You can enjoy this game with a small amount of players by adding a few bots.

The devs are really great about looking at bug reports and ideas on their discord server. Some ideas I submitted ended up in the game and bug reports got fixed quickly.",Recommended,12,0
1538,68,Perfect Heist 2,"Posted: June 20, 2023
Game is very fun and has a lot of classes that enable a lot of different complex strategies.
It gives you the freedom to win via skill and experience in ego shooters by having good aim and fighting
but also a lot of options to win sneaky without entering combat at all, it can basically range from being played like a rainbow six siege type of game to something more like a hitman type of game.
The only deficit this game currently has is that it is A LOT of fun when you play in a custom lobby with your friends but there are only very few open official servers which are often empty, or infiltrated by cheaters which sometimes makes it so you can´t play at all if your friends aren´t online.

Only advises for improvement would be to add more servers and to improve anti cheat, since it really isnt fun if a guy on a server rushes the map on horse and kills all the robbers within like 20 seconds without any intel, then gets vote kicked but simply returns some time later.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 2,2

A cool little passionate game, which the Devs actually care about.

Perfect Heist 2 is a better version of Guess Who. Seek out the player among the NPC's as Cop or try to fit in as a Robber and steal the Money from the map your currently in. Hack ATM's or Arcades or blow up a Vault and try to shoot your way through, play how you want to play. Here and there are small changes and updates which show the devs care about the Game, even though it's low price. It might be difficult and overwhelming at first, but as you play more, you will understand the gamemechanics as there are alot of different classes to chose from with a different loadout. There to help you is the ingame Tutorial and for the creative, there is a Map-Editor which is supporting the Steam Workshop.
What is missing is actual Feedback about hits. While there are bloodeffects on hit, you never know if you truly hit an opponents Head or not and the Hitboxes feel really janky at times.
If you play a match with Bots, they wont count as real players. If you die on the robbers team while a bot is still alive, the game will end. Cop AI has a simular problem. Ability's that show player positions etc. will not show the AI.

Conclusion: It's better than Battefield 2042 in price and gameplay. Get it with a group of friends (about 4 players needed) and have fun.",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,0

There are some downsides though, the main one being that the menu's are incredibly buggy, everytime we swap maps I have to relaunch the entire game, I also do not like that as soon as I create a lobby a countdown timer starts which is kind of annoying when I am trying to send invites out to 8 other people and try and get them in before the initial timer counts down.

Entertaining Coop-PvP-Game about subterfuge and chaos.

I exclusivly play Joker Class to represent the effects society has on a once funtioning member of the so called and aforementioned society we live in.
It perfectly reflects how the mind of an alleged ""free thinker"" gets corrupted by the inevitbale evil he/she has to face in his/her everyday life.
Humans are not made to be cogs in a machine spinning endlessly until the end of their prime, their minds are designed to be free and expressive, not to be surpressed and dictated around.
This game gives me the freedom to practice a heist before I put it into action irl.
Thanks for this great heist simulation so far I managed to rob about 2 banks and already made plans to rob a third.

4.5/5 Stars because I couldn't get top 3 on Joker but I peaked global rank 4

100% Perfect Heist 2 Review

This game is pretty fun to play, once you understand how it works it gets a lot better. It is overwhelming at first, but you get used to it. Grinding out all the achievement's is also very easy, just join a quick join lobby, and if it has just you alone or even 1 other person, you can usually grind out some of the harder ones easily. This is a fun game to play for the social deduction style of games, and can see it being a lot of fun with lots of friends and family.",Recommended,4 people found this review helpful 0,2

This game is very very good. It gets a reasonable amount of updates and patches every so often, so it balances itself when new content gets released.
For what it provides a $10 pricetag is certainly worth it. A game this affordable means you can get quite a few friends in on the grift.
I've also screwed with the level editor. It exists. It's fine, but it takes time to get used to.

This game has an awesome concept, and unlike the first installation, it has a much better execution. It improves on all the mediocrities of the first game and created it to be a much better game. The game's 32 classes all are pretty fun to play solo, and you could totally create team comps with this. I'm happy to say I enjoy this game, even with my small amount of time played, and it will be fun to see the future of this game. 10/10 should buy.",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

Really the only downside to this game is low player counts, it's hit or miss if you can get into a public game. However, once you can get into one or if you have a group of friends to play with it is a great game. New classes added often, constant bug fixes, rebalencing, and class changes. Would definitely recommend",Recommended,2 people found this review helpful 0,0

Yes, I don't care if graphics aren't great, thats not what makes a great game. What is this game?

So... payday except where one team of players plays as the cops. So... cops and robbers except there's a bunch of AI neutral citizens that the robbers have to try to mimic their movement styles to ""Hide in plain sight"". So hide and seek payday, except with something like 50 classes to choose through (some for crooks, some for cops).

So, depending on how you work together and pick your classes, determines how well your strategy works against the other teams strategy, that you don't know about beforehand. And if you don't work together, you get this mix of who even knows whats happening against who even knows what they're using. Get enough money before the cops stop you. Don't shoot a civ if you're a cop. Robbers only have one life each. There's usually a pool of lives for cops, but don't waste them all. :D D: Woowoo!",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 1,0

Let me start by saying I was very skeptical about this game initially. The concept essentially being cops and robbers didn’t seem like a very compelling basis for a game for me. I was completely and utterly wrong. This game has taken over my friend group’s lives. When we get 5+ people together one of the first things we think about playing is Heist and it only gets better as those numbers go up. Honestly I think this is one of the best multiplayer games I’ve played in some years as its replayability is through the roof.

My only gripe is that playing online with randoms isn’t that fun, but I think that’s simply because there’s no banter like there is between friends. Ultimately I would recommend this game for any gaming group of 5+ if you like the theme, the concept, or just the idea of tricking and killing your friends while pulling off a bank heist.

In conclusion, good game good.",Recommended,4 people found this review helpful 0,2

Its got some bugs but its pretty fun. I wish the sniper on the robber side didn't fire rounds that moved as a snail's pace but for $10 that I didn't spend its pretty good

update: the sniper is good now. The NPCs now have more varied movement patterns and will look at you weird so the game isn't as much of a 'pretend you're an NPC or get got' simulator. Its actually shaping up to be a pretty fun game to play with 4-10 other people in a discord call.",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,0

classes:
the game has a huge amount of classes for both police and robbers which make every round different and changes your tactics and your enemy's tactics
police:
playing as the police is usually a waiting game but when you hear an alarm a glass break or a door open it's always exciting to go check what happened and try to find who the robber is
robbers:
playing as a robber is usually about blending with the npcs until you attack, it's usually at its best when you take risks and fight the cops
combat:
the gunplay in the game isn't very satisfying or fluent but it gets the job done and the classes abilities build on top of it and make it interesting and fun
map maker:
the map maker is one of the best map makers i've seen, it lets you work fast but also get into detail, and you can make almost everything you see in the official maps",Recommended,7 people found this review helpful 1,0

The tasks are more fun, the map is nicer, the cosmetics are wonderful, built-in roles and modes add far more depth to the game and do not require mods, built-in proximity chat for private games. The game is adorable, the humor is fantastic, and really I could just keep going on and on with positives about this game.

Unlike Among Us, I actually don't mind playing this game solo because the lobbies seem full of interesting and polite people, the games are fun, and the collection of coins to buy more cosmetics (plus the collection of components to build things) gives me incentive to keep playing. Best of all, this game is free. I did buy a coin bundle to support to devs - that is how much I adore this game. Play it! You wont be disappointed.",Recommended,169,0

This game is a lot of fun. But the Devs are not nice people. A streamer was being harassed in his channel because he said ""I find the game boring"" but they also said ""I play the game and support it for my viewers"". And the person who was harassing the streamer is a Moderator for the game and the lead game teaster! After contacting them about the issue the streamers account was banned. They also reach out on social media platforms and was blocked. I also messaged one of the devs and he blocked me on discord. I have the screenshot for proof.

The only Amogus ""rip-off"" that is actually good if not better than Amogus itself. It looks better, plays better and has more features which adds more variety to the gameplay than just ""either the impostors wins or the crewmates"". Goose Goose Duck has many roles that you can choose to have in your game or not. It gives the players a different approach instead of just doing the tasks and win. The game also has VC and Proximity VC.

There are many more things I can note that makes this game more fullfilling and fun but to put it all in short. This is basically the Unofficial Among Us 2

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",Recommended,237,0

Just downloaded the game a few hours ago to try out some new games in my spare time and came across this gem. Prox. chat enabled lobbies along with text chat only lobbies balance out and give the player a more comfortable experience. The ability to level up your character creating interesting styles and unique traits for your goose is great. The ability to leave a game, where you may not connect with the other players and find a new lobby immediately is a good option. Players have for the most part been friendly, so if you wanted to play a game to find new friends, I would 100% give this one a shot.

Basically ""Among Us"" but bird themed with roles and built in proximity chat. The devs really put in lots of work and make updates often, either introducing new roles or just some slight tweaks. I definitely recommend. This game deserves 100x more popularity than it currently has. With a good group of friends it can be either hilarious or tense in a good way. Either way its fun.",Recommended,50,0

UPDATE: Gaggle staff has been a big help to fix an issue that has been plaguing me specifically which made me unable to play the game. Even going as far as requesting outside help to get it done. While i still have a hard disagree with their core development philosophies, I can respect that I've been wrong on how they treat others, because it isn't only bad interactions, it is good interactions too.
___________

I've played this game a lot, and looking at this game from just a gameplay perspective, I love it for what it is. For a Among Us clone, this plays well, is quite polished and gets regular updates.

HOWEVER, the reason I cannot recommend this game are the developers. Quite frankly, they lucked their way to the current state of the game and depend on the playerbase buying into their gimmick incentives for gameplay. They then ban you on their public forums for pointing this out to them, because they have an apparently huge ego.

If you want an example, the Mechanic Goose role is a role that can use the vents of the maps, so an Engineer from Among Us mods. This role is, for some reason, immortal while venting and encourages the player to just sit in vents all game long, effectively making the vents for the Impostors completely useless as they will get caught. It also denies the Pigeon role their win condition, because the Pigeon needs to infect each player during one round to win, which they cannot due to a Mechanic Goose just sitting in vents all game. It also makes it frustrating for Geese to win because they need to complete tasks to win, but many Mechanics just don't do this. It is a terribly implemented role, and when I brought this up for the second time, I was told I have ""a lot of strong opinions"", which is an arrogant answer to the concern of a player.

Not to mention, they have roles whose sole purpose is to give you 2 or 3 more coins for completing an objective, and coins are used to purchase cosmetics. The issue is that most cosmetics need 1k+ coins to unlock and in worst case scenarios, these coin roles have an incentive to completely throw games just for these few coins, while just being worse roles than roles without an ability. A few Impostor roles are also just worse than a regular Impostor.

Their inability to receive feedback that isn't praise is clear as day to me, and because of this I cannot recommend it, despite playing the game. And that's because there simply isn't an alternative to this game.",Not Recommended,513,78

Goose Goose Duck is the game to go to if you liked Among Us but wanted more. While Among Us had one gamemode, three maps, and spent all it's time on one big map, Goose Goose Duck has several maps with several different tasks, five different gamemodes, a good multitude of roles, including neutral positions and many different ways to play the game that exercise different skill sets. Not only that, it is constantly updating, so new gamemodes, maps, and roles are coming.",Recommended,40 people found this review helpful 4,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've been playing this game more hours than Steam lets on. The obvious comparison to Goose Goose Duck is Among Us, but where Among Us felt old after a few rounds, I can't stop playing Goose Goose Duck. So many options for geese(good guys) and ducks(killers) has each round exciting for everybody in the match. Instead of starting each round hoping to only be killing people, any of the roles feels useful and exciting. No longer can you just look for suspicious people to vote out. Now you're wondering ""Was that guy in the vent on my team? Did I just watch a Vigilante(good guy role) use his only kill to kill another killer? Was that even a vigilante at all or just a killer pretending?"" As soon as you think you have the round and the characters figured out, a whole new way of using them pops up and surprises everyone.

TLDR; The game is free and amazing. Literally no reason not to download",Recommended,46,0

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",Recommended,457,0

Essentially a derpy Among Us with roles. If you have ever played modded Among Us, and love geese killing each other, then this game is for you. There is nothing better to wake you up in the morning than a decapitated goose.
I do have 2 negatives to this game however
1. There seem to be a lot of roles in this game that are relatively pointless the majority of the time and can feel like a letdown when you get them.
2. The player base seems to be pretty heavy with very young children screaming nonsense into their mics. A little annoying to say the least.

☐ Amazing!

Just downloaded the game a few hours ago to try out some new games in my spare time and came across this gem. Prox. chat enabled lobbies along with text chat only lobbies balance out and give the player a more comfortable experience. The ability to level up your character creating interesting styles and unique traits for your goose is great. The ability to leave a game, where you may not connect with the other players and find a new lobby immediately is a good option. Players have for the most part been friendly, so if you wanted to play a game to find new friends, I would 100% give this one a shot.

Hope this helped! :)",Recommended,107,0

If you think it's a knock off Among-Us, no that's wrong. This is what among us WISHES it could be. It's got all the modes you normally have to mod in, the prox chat you wish they would add by default, seasonal events and sooo much more.

Pros:
Better animations
Cleaner artstyle
WAY more unique tasks
Servers aren't getting hacked
Dead Memes aren't made of geese

Cons:
Prices in the shop are a bit steep. Plan to spend at least 10+ hours for some of those items
People WILL DC if they can not maintain a stable internet connection. There is no rejoin button.

Short version: Raw fun. Better with friends.

Too elaborate a little:
- IMHO it's better than Among Us. And also free.
- More bells and wistles aka roles.
- Ingame voice chat with proximity option. No more Discord shenanigans!
- For me and my group this game is more stable and less gimicky on server part than analogs.
- Gorgeous maps with unique ideas and roles.
- Devs have there own discord channel where they welcome new ideas for almost anything. Indicating that they are actively working on expanding on what there is already.

The game is pretty much like among us, but wierder I guess. There are plenty more roles then among us, making it rather fresh and frankly more fun to play in my experience. However, just like among us, there are only annoying children playing in the public rooms, so if you are going to play it has to be private with friends. At least it's free so if people aren't against playing it's easy to form a squad, and honestly, these kind of games are funner with friends regardless of if the public matches are absolute hell unearthed.",Recommended,34,0

Overall this game is pretty much similar to Among Us, but free. It's fun and enjoyable playing with randoms, but would probably be more fun with friends.

Other than that, anyone should give it a chance.",Recommended,31,0

People sleeping on this game fr fr

Imagine among us, but all the mods (ie. Proximity Chat, Roles) are already built into the game. There are a ton of unlockables, multiple game modes, environment kills and more.

No more waiting for your technically challenged friend to fix their mic on proxychat
No more usain bolting to the bathroom so you don't get booted in the lobby
No more playing just imposter vs crewmates like some sort of normie dormie
No more playing pretend just to play ""tag mode"" in among us (let's be honest, we all tried that but it was silly af)

Can you still have fun in among us? Yes, there's probably a lot more you can do with custom mods in Among Us. But I, for one, rather order off the menu than build my own burger yknow?

Among us walked so Goose Goose Duck can run. I would definitely give this game a try.

Long story short, this game bussin bussin",Recommended,60,1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It is like among us but you have different gamemodes you can play other than just crewmate vs imposter. If you play the classic, each player can have a different role (such as a dodo where you are not the imposter but if you can act sus enough and get voted out before the actual imposter then you win) there are tons of roles and it is soooo much more fun. Ducks are the killers/imposter and the geese are the ""crewmates"". Online with randoms can be pretty toxic but if you hve some friends and do private lobbies it is a great game. I will choose this game over among us any time.",Recommended,32,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is seriously so fun and the devs are top tier. They literally bent over backwards to help me with an issue where I wasn't able to jump in. They're constantly adding stuff and making changes and I've happily spent almost 50 hours playing and can see myself playing for a long ass time in the future. I highly recommend giving it a go.",Recommended,45,0

if you have friends to play with you'll probably have a good time...

but if youre expecting to play in public lobbies you can expect:
being interrogated on if you have a mic, being interrogated on your age, being yelled at for sounding young, being yelled at for being a woman, power tripping lobby owners that wait 10-15 minutes to start games because theyre busy interrogating everyone in the lobby, power tripping lobby owners that will kick you for being a woman, power tripping lobby owners that will kick you for speaking before them in meetings, power tripping lobby owners that will organize a manhunt on specific players every game because of something they said 5 games ago, sexist players who openly scream about how much they hate woman and want to harm them, and much much more!

honestly, the gameplay is pretty fun, alot more fun than among us or town of salem, but the community is just terrible and not worth the need to create a second account. its a free to play game, and free to play games have a tendency to attract some pretty undesirable players and unfortunately those undesirable players are the majority of the community, and unless something is done about it this game is not worth your time",Not Recommended,83,0

Connectivity and audio issues aside, I hosted a public room which led to some players being voted out (including me) for not speaking Chinese. Some of them were also swearing and being rude in Chinese, knowing the rest of us couldn't understand. I know this because a friend of mine watching the session speaks the language.

It would be nice if there was an in-game feature to remind/restrict language use to the host's or something, but judging by the dev's response to my feedback, it seems that they think I care about my content (by indirectly saying I should manage my lobby better) rather than improving the game experience for everyone (especially because there are kids playing too).

I thought this would be a fun game for all ages, but considering how many times I've heard people being toxic in the public rooms, I wouldn't recommend this game for children or the soft-hearted.",Not Recommended,181,0

Executed them as Sheriff right after the game has started.
He was a killer.
Got yelled at in lobby again.

Really enjoyed this game for quite a while. Was fun earning new costume pieces via the game play. Then, they ""renovated"" the claw machines, and now everything above a certain rarity costs actual money, just for a random roll. Want something specific from the top-rarity items? It's cost you a lot. How much? That all depends on your luck, but as a point of reference, if you want EVERYTHING from the top-tier claw machine, it will cost you upwards of $1475.00. And that's just based on my doing the most cost-effective math available.

Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ you guys. I used to play daily, just to earn claw machine coins. That was fun. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, fake ""micro-transaction"" math you don't think anyone does? I did it. Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ you.",Not Recommended,34 people found this review helpful 3,0

Well Its easy to learn I would say, but maybe not for everyone, since I watched a lot of my favorite people play this game, but when you learn more about the game and the functions and roles, its easier,

and yes many servers may have people who are very touchy on age like 18+
'kick this person because their a kid' or 'kick this person their voice is annoying'
(some here do have high voices)
even if those servers didn't say anything about an age restriction and everyone is warned before joining a game, if they read the warning they know the consequence for joining but still,
The game can get boring sometimes when someone isn't doing their task or they keep calling meetings, so the game wont end,
And Sometimes when you die, the game lasts forever but their is no tasks for you to at least do that can get annoying, truly
While people use mics and people use chat, a lot of Mic users don't read the chat for the ones who don't use mics (Maybe they echo), children who want to have fun but the server is picky with age, or they just like using chat.
that can get frustrating. even if your in a situation and your getting blamed but they wont read chat and that is what you just use.

but besides that we have a daily reward type structure, events happen so we can possibly get new items or even clothes. we can customize ourselves and our backdrop, friend people, and get some pretty interesting things for badges like Dapper, one of my favorite badges.
I haven't played for long but I've learned a lot already, without even including I watched people play, when I started playing again since my first time I joined (I just joined a lobby for 5 minutes then I had to leave)
I played for a little about a few weeks ago, Bloodhaven wasn't out yet and when i came back recently,
!New Map!
I went over played a round and learned the new roles very quickly, and the people I watched who plays goose goose duck, didn't make anything about it yet, one of them didn't even know about the Esper or the Stalker, they haven't been in for a while then, but i was glad I learned it quickly, the roles aren't always easy,

But this can get fun even if you have a good group of people to play with, I recommend this,

Like most who play Goose Goose Duck, I began by playing Among Us! It was not long into playing I met others and began playing with VoiceChat, then began playing the modded versions of Among Us - before I knew it - regular/no voice Among Us suddenly seemed stale and lifeless.

And then I heard about something called 'Proxy Chat', which means you can talk to other players while you are on the ship, but only if you are within eyesight of someone/within their proximity. There is a program you download separate from Among Us that allowed you to use this feature... but unfortunately it was very buggy, unstable, and would never work, resulting in many people just repeating ""can you hear me?"" or ""I cannot hear anyone.""

THEN GOOSE GOOSE DUCK GAME ALONG! Goose Goose Duck takes the gameplay of Among Us, mixed with the modded versions of Among Us and offers Proxy Chat IN the game, itself! This game offers the best of all worlds that have been inspired by Among Us!

You can play with 16 people in a game. It features many roles like; Sheriff, Vigilante, Assassin, Mechanic, and one of my personal favourites, Canadian. It has the built in and very stable Proxy Chat and automatically mutes ghosts who are then only about to hear each other. You earn in game money and crafting materials by doing tasks which you can use to purchase or craft new outfits, pets, and other silly things. It has other random options that Among Us doesn't like; the option to start every player in a random part of the map instead of bunched together around the emergency button, different game modes like 'Goose Hunt' that is basically Hide&Seek, lobbies with zero time limits so you no longer need to worry about your room cancelling out while waiting for someone to join, the ability to fart, and more!

Now that I have learned Goose Duck, I am not sure I can ever go back to Among Us! Oh, and Goose Goose Duck is FREE!",Recommended,27,0

Personally I don't have a lot of hours in this game compared to others but this is still probably my most played game on steam. I have been playing since Black Swan was new and I have tried to follow the game ever since with some of my friends and overall, it's a great game that you should at least try. And yes, it is basically among us, but the game offers a lot of variety to it in the form of roles which have gotten pretty crazy over every update. This makes the game very repayable for people who came from among us and offers a lot of unique gameplay. The biggest problem with this is that for new players it CAN be confusing and it is definitely recommended to look at the tutorial before you start so that you aren't bumbling your way through matches. The game is also filled to the brim with achievements so if you are achievement hunting... good luck xd. And overall the game is enjoyable and was able to keep my few braincells entertained for over 300 hours with no expense, so at least try it if you like social deduction games. The only thing I'd recommend is to NOT TAKE THE GAME SERIOUSLY since this is a very goofy game that is filled with children. I couldn't count how many 18+ lobbies I have seen so that they could avoid people who don't take the game seriously and it can really dampen your opinion to watch yourself get voted for absolutely no reason so just play with friends that you trust or just let go and have some mindless fun.",Recommended,16,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Goose Goose Duck, a free alternative to Among Us, and a pretty impressive one at that.

Before I downloaded this game and first gave it a go, I was under the impression that it was basically just Among Us at its core, and to be perfectly honest, it looks like it on the surface, but oh, just you wait until we get to the tasks.

There's a lot more tasks to go through, some more original than others, and that's a good thing.
Player count maxes at 16, which is a step up compared to Among Us' new 15 player limit.

The more you play, the more you get coins for other cosmetics, so you don't have to pay a few dollars, which is good.
Only downside is that you'd either need a Google or a Gaggle account to actually play the game, but this doesn't really bother me too badly - playing just from a Steam account alone has its advantages and disadvantages.

Aside from the one complaint, Goose Goose Duck is a fun Among Us-styled game that I would personally recommend, especially when you can't be arsed to shell out five bucks.

1883,203,Goose Goose Duck,"Posted: June 20
I have over 1500 hours played in this game and have played it since mid 2021, and I have to say I'm beyond disappointed in what Goose Goose Duck has become. I was already really annoyed at the high cost of purchasing most items in this game, during such a difficult economic time and didn't think it could possibly get worse, but here we are. I don't think I've ever seen a game with the in-game/app purchases being so bad.

I had about 40k silver saved up to buy things in the store, and over 60 gold to save up for either a pet or a pair of eyes. This took MONTHS of game play to save up. In this new system, with my 40k silver, I got almost all junk items I'd never spend those silver coins on, in a gamble because the machine prize pools are massive. With my gold I only had two shots on the 30G machine, one gave me an outfit I would never in a million years buy for myself as I'm not very comfortable with it, and the other I got a hat item that's been there since the beginning and deliberately never bought. I also got a lot of duplicate items that gave very little dust, and my dust rewards from all that silver reached a bit over 1k, which will buy me hardly anything in the new store that consists of old shop items. I don't even want to imagine how long you'd have to play in order to get anything decent, but that's probably the point, to encourage you to buy more. You could spend a fortune gambling in this game and still never get what you're after with the new machine setup. This game is not at all what it used to be at the beginning and it looks like it won't be again. What a shame.

Sure, the gameplay might still be free, that's great for those who want to get together every now and then to play. But that'll only please people temporarily. Long-term players that have supported this game for years, like having goals, and in this game those goals are cosmetics, which has been taken away unless you're willing to spend a fortune on gambling. I'll never understand decisions like these to change what isn't broken and ignoring things that are for the sake of money. Instead of encouraging more people to buy from you by making more reasonably available to more people to buy, you drive away those that normally would buy what you're offering and completely scare away everyone else.",Not Recommended,16 people found this review helpful 1,0

even tho the game is fun and you can have loads of fun, the game is somewhat Pay 2 Win as there are a few emotes that you need to buy with real money to win (like turning into a ball and gaining super speed for a few seconds, or even a punch emote that can let you punch people out of the game) and not everybody has access to them.
Later Edit: Found another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ emote that can ruin the game. the HUG emote lets players pick up other players and move them (in water or out of the map)

To be honest, it's a lot of fun and good for a free game ( Similar To ' Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout ' )

But for some reason this game is considered "" PAY2WIN ""

People who buy Battle Pass In-Game can punch, kick, and throw at others by taking an special emote !
Well, of course, for a game in this style, throwing the rest is an easy way to become a champion and win
In Persian, we have a proverb that says: "" گاو نه من شیر ده "" , In English, it means a cow that gives you a lot of milk, but in the end, when you want to take the milk out of it, the cow kicks into the milk container and somehow takes back all the favors it has done to you.

March 2022 Edit:
I was aware of the certain pay to win elements the game had in the past, but it was never that bad for me until recently where every single lobby i join have at least one with a pay to win advantage..
to those who don't know, there are 2 paid emotes in the game that you can use to kick or punch other players which provides a huge advantage
you can easily abuse the punch in stages where you have to stand still or avoid some hazards like lasers, and you can abuse the kick emote to push yourself forward after double jumping
i used to face people with these like once every 15 matches or so, which was fine
but now that they're in every single lobby i can no longer recommend the game unfortunately.

------------------------

A fun Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout clone, but still needs some work
I'm gonna go ahead and list some of the stuff that i personally think needs improving:
- The music lacks variety and gets repetitive real fast (i was sick of it less than an hour in)
- Map selection screen is buggy, sometimes it goes too fast, sometimes it goes too slow, sometimes it ends in 3 seconds and other times it takes a lot longer
- There is no escape menu once you're in a server, so there is no way for you to check settings or leave game
- Some bugs here and there
- Needs more content to keep people interested
Overall its not too bad for a mobile game, and it should be worth a try once it goes F2P like the devs said in a previous announcement.",Recommended,94,0

As this game has been taken by current development team. It has become pay to win game. It lost it simplicity and fun. main goal is to make you pay for characters, VIP pass, gems, special moves.
It raises serious behavioral issues with adolescent kids. It has spinning to win process with payment. That makes adolescent addiction to gambling and buying.
The prices for gems and characters are enormous up to 20-30€.
The developers do not have any ethics or moral and are they exploit children for profit.

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",Recommended,207,0

Stumble Guys feels like a child of Roblox and Fall Guys, with difficulty mode toned down to easy. And even if people call it a cheap rip-off, it somehow works and is fun to play.

+ Some levels are even better than these in Fall Guys. Hot Wheels level was so fun to play, and so the watersliding one. I wasn't expected to have that much fun playing these
+ Watching other people failures is more amusing than in Fall Guys

- It's pay to win. In the recent event, the premium pass last reward is an action skill that can be used to knock over other players. Because of that special action, I lost a few times to players who paid for the premium pass. I found out that in the past there were some other skills, like punching other players. That disqualifies the game for me.

But you wouldn't know that from other reviews as everybody is focused on calling the game names or trying to makes the most ""funny"" reviews ever. Yeah champ, good job on your unique meme with le funny picture.

Anyway, the p2w thing is the reason for the negative review. Fall Guys devs at least don't put that kind of in-game stuff that lets you win easier.",Not Recommended,118,0

Horrible to even get into unless you want to fork out cash to win. If that is your style, this game is perfect for you. Emotes that physically harm and alter the game are hid behind a (pay wall) battle pass. It does give you the option to earn enough gems to get the battle pass by spending the gems you have. However, Any attempt at doing so results in running into players who have played much longer and/or paid to win who simply use said emotes against you for an early out. You earn no gems and you are lucky if you get some of what it cost you back. You are simply a punching bag if you are a new player.

I love goofy time killer games that allow you to relax a bit. Fall guys had the ability to grab and pull which lead to toxic players. This is worse. Just as toxic. Half the player base is able to mess with you and you just have to take it or pay up.",Not Recommended,77,0
1983,93,Stumble Guys,"Posted: July 17
I genuinely enjoyed the game at the start because it was more chill and the games were quick-paced. I moved from fall guys to this game as I rather play a game that doesn't require sabotage to win and actually let you make it to the end normally.

Until they added the freaking emotes to this game that was initially hidden behind a paywall, like the punch emote that was from the battle-pass. I rejoined after a long while, and I get hit with the stupid hug emote. When you get to the final two players in a tournament, people would just spam the hug emote on you and suicide, rewarding them an instant win. Half the game you're forced to dodge people emoting instead of playing the game.

Game would literally be better off without any emotes, but the devs will probably not remove it because they're getting money from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players that can only pay to win.",Not Recommended,38,0

Dollar Store Fall Guys but actually decent quality and not ruined by Epic gutting the dev team and actively making the game worse. Seems to be a mobile first title, at the very least in UI elements of the main menu. Didn't even see a quit button and had to Alt-F4. Physics are acceptable, game variety pretty good. All these cross over deals and I even saw merch while walking around in Walmart before but it seems not a ton of that revenue goes back into the game in terms of polishing things up. Music loop isn't clean(I can personally hear a pretty clear stop and start as it loops), not a ton of variety in the tunes, the skybox is straight out of ToonTown Online without upping the resolution. To compare this to peak Fall Guys, it's like FG was polished up with a fine polishing compound and Stumble Guys got a pass with 400 Grit sand paper and sent out the door. I would like to see some more fun physics interactions and more than just jump and dive. Maybe bring it up to 64 person matches. Recommended because its still decent.",Recommended,32,0

Edit: Most of it still stand, the battle pass still cost money to give you ability you don't have for free

this game lure you into a false sense of security. It first start you with bot so you think you are hot ♥♥♥♥, then slowly matches you with more player, and then no more matchmaking, so you get some tryhard who know all the line since the stuff isn't random, just like in the beginning of fall guy.

then there's the play/pay to get ability. In fall guy, everyone can grab, in this game you have to reach a certain level in the battle pass to unlock the emote that allow you to grab, and level up more for the emote to punch.

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lies and deceipt.

""I am a 50 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.
I am a single father for my son who is now 14 years old. My son has recently started playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
In less than a week, he has already played more than 20 hours.
It was terrible for me, because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son.
because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.
So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so I was pretty lost. I asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game.
I liked it as it was the best time I have had with my son since my wife died. Playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything and it brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside of the house.""",Recommended,64,0

Vote in my opinion :

Positive things :
+ Good skins
+ Good Gameplay ( same as fallguys)
+ f2p can get rare skins easily, no need to pay to have nice stuff
+ Fun

Negative things :
+ too many bots >:(
+ a bunch of bots
( a 32 player game has about 12 bots , but it's ok I will still support and play this game )

Stumble Guys is basically a small and free version of Fall Guys in which the levels are shorter and the trails shorter,
many levels are also based on the levels you can play in fall guys but are more compact and made for 32 players.
There are a total of 17 different levels, which is already quite a lot and makes for great follow-up levels.
Definitely recommended and fun to do with a group of friends.

When Stumble Guys first came out, it was a relatively good game for entertainment, but now it’s full of problems.
The in-game abilities are paid and have to be purchased from the shop.
The game is filled with bots, so there’s no real competition to win with the presence of bots.
Although there are many maps, it often keeps repeating just a few, which makes it quite repetitive.
The game also frequently freezes during the map selection loading screen. Overall, it’s not bad for a short time of entertainment.

Honestly, the game play is pretty fun if you like casual game modes and just messing around. The real downside to this game is that you can get duplicates on your ""rolls"" or whatever, even if you choose to spend real money. Given the vast amount of skins in this game, that mechanic is single handedly responsible for this negative review. I cannot in good conscience recommend a game where if you choose to spend money in it, your money is less than useless in relation to a virtual item.",Not Recommended,12 people found this review helpful 0,0

WARNING!

Game with Pay to Win features

The season pass (included in the Steam version but not in the mobile version) has in its last place, emotes that give advantage and affect the gameplay, such as kicking or hitting other players.
So you will have advantage over mobile players who do not have the pass and all players who have not managed to complete the pass, this also forces you to complete the pass before the end of the season to get that emote, in other words, grind the season pass.

The game is extremely repetitive. When you play a game, one of two things happen.

as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. iam also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex.",Recommended,33,0

Do you enjoy games where rare (or payed for) items give others the ability to say knock you off levels at a distance? how about items that make them move faster, or fall slower, what about someone walking up to you and you can no longer control your character as they stun and just walk you off the ledge? this is that game. its very pay to win. if you dont want to spend about $25 bucks a week on this game, dont play. its got good reviews, but thats mostly because most people when they find a p2w free game that agrevates them, they just delete it, and the whales just give glowing reviews. though it seems a lot of the reviews until recently were from before they added a lot of the bad mechanics from recent updates. if you do play, I hope you have the patience of a saint.",Not Recommended,22,0

Very great and fun game, with the addition of Ranked. But I have a little issue here, many players (mostly F2P players) in the game don't have that good abilities and get eliminated by other players instantly, ruining their experience. I would suggest adding an option in Ranked which disables all abilities, just to make it fair for other players without any abilities to enjoy their experience without any problem. Also some players are able to hack in the game, adding an Anti-Cheat system will help a lot in preventing hackers from cheating",Recommended,13 people found this review helpful 1,0

epic game but gets kind of boring if you play it too much, here is some suggestions to make the game better.

Level Editor: lets you make your own levels and play them, could also choose which maps to play and which ones to keep out.

More Level features: jump pads, portals, boxes (physics), turrets, lazers, tesla coils, etc.

extreme mode: same levels, but with added hazards (got this idea when playing on the map with the 2 orbiting circles and placing a tesla coil on both of them, instead of fighting me and my brother tried to see who survived longest)

workshop levels: lets you download other peoples levels.

gamemodes: King of the hill, capture the flag, tag, etc.

more customization: such as hats, faces, textures, body-shapes, and animations (ex: top hat, frowning face, rocky texture, square shape, and rolling animation)

online match-making: everybody wants this.

select-able random skills: lets you toggle skills you want and don't want when using random (if you don't want growth/shrink ray when using random, you can toggle them off.)

more skills: duh.

customizable gameplay: lets you change stuff while playing such as gravity slider, faster/slower skill reloads, faster/slower movement speed, jump hight, etc.

add health option: everybody has lives, so when they die, they respawn but with one less life. (respawn skill just lets you save lives)

some form of single player: mabye survive waves of enemies, or try to survive in a level where every 10 seconds a new hazard spawns in.

organizable skills: skills can be categorized by movement, offensive, defensive, or misc.

levels: mabye add a campaign where you unlock skills as you go through, and have to change them before every level, defeating enemies, and parkouring your way to next level.

thats about it, hope developer sees this and considers some of the ideas.",Recommended,184,2

My son (10 yo) and I (40 yo) played together. We messed around with many different abilities. Including the time stop (""za warudo""), the beam, shrink ray, grow ray, and revive. The controls are smooth, tight, and responsive. The maps change every round. And the balance of abilities changes with the maps. Out of 20 matches, we cracked up laughing at least 10 times. Especially the last round where my son used time stop, hit me with beam, but then we both revived and only I survived because my revive was on land while his revive was on top of land that got beamed into the ocean. The amount of abilities that all feel brokenly over-powered, yet somehow balanced, is mind blowing. If you appreciate game design - you are in for many treats.",Recommended,266,3

They just don't make em like this any more.

Bopl Battle is a innovative and fantastic game in that it doesn't try to be more than it is. These days every game needs to have fifty skins for each character, strict line ups for balance, balance patches, carefully coordinated structure, preparation for potential esports, so on.. so forth.
And while many of these things aren't bad, they're often added at such priority that they bog down development or get in the way of other things.

Bopl Battle is a couch battler, ala Smash Brothers, and doesn't try to be anything else.
Unlike Smash Brothers and most other games in the genre, Bopl Battle doesn't try at all to confine you, in fact, it tries to enable you to break the game.
With modular power sets, multiple abilities, and combos and ability interactions abound all across the board in both expected and sometimes unexpected ways, Bopl Battle invites you to sit down with some friends and duke it out without caring too much about the result.

It's a pvp game that doesn't try to be competitive, it's not about the win, it's about playing the game itself and having fun with it.

A serious breath of fresh air in a genre choking on its cameo-focused fighter games and esports.",Recommended,118,0

In my earnest opinion, Bopl Battle is one of the most innovative and creativity-inducing games of this year (along with Tears Of The Kingdom and Baldurs Gate 3).

Bopl Battle is fun, enraging, hearty, and makes you think outside the box. In Bopl Battle, there are endless amounts of combos and scenarios that you can come across or think of. The pure satisfaction of hitting a clever trickshot or outplaying your opponent with some crazy combo you thought of just gives me the feeling that no other game has brought me. This game has almost no flaws. The music is awesome, the graphics are very nice and stylized, and the gameplay is pretty smooth. The only thing it lacks is player count and multiplayer, which, to be fair, is hard to do as an indie developer with not too many funds.
Overall, I would 100% recommend buying this game and hopping on with a couple of friends to have the time of your life. 10/10",Recommended,114,2
2127,27,Bopl Battle,"Posted: March 3
If you have a group of friends (or even just one) to play with, this is one of the most fun multiplayer games in decades. Not even kidding.
It's like the perfect blend of Smash Bros and Worms.

My friends and I have played a few times a week since it came out, and no signs of stopping.

If the dev reads this, please please please keep supporting the game however you can. Little bug fixes are awesome, but adding new maps or somehow a map maker or game mode editor would be insanely awesome. Maybe a way to edit which weapons are allowed before a match, etc.

The game is already so much fun, but has infinite potential. This game needs to blow up! The definition of a hidden gem.",Recommended,70,0

Fantastic Game, I hate my friends now!

But in all honesty. I find this a great Game. I found it through the developers YouTube Shorts and was istantly hooked. I tried the free demo and gifted my friends the full game for Christmas.

The mechanics are creative, the rounds are short and always funny. We often find ourselves in Situations where we say something like ""lets start the evening with Bopl Battle and see if we can play something else later"" and then and up playing this game for hours straight. It is just addictive.

I would recommend it if you like games like Smash Bros or games that destroy your friendships in general.

I've only played it with my brother, and I can only imagine the chaos is even more fun with more players! The powers are unique and fun, and they combine in some really interesting ways! It's super fun to realize that yes, you can hit the black hole with a shrink ray too many times and get a white hole, or clone yourself with double revives, or push the entire stage off the screen.

Very fun multiplayer game both in local co op and online. Choose 3 different abilities out of many to battlle others with satisfying gameplay, cute cartoony visuals and sound effects causing endless laughs and fun. It's great in short bursts or slightly extended sessions if you mix things up every so often in the match, as you can quick swap abilities between rounds. Using the random ability option also adds a different level of fun as you don't know what mixture of abilities you will get to use. Definitely recommended if you are looking for an amusing multiplayer game to play with family and/ or friends. It's very easy to learn, looks cute and entertaining, and is just fun all round.",Recommended,47,0

This is an absolutely amazing game with unique mechanics and features. It is still in its infancy, which means that there are plenty of issues, but a lot of them have already been sorted out. The game is so new the community is basically all at the same skill level which makes it so you actually have a fun time playing with people. If you do get good at this game, there are competitive servers where you can play more seriously. I'm excited to see where this game goes.

I am coming back to edit my review and say that everything about this game is stellar and mostly up to pace. The only thing that it is lacking is your inability to play the game on Apple devices, which is a must-have in my opinion",Recommended,28,5

Found this from youtube shorts and wasn't expecting much but genuinely pretty fun. I wish the more direct forms of attacking (bow, grenade, missile) were a little less powerful to force more creative builds, but otherwise its very well made, pretty balanced, and very fun.",Recommended,32 people found this review helpful 0,0

Bopl Battle: A Frenzy of Fun and Chaos

Bopl Battle delivers a delightfully chaotic and highly entertaining multiplayer experience that will have you and your friends in stitches. This couch/online game puts you in control of goofy slimes, battling it out in the most imaginative and unpredictable ways.

Gameplay and Mechanics:

The essence of Bopl Battle lies in its wild and unique abilities and weapons. Players can squish and splatter each other using an arsenal of inventive tools, from rocket engines that send platforms flying to black holes that swallow the entire stage. The creativity in the game mechanics is unparalleled, offering endless combinations for players to explore.

One of the standout features is the ability to invent your own strategies. Whether it's attaching a rocket engine to a platform, creating flammable smoke, or using a growth ray to permanently enlarge objects, the possibilities are vast. The ability to stop time and set up deadly scenarios adds another layer of strategy, making each match a thrilling and unpredictable affair.

The team vs team mode takes the fun to another level, encouraging cooperation and coordination to execute even wilder combos. The game's flexibility in strategy creation ensures that no two battles are ever the same, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.

User Interface and Features:

Bopl Battle's interface is intuitive, making it easy for players to jump right into the action. The visuals are bright and colorful, perfectly complementing the game's whimsical and frenetic nature. However, a notable disclaimer is the presence of flashing lights, which may not be suitable for players with photosensitive epilepsy or other similar conditions.

The game is designed for multiplayer enjoyment, whether locally or online. The requirement for controllers when playing locally (as only one player can use keyboard and mouse per computer) might be a minor inconvenience, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer fun the game offers.

Multiplayer Focus:

It's important to note that Bopl Battle is strictly a multiplayer game, with no single-player mode or bots available. This design choice underscores the game's emphasis on social interaction and shared enjoyment. Whether you're bringing friends over for a couch gaming session or using the built-in online matchmaking, the game ensures that you're always battling against real players.

Conclusion:

Bopl Battle is a fantastically fun and chaotic multiplayer game that shines with its imaginative abilities and strategic depth. Its quirky gameplay and endless combinations of tactics will keep you and your friends entertained for hours. While the lack of a single-player mode and the need for controllers in local play may pose minor limitations, the game's overall experience is overwhelmingly positive. If you're looking for a game that promises laughter, excitement, and a good dose of friendly rivalry, Bopl Battle is an absolute must-play.",Recommended,24,0

Visually, 'Bopl Battle' is a treat. The characters burst onto the screen with vibrant animations and distinctive styles, making every encounter a visual spectacle. The arenas, inspired by iconic settings, provide the perfect backdrop for the impending wordy showdown, each one teeming with interactive elements that keep the battles dynamic.

Gameplay in 'Bopl Battle' is a frenetic dance, where players engage in fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping brawls. Forget traditional attacks – in this game, characters unleash a barrage of unique moves and power-ups, turning each confrontation into a wild display of chaos. The controls are intuitive, allowing players of all skill levels to jump in and wreak havoc.

Multiplayer mode in 'Bopl Battle' is where the game truly shines. Engage in intense battles with friends locally or challenge fighters from around the world in online matchups. The dynamic arenas and ever-evolving landscapes keep the gameplay fresh, ensuring that every match is a new chaotic adventure.

Bopl Battle is not just another brawler; it's a celebration of chaos and a testament to the creativity that can be unleashed in the world of gaming. With its innovative approach to the fighting genre and a multiplayer experience that is as competitive as it is exhilarating it exceeds expectations with the greatest piece of media to bless our existence",Recommended,24,0

Bopl Battle is a lot like Stick Fight: The Game and if you like that, you should play this. If you haven't, Bopl Battle is a 2-D fighting game with many cool abilities, which are: Dash, Bow, Gust, Growth Ray, Shrink Ray, Blink Gun, Throw, Pull, Black Hole, Meteor, Teleport, Drill, Revive, Missile, Thruster, Mine, Boulder, Roll, Platform, Time Stop, Tesla Poles, Grapple, Spike, Grenade, Smoke Grenade, Invisibilty, and Beam. (Might have missed 1 or 2) You can also choose a random option which gives you a random ability every round. You can choose 3 abilities to use in the game and can change the settings to make it 2 or 1. The game is about using combos with these abilities to eliminate your opponents, that be by dashing up to high ground, making a platform and shooting at them from above, or by connecting all the islands with Push and Growth Ray and using Roll to spin around all the islands, crushing your enemies, or by growing yourself by bouncing the Growth Ray off the water onto yourself and using 2 Revives to clone yourself, giving yourself more of you to eat your foes. You can play with up to 4 friends, whether that is on the same device or using LAN. The only big thing that is annoying is that you cannot host or join lobbies. So either have friends over, or near you with their own device and play using LAN. Overall, this is an amazing game with laughs and good times. A good thing is that the game is still being changed constantly, so there is still room for more unique abilities and hope for online. So if you like 2-D fighting games like Super Smash Bros, Worms, Rounds or Stick Fight: The Game, Buy this. My personal opinion: this is the best of all of them.",Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 1,0

This game is good. It's a lot of fun to play with friends and if none of your friends are online. You can just play with everyone in the Discord. The only issue is that it doesn't have a proper multiplayer system aside from steam invites.

Intense and high speed fights. This is what lures you in. Abilities are thrown across the screen, platforms are flying around and explosives are exploding. There is never a dull moment.

The number of abilities you're able to combo together is what makes you stay. Each of them unique and with different benefits and drawbacks, enabling you to find a play-style of your own liking. Try to find the best counter to whatever silly strategies your friends (enemies!) are doing, or just do your own thing.

The game is snappy and visually pleasing ;) Music is catchy and sound effects are on point. This game is very fun.",Recommended,10,0

As fun as it is tilting - Bopl Battle is a really engaging, chaotic game where there's a lot of fun to be had, and a lot of chaos to sow and reap. A word of warning, though, not only is this best with real friends - if you're of uneven temperament, i would advise against this. It's very easy to get enraged by the game if you die a lot in a row, or run into a particually cheesy combo. That's just the nature of things like this, so bear that in mind if that would bother you. It's also a little much for what it is IMO, though if you've got friends it'll likely be worth a lot more to you.",Recommended,7 people found this review helpful 0,0

Its a very interesting and fun party game the demo version also gives you a lot to mess around with and is ofc free I spent around 10 hours on the demo before buying the actual game, it's lots of fun with friends and there's an online matchmaking mode which gets you into game surprisingly quickly, the developer is still releasing updates like new abilities or alter some current ones. As well as this there's a discord server with voice channels that is also quite popular so it doesn't take long to find people to talk and play with.

Extreme polish for this kind of game, especially for a 1 dev team. This is likely thanks to the simplicity and the embrace of 'emergent' gameplay.
I get why, but its a shame its not *really* emergent. Every interaction is intentional, everything else is ruthlessly culled. Its a fun party game, but because of this its not much beyond that shallow limit.

You can play with up to 4 people and is a great option for those who like casual party games with friends that also can have a competitive element. It is exciting, fun, and always a good time with it's different customizable abilities, colours and combinations. It is very accessible with it's controller-friendly options and changeable hotkeys. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes having an incredibly fun time with friends or anyone else online.",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

Bopl Battle is a couch or online platform battler with 26 abilities that you can use in tandem with one another. It is extremely fun and I totally recommend it to anyone with an interest for those games. Here are some details I think should be explained:
-While it does have couch(local) and online, there is no online matchmaking. To get in someone else's lobby, you must be Steam friends with them. HOWEVER, there is a Bopl Battle Discord server that has tons of eager bopls ready to fight.
-Starting ability count can be changed in settings, from 1-3. This changes the dynamic of the game, but something to keep in mind is that even with starting ability less than 3, you can gain abilities throughout rounds.
-Matches can be from 2-4 players, and there are 4 teams in which anyone can join any team(except for everyone on the same team). Having multiple players on one team can really spice up the ability combos!
-There is no health system; all kills are one shot. I personally think this makes the game much more fast paced and encourages plays that are high risk, high reward.
-Even if you don't want to pay the 10 bucks, try the demo! You will not be disappointed.
This game has a ton of replayability and I think that if you have friends up for it, you should definitely try it out. Thanks for reading, and happy bopling!",Recommended,4 people found this review helpful 1,1

Here's a chocolate chip cookie recipe:
Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

In a large bowl or using a stand mixer, beat the butter with the granulated sugar and brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.

Add the vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing just until combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon.

Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft.

Cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.",Recommended,4 people found this review helpful 1,0

Whats good
Worth Money.
Funny concept.
Works smooth enough.
Funny combinations
I had more fun than I had with a lot of games for years. I laughed out loud several times.
Battles feel fair. If you die. its mostly because you get outplayed or made a mistake yourself.

What can be better
Online settings could be impoved with game modes: Teamplay, random items mode, etc
The thing is.. You can do all these settings with friend. but strangers can not be communicated with. and sometimes that means you end up doing 3 vs 1 or You want random items, but they use a strong combo for all the matches.
Music feels iconic, but gets annoying after 1 hour.

One of the best, whackiest, and funniest party brawlers out there! Perfect to play with your friends online or IRL in the same room!

The game lets you choose between a bunch of abilities that kills your fellow blobs, completely transforms the map, or kills your fellow blobs by transforming the map. Most abilities directly or indirectly interact with all other objects in the world, and you can come up with pretty creative ways to turn your friends into colorful splats on the walls. It's a wonderful chaotic fight to the last drop of blob splatter.",Recommended,4 people found this review helpful 0,0

I am not even going to lie, some of the most fun I have had so far this year somehow came from Crab Game... This game is just a whole lot of fun - especially with friends and family, that is when the game is at its absolute best. Nothing beats gathering 5-10 friends/family members and just running around hiding, smacking each other, pushing each other off the map, etc. In theory this game is so simple, yet a lot of fun. It runs perfectly - I mean, the game hardly sets the industry standards for graphics or anything but still - and I would not be surprised if you could run this absolute beauty on a toaster.

The best part is that it is a 400mb download (for you guys with ""bad"" internet connections) and totally FREE! There is no hating on a free game - heck, I would genuinely pay for this game. I have paid for games a whole lot worse than this before. I hope to see frequent updates and more modes in the future. Well done, Dani!",Recommended,377,0

It all started in 8 of October of 1997, when my governament forced me to go to the army, I was desperate, I had 3 kids and a wife at home, I couldn't just leave them like this to go to war, but I couldn't do nothing about it, so I kissed my wife and kids and just left. Five years later, I came back home, just to find out that my wife was sleeping with another man and my 7 year old daughter was addicted to cocaine, I was completely devastated, my life crumbled to pieces while I was gone, what could I do? I couldn't just go back in time and fix everything, so I did my best to try again and decided to completely leave my wife and kids and I moved to Argentina, and I married this beautiful brazilian woman named Raissa, she was everything I wanted in a partner, we had 6 kids and 2 cats, everything was going well until my ex wife died, I was speechless and I felt really bad and with an incredible amount of guilt, so I decided to go back to the USA and go to her funeral, I found out that one of my kids died too, of a cocaine overdose, after this I really didn't know what to do, did I influence the death of my loved ones just because I was a selfish guy? What could I do to revert this situation? So I decided to take my other 2 kids and move them with me to Argentina, I had 8 kids to take care of, it was really hard in the beginning, they weren't used to the presence of each other and the language barrier wasn't helping either, but with time things settled in and we were all an happy family for a while, but then a hurricane came and completely destroyed my house, I had no money and my wife left with my kids, but on my way to the train I saw a guy on the station with a suit case, I wondered what he was doing there, but he approxed me and told me that he wanted to play a game, and if I won, I would win 100$, I accepted it of course, and the game was Ddakji, I lost again and again and this weird man just kept slapping the ♥♥♥♥ out of me, never told anyone but I have a weird fetish and I kinda like being slapped in the face, but eventually I won, he gave me 100$ and a card, I flipped the card and it had a phone number on it, weird but aight, I had no home and no cellphone so I just went to the nearest phone cabin and called the number, they came and picked me up to this weird game, I arrived there, and there was this big ""Crab Game"" thingy and a bunch of options underneath it, I just picked the one that said ""Find Game"" and joined a random server, I was immediatly welcomed by a bunch of 9 years old screaming in my ear, so I just pressed the button in front of me and waited, then the first game started, ""Red light, Green light"", with this weird ass doll in front of me, I was hesitant, but I started running towards the finish line with incredible speed that I never knew I could reach, but has the doll turns around, I stop just at the perfect time, I was the first in the group, I felt amazing, incredible even, but then I feel the breath of someone behind me, I immediatly felt like I was in trouble, I just wanted that stupid doll to turn around again, seconds felt like hours, but it turned around, I just ran and hoped for the best, but then the doll turned around again, I stopped at the right time again and I felt a little bit relieved for being able to make it again, I was so close to the finishing line! My hopes and dreams were at an absolute high, I've never felt like this before in my life, but has I had this brief moment of happiness, I felt the touch of a hand in my back, my brain started to panic, but my body stayed still, I wondered, why would the person behind me ever do this? What did I do to deserve this kind of treatment? but then, I heard a familiar female voice, and she said ""Goodbye, Father"" and pushed me to the ground, when I heard these words, all of the memories I had with the family I left behind started appearing in my head, all of those amazing moments I had with them before I joined the army popped up, on those last seconds of my life, I finally understood why my daughter hated me, how could I be so selfish to leave my three daughters behind like this? I only thought about myself and completely ignored their feelings, I just wished I had some more seconds to tell her that I'm sorry, but it was too late, the doll's head snapped towards me and shot me right there.

It's not Squid Game..but it's Squid Game!

In this Video Game is literally every game from Squid Game! I like it.
The Voicechat is aids and everyone is crying, Lobby owners leave the Lobby in the middle of the game which is pretty annoying. But overall thanks for the great game :) Its fun! Oh and....MUCK.
Oh...and It would be nice If you could choose the Games you want to play.
Its very fun to play with your mates tho! 18+ Lobbies are nice.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",Recommended,459,19

Old Fashioned Pumpkin Pie

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
mixing pumpkin pie ingredients
pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
Strategy
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.
A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.
However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.
It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.
In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.
Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.
When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.
Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.
Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.
If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.
For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.
For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.
They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.
The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.
A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted
A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.
This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.
The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.
Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally,",Recommended,241,4

Crab Game

Crab Game is a game that is really very fun. This game was definitely not inspired by a Korean original Netflix series. It's really great that you can have fun for so long and all without microtransactions. The community market on steam is only limited to cosmetic items, but these can also be earned through a very good box system in the game. Crab Game has a cool voice chat with which you can talk to everyone and that usually causes everyone to scream and that reminds me of old, forgotten and funny days. I recommend playing it before the hype is over.",Recommended,104,3

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2020 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. We spent 7 hours on the game that night and we had killed the first 3 bosses. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.



Thank you, Crab Game.",Recommended,215,0

What I wish the next update's changelog looks like:

+ The server default is now WITHOUT bots.
+ the Rifleman now uses your Steam username instead of your Epic Games username.
+ Added bullet penetration through players and objects
+ Added killfeed icons for no-scope and penetration kills, with corresponding experience rewards.
+ Better networking so players don't get knifed from shooting distance.
+ The players crosshair now doesn't move and is now a more orthodox crosshair in the middle of the screen.
+ Player's ping is now noted in numbers instead of the signal graph
+ Ping for servers
+ Host migration always chooses the player with the most stable internet connection.
+ Players with a bad connection don't teleport and flicker around. Added animation and location insertion.
+ Added a clear way of distinguishing bots from players by means of a different name colour.
+ The spawn protection indication is now based on team colour instead of blue.
+ Improved hitboxes for many objects, especially trees.
- Removed the ""take revenge x times"" missions. Some players never get dominated so this mission forced you to lose.
+ Nerfed knives.
+ AI Nerf: Bots now sometimes miss on close range.
+ AI Nerf: Bots don't pull their knife as often as before.
+ AI Improvement: Bots don't all move in the same direction and walk in chains.
+ AI Improvement: Bots don't look through, and try to shoot through walls anymore.
+ Blurred the background slightly of the sniper scope when zooming in.
+ Rename the game Riflemen, without the 'the'.
+ Added unicode and font support for non-alphabet languages
+ Various bug fixes and improvements.

Planned for the future:

More content
More achievements
Add Steam Trading cards
Make the in-game weapon skins into Steam items instead of unlockables.
Make the Premium DLC into a Prime status like CS:GO.",Recommended,30 people found this review helpful 6,0

Summary
The Riflemen is a First Person Shooter where your goal is either to capture points on the map or to get a certain amount of kills before the enemy team. It's a standard FPS game and offers variety in form of maps and different supply drops that you can use to try and get an edge against the enemy team.
Pros
+ Poly FPS
+ Free to play
+ Multiple decently designed maps
Cons
- MAJOR features locked behind paywall. This includes core features of the game such as making a private match, turning off bots in your game, or making your lobby singleplayer.
- All cosmetics are locked behind a paywall. Although you have to earn all of them, you still have to pay. There is absolutely no free cosmetics or any content for free to play players to work towards.
- Horrible optimisation. There is no cap set on your GPU usage, so it will use up 100% of your GPU, despite it not requiring nearly that much power. There is no way to change this in game, and can only be fixed through the developer making a patch or using third party software.
- Dead playerbase and terrible servers
- Horribly made achievement. Achievements are lazily slapped on with an 1000 kill requirement for all weapons without considering the rarity or difficulty it is to get kills on each weapon.
The Riflemen is just another cheap FPS game with very little effort put into it. As with most games published by this publisher, the games are generally low effort and by newer developers. This game is no exception. With all the poor design choices that this game has, I cannot possible recommend this game. There isn't any enjoyment to be had here, I would suggest looking for alternatives.",Not Recommended,54,3

If you Log in without epic, you get a randomly generated name.

You can still play for free by joining lobbies.

For the $5 you get access to creating lobbies, and cosmetics locked behind levels.
Only 1 person has to own the game for a large group of friends to have a good time.

We've had hours of fun with a majority of people free to play, the care packages are cool(rocket launcher is kinda lame), the devs have nerfed bots being super insane a little bit. A fun low resource game to play with friends.",Recommended,15,0

A game with interesting idea of using mostly rifles and knives with mix of smoke granate granting random weapon which can be used to secure large number of kills like shotgun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, granates or mines or even katana.

Graphically It's really nice game with graphics that you can run even on toaster with beautiful and interesting rotation of maps with multiple different gamemodes.

The game would be great If there were more players cause most of time you will play the game with It's bots who have really bad and unfair aimbot.",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,0

The game is fun and all but there are many problems

Spawn camping. Is a massive issue if people sit far back enough they can just keep killing and killing.
Delay. When you get a kill there is a 1-2 second delay before it shows up.
Premium. The paywall for cosmetics is a bit ridiculous, if you want stuff the lowest level you have to get to is level 10 for an in game profile icon, and even if you do buy the premium pack its a battle pass system.

Apart from all that, the game is fun and fast paced with everyone being 1 shot.",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,0

2559,39,The Riflemen,"Posted: September 5, 2023
Honestly this game has a lot of potential. There are a few things that could be improved upon.

Likes:
1. The fast paced action adds a lot to the experience. The respawn time is perfect to get back to fighting.
2. The game is simple yet challenging if that makes sense. Positioning is key.
3. Servers are mostly full except for the occasional bot.
4. There is only one primary and secondary available to keep it balanced. I think this is the best way to keep the game
balanced.
5. The game is colorful so you can tell things apart from each other.
6. Maps are designed to make it so no team can camouflage better than the other team, keeping the action going and the game less campy.

Dislikes/Annoyances:
1. Some maps are small and suffocating.
2. I don't know if its just me, but I always seem to get stuck with either the grenades or shotgun as my random drop. In the
6-7 full games I have played, I have only received the katana once, and the RPG twice.
3. The lag on some servers can lead to intense rubberbanding, leading to an unhitable target.
4. Perhaps my biggest dislike is the iron sight on the main rifle. Its terrible in my personal opinion. The very small triangle makes it very difficult to hit the target. A possible feature that could be added to help with this is a way to change the iron sight on the rifle to a personal preference for all players. Players could look in a catalog of iron sights and select which one they wish to use, with no iron sight being better than the rest to keep it 100% balanced.

fun, but questionable even as a free game. 5gb download for something that looks like off-brand battlebit. the bots aim better than players, and the weapons just feel extremely clunky. the spawns are typically right next to the opposing team simultaneously without spawn protect or delay to instantly kill opponents.

The maps are somewhat unique and there are about 10 different ones for some variety.

Its nice game, especially when using snipers in other games. Good practice.
But the lag and stuff, one TDM was going on like over 100-100 points already (feels too long game) and then it lagged and i had to exit the game because nothing happened. So no progression were saved.

Sometimes when you hit somebody and there is lag, it takes 1-2 secs to get the kill confirmed.

Hopping to next game without seeing the end of the game and stats.

And you get this gear box every now and then were you get different kind of guns to use, thats fun. There is sword, shotgun, launcher, sniper with scope and some mines and maybe other stuff that i didnt get...

It is an early game with some potential. Very good if you have got a ♥♥♥♥ pc and no money. Still can not get addicted. It is relaxing in some way, becouse it runs so smoothly.

This game is a very basic First Person Shooter, but for people new to the genre its absolutely perfect. It has all the basic mechanics youd expect from a game like this, and its also great fun with friends. It also has a high skill ceiling, and if you really put down some hours you could dominate any lobby.
All in all a simple yet fun fps game, great for beginners. 9/10 game, expecting some updates to improve the game a lot in future!",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

Fun game, reminds me of ravenfield. Though its missing alot of content, only 2 gamemodes so fair and no unlockables, everything including hosting singleplayer lobbies and all currently ""Available"" cosmetics are locked behind a paywall, its only $5 is unlock everything but its still kind of annoying. It doesnt give players any sense of progression for playing. Other then general lack of content the gameplay is pretty solid, only bad thing I could say about it is that there is a weird crosshair snapping thing..? everything you move your mouse the crosshair just snaps to the place youre looking instead of turning over if that makes any sense, doesnt break the game or anything just super annoying.

A great game to play with friends but could use some tunning.

The Bots:
-Aimbot needs to be nerfed
-Bots should be able to use supply drop weapons as well as call them

The Gunplay
+solid and easy to learn
-Weapon balance needs changes some weapons are worse than others

The modes and maps
+variety of diffrent maps keeps the game intresting
+multiple gamemodes keep the game intresting

Monetization
+the game is free which keeps the player base higher
+the premium is affordable and isnt needed to play

Accesebility
+the game works well even on a potato pc
+singleplayer allows player to play offline

Can be rather buggy, but overall this a really decent game. The movement is fluent and resembles an arena shooter, while the gunplay is that of a tactical shooter. My main complaint is the matchmaking, simply because I constantly get kicked from lobbies because the game is ""host migration in progress"" or whatever.
This is really worth the price of... ZERO DOLLARS.
Currently there isn't too much in the realm of overall content, however for what it is this is a really good game!

I would consider buying the ""Premium Pack"" simply to help out the devs, but I don't exactly have much, if any, disposable income at the moment.",Recommended,1 person found this review helpful 0,0

What is this game ? my pc is literally heating with this small game which is wild, i have a high end pc but i feel its getting choked by this game, the game is honestly very good and i think it will have a bright future but its intensive for some reason, also if there is a sandbox gamemode the game will definitely stand out.",Recommended,"No one has rated this review as helpful yet

This game is not just unpolished, but scuffed. The normal difficulty is trivial when it comes to getting the top of the leaderboard, but on hardcore, it is entirely map dependent as the bots are able to kill you across the map on sight without any defense other than to move wildly which hardly helps.",Not Recommended,1 person found this review helpful 1,0

Boring slog fest with just another tdm mode that feels just like any other despite the what should be the unique twist of bolt action rifles, which ultimately falls flat with practical movement shooter controls, and the still present feature of headshots which can quickly ruin any heated confrontation this game is actually capable of presenting. in its current state its a ""good feeling"" game with poor design features that don't really fit the pitched premise.

It's fun to test the limits of this game. Just as an example, I was supposed to get a cat out of a tree. Most people would spawn a ladder and go get the cat. I went a different route. I typed the word ""jetpack"" not expecting it to work. Surprisingly, it did work. I gave the jetpack to the cat, and the cat strapped it on. But it still wouldn't go anywhere. So, I clicked on the cat and typed ""daredevil"" making the cat brave enough to use the jetpack and then suddenly the cat goes flying across the screen and my mission was complete. I never expected that bone headed idea to work, but it just showed me that this game was way more than meets the eye. Definitely worth the small price.",Recommended,130,0

For the first time on the PC... I remember Myself playing the first game in This series (Scribblenauts) for the first time on the Nintendo DS and I truly loved it. I just wrote words on a notepad in the game and they appeared out of nowhere in the game-world itself... and I was like: ""WOW!"" This is one, is one of those games that has supported and helped Me improve plus learn the English language as a very young child (I'm not from any English-speaking country)

THE STORY
-------------
It tells of the main character's (Maxwell) parents past, starting a family til They had about 42 children. Every kid is very unique when it comes to personality, ethnicity and appearance. Especially Maxwell's sister (Lily) one day Both of Them plays a prank on one old hungry man by giving Him a ""rotten apple"" This man becomes enraged because of this and places a curse upon Maxwell's sister Lily. Each of her every ""body parts"" is about to turn into stone each hour passing by. Maxwell tends to help His sister, but how is that possible? How will he be able to unrelease this curse that is turning His sister into stone?

GAMEPLAY
------------
You start as Maxwell You can add pretty much anything into the game with Your magical notepad. You need to use items that is fitting well to solve the problem of the situation You're trying to finish. For some examples: Help a plant to sprout. My solution: add anything that can water over it. Help the kitty down from the tree. My solution: add small wings on the kitty so it can fly down from the sky. An old man wants to sail across the sea. My solution: get Him a sailing raft. Y'know... Stuff like THAT.

Not only can You play as Maxwell but on each level in the game on your map (almost) You can unlock all His 40 siblings and play as Them. And You can also change Your avatar by clicking on Your current avatar and go down to the avatar-menu or whatever the hell it's called...! And then You can customize Your avatar how You want Them to look like. Plus in the game itself You can add clothes acessories or a tail, maybe even wings on Your avatar and do alot of other crazy stuff for fun, solving the people in the game's problems.

MY OPINION AND RATING
---------------------------
I like This game. However I prefer the first game over this one. The one for the DS, y'know? I know. I'm kinda weird for liking the DS-game a little better instead of This one for the PC because This one is improved and much bigger than the original first game. But You know what They say: ""The originals beats the sequels!"" Heh. But still This game has alot of potential and can inspire so much, that you don't even know what more to say about it.

My rating however, for this game 's going to be a 6/10 because it can't beat the first game (in My opinion) Scribblenauts for nintendo DS: 8.5/10. {however if You've played the first one, I do think You'll like this one a little more (;} the game has good music and can get You joyful for playing it, but it might get a little repeating and monotonous after a while. At least for Me...!",Recommended,145,1

""Write anything, solve everything."" This has been the mantra for Scribblenauts since its creation in 2009, and each new installment comes closer and closer to realising this goal. Scribblenauts Unlimited on Steam has taken the ""write anything"" part to heart, but falters a bit of the ""solve everything"" side of the equation.

The Steam Workshop support for this game is quite huge. If you can think of an object that the game doesn't recognise (mostly copyrighted content), then it's possible that someone has either created it for you, or some toying around with the game's impressive object editor will make your dreams a reality. Even better, you can upload your creations for all Steam users to enjoy.

As awesome as this is, the gameplay is a tad disappointing. At least, we finally have an explanation for Maxwell's endless search for Starites (the game's MacGuffin). The story acts as a prequel to the series, as Maxwell struggles to retrieve the errant Starites to rescue his sister, Lilly (one of literally dozens of his relatives, all of whom are playable characters), from being turned into stone. This story is quickly forgotten once you start summoning vuvuzuela-playing pink jaguars to fight a winged preposterous black knight riding atop a cowardly telekinetic cybernetic T-rex, with only the occasional interlude reminding you of your main objective.

To retrieve the Starites, Maxwell must help people around the game's expansive world with various problems, from helping an up-and-coming rock band gain a fanbase, to helping patients in a hospital with their various ailments. While its nice to have a large amount of different areas to explore, many of which feel alive with various characters mulling about, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just playing nicer-looking versions of the DS games' title screens. Worse yet, many of the main challenges don't encourage your imagination as often as you think they would.

Despite these problems, I would still highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played the series before. The visuals are crisp, the sheer amount of objects that can be generated is mind boggling (not counting the extensive Workshop creations), and it's still fun to see how each object and adjective interacts with each object in the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ Graphics look amazing, even on low-powered laptops
+ Amazing object editor
+ ""Write anything"": only limited to your imagination
+ Always fun to see object/adjective interactions
+ Nice origin story for Maxwell...

A charming game that expresses the innocent sense of curiosity and imagination of a young child in a way I have rarely seen.

If you're not familiar with the Scribblenauts series, they are platformer sandbox puzzle games where you can summon just about any object from the dictionary (with some reasonable exceptions such as copyrighted things, alcohol, and proper nouns) and expect them to interact in a believable way. If you can think of any food, animal, household item, weapon, mythological creature, or vehicle, chances are you can make it appear. We're talking tens of thousands of possibilities. A few surprises can also be summoned, such as a variety of internet memes and special objects, if you can think of them.

You can summon objects, or add adjectives to existing objects, to solve puzzles and make all the townspeople happy. Or, you could just screw around for hours summoning gods and beasts and riding them across the world as your epic mounts, or watching them run loose and terrorize the villagers.

The puzzles are all ridiculously easy, but difficulty is obviously not the point. Personally, my favorite way to play this game is to think of the most obnoxiously ridiculous solutions to every puzzle. Most puzzles will have a bluntly obvious solution, but you can make hilarity ensue if you can think of something creative. For instance, a guy wanted something to help carve his ice sculpture. I gave him a toenail clipper. Hansel and Gretel needed something to make a trail with through the forest. I gave them thumbtacks. A buzzard wanted something to eat. I gave it a dead baby. A tracking dog needed something that smelled like Santa so he could search for Santa. I summoned Santa.

It's an excellent game packed with great humor and content, and it's miles ahead of the Nintendo DS games it was based on. My only complaint is that it got a bit boring after the first few hours, but I fixed that just by taking some breaks and not playing it all on one sitting. But I never once stopped appreciating how wonderful the game is. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to rediscover their inner child, complete with borderline politically incorrect humor, in a way that very few games can provide.

(Achievement hunters: getting 100% is very tedious, as you will need to solve over a hundred riddles to acquire the remaining bonus pieces. Usually you will solve some of them on accident throughout normal gameplay if you try to use creative solutions. However, if you ever get bored, you can just look at a FAQ to fully complete the game effortlessly.)",Recommended,96,4

A game with lots of creativity. You control a boy who can turn anything to life by writing it on his notebook. Lots of crazy things to do in this game like shooting down a building with ""Destroyer"", turning a lizard into a Ice Dragon and make him fight a ""Flamethrower Soldier"", building a school underwater, make a health potion and drink it if you are hurt and low on health, add dead as an adjective... Instant death! and more fun and crazy stuff to do. The art design is nice. And lots of variety in characters and customization. Its more like a sandbox game where you can do anything you want. Also has cool story. Its not a game for Everyone though. You might get bored of it quickly if you don't like these kind of games. And...! You can get past most of the game without killing people! Type ""Sleepy"" or ""Sleeping"" as adjective insteed! Had a great time in this game. Will play more.

+ Creativity at Its Finest
+ Great Art Design
+ Lots of Characters and Customization
+ Improve Your Spelling Skills! :P
+ Good Story
+ Makes You Think
+ Truely Open World
+ Lasts Long

- Not for Everyone. Some People Might Get Bored of It Quickly
- Resetting the Whole level After the Death of a Quest Related NPC for Level Completion. Respawn Feature Would Have Been Nice...

What I love about scribblenauts is its creative problem solving and peaceful attitude.
Problem: Did the children of the neighborhood land their ball on the old geezer's lawn that won't give it back?
Solution: Spawn a gun and kill him! It works!
Problem: Nurse being chased by an angry heart?
Solution: Spawn a gun and kill it!
Problem: Want to contact a manager at the other side of a wall?
Solution: Spawn a grenade launcher!
Problem: Frozen people encased in ice?
Solution: Spawn a flamethrower! Bonus: Watch their life points diminish as you melt/burn away!
The thing that bugged me the most and made me sad is the cruelty towards animals. For example, as I visited a restaurant I made friends with a brown recluse spider and a cockroach, petting them and watching their happy little faces light up. Then some evil quest-giving person wanted me to kill them for a pest-control inspection, the nerve! And for a starlite fragment I had to kill my newly made bug friends?! What cruel madness is this!
Also while going through the object shards achievements I had to prod a cow?! Shame on you scribblenauts. I hope they will fix those issues in future installments. In the meanwhile I will continue riding my black&red huge supersonic fire-breathing dragon that is immune to damage, while going around helping people and making their lives better (sometimes with the use of supreme firepower).",Recommended,174,9

I had NO idea this game even existed. And it has blown my mind...
WTH IS THIS GAME!?!?! WHat the hell??? This game is unlike any other you have played. It is not about maneuvering, tab targeting, using specials, etc. No. This game is entirely based on your words, your imagination! Your character has a super-powered magical notebook to write or draw in. Whatever Maxwell writes comes true. It reminds me of an old cartoon they used to have as part of Captain Kangaroo, a little cartoon about a boy named Simon, and whatever he would draw with his magic chalk would come to life!

It's Simon, plus Adventure Time. This game MUST have been inspired by adventure time. This game is a little bit dated now, and a little bit buggy depending on what platform you're on. But, the upside is that this game HAS been around for a long time and therefore there is a lot out there about and for this game. Lots of guides, and lots of stuff on the Steam Workshop!

This game, it's so different that I have to actually take a break from time to time. It really shows how mind numbing most games are. Just SEE ENEMY PIXELS, PRESS BUTTON. over and over. On Scribblenauts, you have to imagine something, then you just write it.

It's fun to just go somewhere in the game and sit there and experiment. Making actual people, animals,, machines, etc. and modifying them, giving them items, messing with their motives. Sometimes they just randomly fight, or maybe other creatures get spawned in by all the weird interactions going on, There's even been a few times I've seen one of the quests for the level I'm in just spontaneously get solved by some crazy thing I spawned in! Like, on this prison level, I sat right at the entrance and was messing around and spawned some SWAT team guys, a tank for them to use, and a general to command them. As soon as I spawned in the general, something happened, and one of the quests resolved. LMAO.

Also, I love that you can spawn something, then open it in the editor and REALLY change it around, and then you can summon THAT item with the pad. THEN, there's even this quick pad thing. You spawn something in, maybe even one of your custom items, a police helicopter with a swat guy in it, and then you grab that, and drag it up to the back pack icon in the upper left. He will actually go up in there. When you look, you will see a picture of him, and you can drag and drop him back into the world! It's crazy! You can make as many copies as you want.

I went ahead and got Scribblenauts Unmasked as well, and in that one you can summon in like EVERY DC COMICS CHARACTER EVER. I'm not even kidding.

This game is ridiculous, you should play it, it's certainly something different. It is even appropriate for kids.",Recommended,38,0

I highly recommend this fun for all ages kinda game. It is like mad libs come to life. You wander around what is basically a 2D open world mad libbing people's issues. Issues like I need something to scare away crows.... well just spawn a zombie or a scarecrow, or an angry hunter, or a gun to do it yourself! There's a lot of unintentional yet intentional fun here. Spawning a zombie to solve one puzzle might chase away other NPCs. Unless you add the adjective, friendly zombie. Its really the interactivity with the world that makes the game such silly fun. Did your zombie make a fire? Well have a firefighter put out that fire. Its a silly fun game that I can imagine would be great for kids. Simple controls that really thrive with a keyboard when you're typing things like 'pretty pink princess.' There are good area settings too, everywhere from standard city areas like hospitals and a fire station, to more creative areas like Jurassic Park, a haunted house and a castle. Overall, the game is pretty easy. Easy enough that anyone can see it through to the end.",Recommended,87,0

Scribblenauts is my religion

In my opinion the best game ever made, who needs ultra hd graphics when you have infinite creativity, replayability, bugs that are crazy fun but dont break the game, a beautiful ost, a not so active but beautiful community and some puns here and there?

The content never ends, i've been playing this game almost since its release and i still find new features.

It doesnt matter who you are, if you know how to read and spell you will have fun with this game. Adults will have fun trying to destroy everything and children will have fun with the game itself. Of course everyone will have fun for its own reasons but im just saying everyone will enjoy it.


And if you dont want to progress just dont! you can just keep creating random things and it works!

Play this game, seriously give it a try, the tutorial is a little boring but then it gets crazy fun.





Wait, there are some object you cant add adjetives to in the game and its never explained in the E P I C S C R I B B L E N A U T S L O R E? 0/10 garbage game would not reccomend











Also i know it says i've only played 300 hours but i have other 3 steam accounts with more than 200 hours each.

You can do whatever you want! My favourite part of the game is killing innocents and watching them run and call for help, but there is nothing they can do. Or forcing people to cannibalism by starving them to death and adding the adjectives ""delicious"", ""tasty"" or ""edible"" to their friend. This causes them to eat their friend out of hunger! You can also create a box and trap a citizen in it forever, and never let them out! You can watch as they scream, cry for help, and then eventually quiet down and suffocate. You can create hideous abominations and add adjectives like ""hungry"" ""evil"" or ""aggressive"". This will cause the monster to attack innocent citizens for no reason, and kill them! One of the things I love about this game, it that it is a learning experience! It can teach kids new adjectives! This is a very fun, family friendly, wholesome game, and I cannot recommend it enough!

Information

Scribblenauts Unlimited is a puzzle game developed by 5th Cell Media.

Gameplay

The adventurer Edgar was reputed to be the most famous adventurer in the world. When he wanted to retrieve a gold-plated figure from an ancient temple, he only found the adventurer Julie there, who preceded him and was about to eat her lunch. Later, Edgar and Julie competed against each other, adventure after adventure. Julie beat Edgar when she opened a treasure chest, but the treasure she found was an engagement ring. Edgar and Julie get married and initially had only one son named Edwin, but later they raised 42 children, all of whom are their children! They gave each of their children a special relic, the two twins Maxwell and Lily got a globe with which one can travel to any point in the world, and a magical notebook which, as soon as you write a word in it, makes it a reality! However, they got too used to their gifts that their parents fear that they will spoil them too much. So they sent their children to discover the world. On their way into town, Maxwell and Lily met a hungry old man. Maxwell conjures him an apple, which was rotten. The old man cursed Lily, she gradually turns to stone. Maxwell and Lily went to their eldest brother, Edwin. Edwin told them about starites, magical stars that arise from the joy of others. Maxwell sees it as his job to save his twin sister and collect enough starites for her to be fine again.

Also good to know: In contrast to its predecessors, there is no longer a level selection screen, but a large, connected upper world that the player can freely explore. This adds an adventure element to the game in addition to the puzzle. Another innovation in the game is that players can now create new objects themselves using an object editor.


+ Child-friendly
+ open game world
+ good puzzles
+ Create tons of crazy objects and solve puzzles with simple text input
+ coherent soundtrack
+ funny object editor and worldwide exchange function
+ Trading cards and achievements


- Sometimes solutions are difficult to find
- does not always recognize all words at the same time as they are entered
- Control a bit awkward, especially in the editor and the action inserts


Scribblenauts Unlimited turned out to be a good puzzle game, even if it doesn't quite match its predecessor.



Scribblenauts Unlimited ist RätselSpiel, welches von 5th Cell Media entwickelt wurde.


Der Abenteurer Edgar war angeblich der berühmteste Abenteurer der Welt. Als er eine vergoldete Figur aus einem antiken Tempel bergen wollte, fand er dort nur die Abenteurerin Julie vor, welche ihm zuvorkam und gerade ihr Mittagessen essen wollte. Später konkurrierten Edgar und Julie gegeneinander Abenteuer um Abenteuer. Julie kam Edgar beim Öffnen einer Schatzkiste zuvor, doch der Schatz, den sie vorfand, war ein Verlobungsring. Edgar und Julie heiraten und bekamen vorerst nur einen Sohn namens Edwin, aber später zogen sie 42 Kinder groß, welche alle ihre Kinder sind! Sie gaben jedem ihrer Kinder ein spezielles Relikt, die beiden Zwillinge Maxwell und Lily bekamen einen Globus, mit dem man an jeden Punkt der Welt reisen kann, und ein magisches Notizbuch, welches, sobald man ein Wort hineinschreibt, dieses sofort Wirklichkeit werden lässt! Jedoch gewöhnten sie sich zu sehr an ihre Geschenke, so dass ihre Eltern befürchten, dass sie die beiden zu sehr verwöhnen. Also schickten sie ihre Kinder los, so dass sie die Welt entdecken. Auf dem Weg in die Stadt trafen Maxwell und Lily einen hungrigen alten Mann. Maxwell zaubert ihm einen Apfel, welcher jedoch faul war. Der alte Mann verfluchte Lily, sie verwandelt sich nach und nach in Stein. Maxwell und Lily gingen zu ihrem ältesten Bruder Edwin. Edwin erzählte ihnen von Starites, das sind magische Sterne, welche aus der Freude anderer entstehen. Maxwell sieht es als seine Aufgabe, seine Zwillingsschwester zu retten und genug Starites für sie zu sammeln, dass es ihr wieder gut geht.

Auch gut zu wissen: Es gibt im Gegensatz zu den Vorgängern gibt es keine Levelauswahl-Bildschirm mehr, sondern eine große, verbundene Oberwelt, die der Spieler frei erkunden kann. Dadurch bekommt das Spiel neben dem Puzzle- auch ein Adventure-Element hinzu. Eine weitere Neuerung im Spiel ist, dass Spieler nun mithilfe eines Objekt-Editors selbst neue Objekte erschaffen können.


+ Kinderfreundlich
+ offene Spielwelt
+ gute Rätsel
+ mit einfacher Text-Eingabe Unmengen verrückter Objekte erschaffen und Rätsel lösen
+ stimmiger Soundtrack
+ lustiger Objekt-Editor und weltweite Tausch-Funktion
+ Trading Cards und Errungenschaften


- Lösungen teils schwer zu finden
- erkennt nicht immer gleich alle Wörter bei der Eingabe
- Steuerung etwas umständlich, vor allem im Editor und den Action- Einlagen


Scribblenauts Unlimited ist ein gutes Puzzle-Spiel geworden, auch wenn es nicht ganz an die Vorgänger heran kommt.",Recommended,27 people found this review helpful 1,3

Scribblenauts unlimited: Summon words to conjure Lovecraftian horrors

This was given to me by a good friend of mine. He, much like a lot of other people I know adores this game. I did hear quite a bit about Scribblenauts before playing it and was looking forward to playing it. Well now that I have finished the story I would like to chat about it.

Scribblenauts has a very simple story with a simple but universal message about kindness and helpfulness. Maxwell and his sister Lily are two children who love to cause mischief. The two have a magic notebook from their parents that can create anything they write down. This makes them become spoiled as a result. That all changes when they trick an old man to eat a rotten apple, the old man curses Lilly to slowly turn to stone with the only cure being Starite; magic stars that manifest when people are helped. It is up to Max to help people so he can save Lilly from becoming a stature and learning charity in the process. That is the entire story I can give without going into spoilers. It is nice, to the point and gives a good message for all children and adults.

Gameplay is also simple; it is a sidescroller with some light platforming in some levels, none of it is too difficult making it available for everyone. You control Maxwell with either the mouse or keyboard and you type nouns or adjectives as needed. This game is solely a puzzle game where you are creating the puzzle pieces. The game is very forgiving to spelling errors which are nice for someone like me or others who struggle with spelling. You cannot write anything vulgar so do not bother writing stuff that would be under that classification. There is nothing really wrong with the gameplay asides from some of the puzzles being slightly uneven in difficultly but that is kind of it.

The graphics and art style are brilliant, everybody looks like and moves like wooden dolls and the back rounds appear to look like hand painted boxes, it all looks so adorable and so enduring. I could not help but feel warm and fuzzy when I was playing through it. There is always the problem when it comes to such upbeat and cheerful media is that it could become obnoxious and insulting to the children. Scribblenauts balances the cheerfulness out with the underlying threat that Lilly is going to turn to stone and it will be all his fault, it shows children that actions have consequences and not all can be solved easily if at all. This and the fact that some of the humour has a dark edge to it when you stop to think about the jokes but most, if not all of it will go over children’s heads.

The game runs fantastically well with no problems at all, in the end a very well optimised game.

I have enjoyed Scribblenauts tremendously, a must play for children and adults alike.",Recommended,22,0

This game just makes me happy when I play it. It's fun and I laugh a lot while I play it. Do you really need anything else from anything?

It's not a difficult game by any stretch as a simple story game of collecting stars to help save somethign from something with a lot of cool/cute art and object making. It lets you use your imagination to create an enormous amount of objects to just drop into the world and play with. Want a monkey? How about a GIANT monkey? You can make one and then ride it. Hilarious notebook? Sure. It will make every NPC that it passes by laugh. Create a Living Garden Gnome riding on a Tiny Goat. You can even create NPCs that will fight with one another, or even jsut play nice. Using adjectives in front of objects makes them even more interesting than they already are.

You can save objects you create in your backpack for easy access, you can get objects created by other Steam users in the Workshop with simple in-game menus and a couple clicks. Tons of user created stuff is amazing and hilarious so make sure to spend a good amount of time in the Steam Workshop for this game.

This is a Family Friendly game that anyone with a soul should play and enjoy. If you are a ginger, well we know you have no soul, but even YOU would probably be able to find some joy here.

It's an easy 100% Achievements game and they just take the time of finishing all the stars mostly and making objects they tell you to. Trading cards as well of course.

Fun and hilarious casual game for all ages!

NOTE: If you look at the credits and use the Developer's names to create in-game characters they will all appear in the game with some sort of special attribute. One dev NPC has the ability to turn every hat you put on them to spawn wings that you can take and fly with for example. There are a ton of these and it is fun to mess around with. You can view the credits at any time so write down some developer names and experiment in the game. :)",Recommended,47,5

Being a fully grown adult, technically i shouldn't be enjoying games like this, but i'm just going to say it anyway. I DID! I enjoyed this game. I think it's a game made to be more suited to the younger ones, theres this educational aspect to the game, and even i learnt a few new things. You play a character that has to make its way through a number of zones, helping numerous people complete tasks by typing and giving your character items to solve the puzzle you're completing. The only downside, is the star collecting can get a little boring, if you're into completing the game fully, but it can be enjoyable in moderation. On the other hand, there are some things you can do in the game, which, lets say, makes the game not so child friendly. I'm pretty sure if you spawn a suicidal man and you spawn a gun, he normally kills himself!! So whether it's teaching the kids a thing or two, being a sick individual, or just wanting a game to chill with and enjoy, then this game ticks most boxes. 8/10",Recommended,27,1

This is truly a joy and not only because of the game. 5th Cell Media have developed a game that encourages thinking and learning and actually manages to pull something very fun and enjoyable in the process; something I haven't seen since the age of the Spectrum. Undoubtedly a child will find hours of fun trying to come up with wild and crazy adjectives to supplement their boring nouns. Equally they will perhaps try to find a not-so-obvious route to solve a problem, which again is a credit to the developers. Not enough games encourage this kind of learning and thinking while you play a game.",Recommended,25,0

It's difficult for me to give this a thumbs down, both because it's a nostalgic game I played when I was younger and because I don't think it's a bad game. I know you must be asking, well if it's not a bad game, why don't you recommend it?

Scribblenauts is for kids. At least, this one is, that much was obvious to me coming back to this game and playing it for the first time in years. With certain forms of ""kids"" media they can be made to be enjoyable for both kids AND adults at the same time. Take the movie Shrek for example, it's a movie intended for kids yes, but it has plenty of adult humor in it and as a result I find that movie just as fun to watch now as I did as a kid. Scribblenauts Unlimited is not like that.

The big issue I have with Scribblenauts Unlimited is that it's not really a game when you break it down. The basic gameplay loop of this game can be summed up like this; enter a level, click on an npc and they ask you to spawn something, you spawn it grab the starite/starite piece and move on to the next npc and repeat. And to add to this, every single quest or puzzle that npc's give you is insanely simple. It'll be something like ""I need something to eat this soup with!"" and you give them a spoon. Every single task in the game is like this, only near the end does it get more difficult and I would argue not in a good way because most of the time it's the way the task is written that confuses you and makes you unable to think of what would help the npc.

Another thing that really bothers me about this game is that it never rewards you for being creative, and there's no incentive for creativity even though the main draw of Scribblenauts (no pun intended) is that you get to be creative and do anything you want to. Most of the time when you choose to spawn something more unique or interesting than the basic, easy to solve answer you're met with nothing and it begs the question, why waste time trying to be creative and come up with cool or interesting solutions to the puzzles when there's no incentive to do so, and when giving the boring easy option is both faster and requires less thinking?

It's frustrating because Scribblenauts has such a unique game mechanic that being the notebook, but it feels like they spent all their time developing all these things to spawn and didn't give enough time to design the game to work around it. So instead we got all these filler quests and puzzles to pad out the game, none of which are particularly fun or interesting FOR ADULTS. That's the keyword, I think this game is fantastic for kids 12 and under, but if you're above that age I really cannot recommend this game. It will bore you and you will likely give up about an hour into the game when you realize every quest is the exact same and requires the brainpower of a peanut.",Not Recommended,620,0

This is a really fun and original game that is easy to lose track of time on. I can't think of many games with gameplay that allows for so much variety, freedom, and creativity. Scribblenauts Unlimited is a good game. On the downside it does not have a whole lot of replay value. you can go back and enjoy it again, but eventually you feel like you have done it all. Ultimately it's a fun game that you will play, beat, and then probably leave alone. It's not a huge downside, not all games can have a whole lot of replay value, sometimes the way the games work does not make it very replayable.",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 0,1

you can really do just about anything in this game. The story mode is a fun way to give players quite a few (very easy) challenges and tasks to complete, many times with obscure solutions working better than you'd expect.

In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#342 out of 612)... it's time for Scribblenauts Ulimited.

It's Scribblenauts, and it functions exactly as you'd expect it to from reading the description, and has the exact same flaws you'd likely imagine it to have from reading the same. In brief: a simple puzzle-game where you type nouns, occasionally modified with adjectives, to summon objects into the world to solve problems. The game has a very large dictionary, but is far from thorough, so if you have a sufficiently large English vocabulary, you likely won't get much mileage from the game as you'll frequently type in words that the game does not correctly recognize. All the same, Scribblenauts is a fun puzzle game that encourages lateral thinking and is probably best suited for non-native English speakers hoping to learn the language, and children hoping to expand their language skills.",Recommended,19,0

An adorable little puzzle game originally designed for children, the game revolves around typing out words which will then spawn in the world or affect other items/npc's to help solve challenges.

With a massive database of words, adjectives and items to play with, you can solve a puzzle in pretty much any way imaginable, which makes it pretty fun even if you're an adult - I tried to solve pretty much every problem with guns, and it worked suprisingly well.

- Open up and play whenever, you'll be able to progress a little bit in just a few minutes.
- Even if you're an adult, you'll be wracking your brain trying to think of ways to solve challenges in unique or interesting ways.
- If you rush through all the maps there's probably still a good 6+ hours of gameplay to the end, if you go for 100% you could likely double that.
- This game could last basically forever, the art is simple but appealing, and there's so much variation you can't really get tired of it. I mean you could always set it on fire to make it more interesting.

- It's pretty obvious from the get go that this is designed for the DS, as its touchscreen interface makes obvious. Mouse controls can be a little but clunky, and hitboxes for items are HUGE and regularly overlapping.
- If you're trying to 100% levels, you have to go around the entire level solving peoples problems, but sometimes these can be a bit hard to find. You'll quickly end up putting 'flying' and 'fast' adjectives on yourself and speeding round in the mode that allows you to see the tasks you haven't completed easier, but also unfortunately kind of ruins the aesthetic of the game with a big grey overlay.
- It's sometimes a bit frustrating to try and find the correct combination of words to do something, and quite often you end up reaching for brand names or copywritten words that are unfortunately not in the games database. I don't blame the developers for this, but I found this quite regularly breaking my immersion a little and leaving me frustrated. Thankfully, this is quite easy to fix with the Workshop, where you can go and download thouands more words and items.
- Being British, I write and spell very slightly differently to Americans, and it seems that the game expects American spelling and words. For example, where I would write 'tap', the game might expect 'faucet', which can get confusing at times. There are also a few tasks which required knowledge of American history, which I'm pretty lacking in, and took me several minutes to solve. However, this might not be a bad thing, as I actually had to think about what I was doing.

All in all, I enjoyed playing this game for a few hours and may go back to casually complete it at some point. I would absolutely love to see proper mod support for something like this, and being able to download large packs of new items and words would be pretty cool.",Recommended,13,2

A refreshing game which you wanna play it after hours of office work and commuting. The graphic makes you wanna smile, the gameplay is funny and unique. You can solve things in many ways, it all depends on your creativity (and vocabulary, it seems). Buy this game if you want a light cheerful distraction from other 'serious' games.

I would give it 10 points if the developer fixed the bugs (achievement sometimes not working, getting out items from backpack sometimes got blank, etc)

When I got this game, I thought it was going to be similar to the first game I played on the DS, which I got bored with rather quickly. However, I was surprised at how far this franchise has come and how many hours I lost playing this quaint game. It inspires creativity, gets you thinking outside the box, if you choose, and can be very funny at points. The only downside, in my opinion, is that some of the solutions to some puzzles have a “guess what the dev’s thinking” mentality which, although makes the puzzles more challenging, can get a little annoying.

Overall, a great game for people of any age and I recommend it highly.",Recommended,11 people found this review helpful 0,2

Scribblenauts Unlimited, I am a fan of the Scribblenauts series, and I was glad to have the chance to pick up Unlimited during a sale some time ago. I enjoy Scribblenauts for what it is, a relaxing, play at your own pace kind of puzzle game. The puzzles themselves are not hard whatsoever, its more about the creative, or not so creative ways you can solve different objectives.

That coupled with the object and avatar creator make Scribblenauts Unlimited a pretty great sandbox experience in my opinion, but one I feel like only a certain niche of gamer may appreciate. If you think you may be interested in Scribblenauts Unlimited, I think you should give it a shot. it's a pretty neat game, in a pretty great series.",Recommended,13,0

Fun for the whole family! Kids could probably spend days and days in this, as for adults, you can just mess around with entertaining results, using your superior vocabulary to create awkward scenarios. Like I once got tasked with deconstruction of old building and creation of a new establishment in it's place - I built a morgue, in the middle of suburb, and everyone got so excited they even put up wacky inflatible tube men during grand opening!

Anyways, it's a sort-of sandbox where you travel different areas and give or create people items they need. You can just write any object like ""microscope"" or ""dress"" or ""centaur"" or ""multiple rocket launcher"" and it'll spawn, and then you can add adjectives to most things which will give you even more options. Because all scenarios are handled trough item tags, you can get really creative - say, instead of giving hungry guy a pie or an apple, you can attach an ""edible"" adjective to a toilet or baby, for some family friendy cannibalism. It's all freeform, and altrough vulgarity is banned, you can still make things pretty dark or toilet humory.

So, most of game progression involves helping people on different levels, and some missions require completing different actions beyond just giving characters what they need, like helping a desert settlement defend from bandits by setting up defenses and spawning somebody who'd train the settlers, or navigating a hazard course where you have to devise the ways to walk trough fire and other traps. The progression only unlocks character skins (which you can create your own, even) and new levels, all the items you can spawn are available from start, and they all have some sort of interaction - there's even special achievements and challenges for figuring out different tasks, which demonstrate more unique interactions between objects, like using warmth to make a chicken egg hatch or making werewolf transform due to moonlight. It's pretty entertaining to discover, overall.

It's customary to bring up story and graphics and audio and, you know , they're there and they're fine, nothing remarkable but it's nice. Overall, this is an amusing title, go for it if you like messing in sandboxes even in singleplayer.",Recommended,12,0

Loved the original Scribblenauts games on the DS because of their simplicity and ease of access; everything was at your fingertips. Scribblenauts unlimited attempts to build on this formula by addding the feature of editing items already in the game world through adding modifiers. Unlimited also adds the ability to store items in your backpack for later use. All nice features, but altogether clunky as the game loses its charm without the use of a stylus. Having to mouse entirely across the screen to spawn in an item seems like a hassle when the first time around it took hardly any effort to access the notebook. It's still good ol' Scribblenauts, and while I'd take the old level select systems over this ""open world"" approach, Sribblenauts Unlimited is fun play and a creative pastime. 8/10",Recommended,23,1

A game with lots of creativity. You control a boy who can turn anything to life by writing it on his notebook.

Instant death! and more fun and crazy stuff to do. The art design is nice. And lots of variety in characters and customization. Its more like a sandbox game where you can do anything you want. Also has cool story. Its not a game for Everyone though. You might get bored of it quickly if you don't like these kind of games. And...! You can get past most of the game without killing people!

Scribblenauts Unlimited is a word puzzle game with colourful and cute ""doodle-like"" artstyle. We play as Maxwell who has a magical notebook that can create anything that he writes in it. He is on a journey to do good and help others in need in order to gather enough ""Starites"" to save his sister who is turning into stone.

Scribblenauts Unlimited is pretty unique for a puzzle game as you would be given hints as to how to solve a problem and you would type out an item which you think might be the solution. Do not fret if you are stuck as the game does gives more hints to a puzzle as time goes on and when enough time passes, they would just give you the answer. There is a decent amount of puzzles spread across 38 levels, each with their own unique theme and atmosphere (Range from a big city to an alien planet!).

The puzzles are mostly really easy as this game is mainly aim for young children based on the artstyle and storyline. However some puzzles are pretty challenging and might leave you stuck for quite abit (no worries thought, there is the hint feature that give you more hints overtime!)

Even after ""Finishing the game"" you could create your own fun by typing out various monsters/villians and heroes to pit them against each other and watch them brawl it out!

I originally played Scribblenauts way back on the Nintendo DS. I loved it back then, so I went and bought and played the new one on Steam. While it seems I have kinda outgrown these games, I do think there is still a lot to be had here as you are given freedom to do pretty much anything.

Wanna give a baby to a Cook, so he can use it as an ingredient for a sandwich he will feed to a kid in the park?? You can actually do that. Do you want to create a mutant Rainbow three-headed Pac-Man with x-ray vision and mounted planet destroyers on each head?.........well you would be high on mushrooms if you think you can do that, but someone could create such a mod on the Steam Workshop if they want.

So even if something doesn't exist in this game due to copyright, there is still a high chance you can just find it on the Workshop.

A really fun experience all around. As a middle school kid, this franchise was a great way to learn to think outside the box. This game does not disappoint. The central mechanic is to solve people's problems through Green Lantern-esque conjuration abilities. Whatever you can describe you can create.

The game is so open ended to the extent that it allows you to manipulate the world by simply modifying nouns with adjectives. In a restaurant and the table is too small? Click on it, and the word ""table"" will appear. Change that to ""big table"" and you have altered reality to suit your will as the table visually grows in size. The game gives a diverse range of challenges for players to explore and excersize their personalities through writing and gameplay. This is the closest I have ever seen a video game get to the personal expression of role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.

As an adult playing the game I started to notice a few issues, but take these with a grain of salt as I am not the intended audience.

For one thing, the gameplay begins to feel algorithmic at a certain point. The game is centered around creativity, but there are always easy answers. What can the lumberjack use on the tree? A saw. The fun comes in when you give a weird word to see if it works like ""beaver"" or ""extremely sharp pillow."" At a certain point however, through trial and error, you start to see how the objects the game offers are categorized, and what attributes the game is seeking with each question. At this point in the game is when the ragdoll cartoony style begins to become monotonous as the characters all perform the same actions and provide the same level of challenge.

If you are looking for my recommendation of this as a game or as a learning tool, it is absolutely well made and a joy to play. Scribblenauts nailed its central mechanic and provides a great avenue for players to stretch their use of it.

However, if you are a more savvy consumer looking for something like this game, but with less mundane challenges and more push towards the creatively absurd, I would recommend Scribblenauts DC over this. You interact with DC superheroes to use your powers with theirs.",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 2,1

Scribblenauts Unlimited is a classic puzzle video game that was released in 2012. Developed by 5th Cell and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, the game quickly became a favorite among gamers of all ages.

The premise of Scribblenauts Unlimited is simple yet innovative. Players control the main character, Maxwell, as he embarks on a quest to collect Starites and save his sister from an evil curse. What sets this game apart is its unique feature that allows players to summon almost any object or creature simply by typing its name into the game's interface.

This open-ended gameplay mechanic provides endless possibilities for solving puzzles and challenges throughout the game. Whether it's summoning a ladder to reach high places or creating a friendly dinosaur to scare away enemies, players are limited only by their imagination.

Furthermore, Scribblenauts Unlimited encourages creativity and critical thinking skills. Players must carefully consider which objects or creatures they need to solve each level's objectives effectively. This promotes problem-solving abilities and fosters out-of-the-box thinking.

The charming art style and catchy soundtrack add to the overall appeal of the game. The colorful visuals bring the imaginative world of Scribblenauts Unlimited to life, while the upbeat music keeps players engaged and motivated.

In conclusion, Scribblenauts Unlimited is a classic video game that offers an unparalleled level of creativity and problem-solving opportunities. Its unique gameplay mechanics combined with its charming aesthetics make it an enjoyable experience for gamers of all ages.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

For me, playing Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very entertaining way to touch and play a little with my inner child! For those who play it, everything seems like a simple logic problem that must be solved with a bunch of creativity. The fact the game has a simple and at the same time full of imaginative possibilities mechanic, which matches with the clean artwork and graphics, drives the player to this very wished psychological place of not worrying or not having to follow any kinds of protocols, by fullfiling complex and hard-to-understand objectives; but yet being driven and carried on by such direct and fundamental moral themes: making other people a little happier with the powers we have and struggling to undo an ""evil"" caused by our own acts. With the nowadays tendence of creating very human like heroes and villains, with a spectrum of mixed moral values and affections, Scribblenauts makes us all remeber a little what is like to have possibilities of believing and making things look and feel better without the need of titanic actions and moves.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Another favorite made by Behemoth. In its current state (Early Access update 3), it stands strong on an excellent foundation for what can be a masterpiece once finished. I'll list some pros and cons below for its current state.

PROS:

Artwork.
Voice acting.
Funny.
Turn-based made fun.
World exploration.
Co-op, both local and online!
Daily leader board with rewards (replay value).
World seems to have 'pick up or ignore' side quests.
Capturing new recruits to join your team is currently my favorite part.
The weapon and shield choices are great, and hilarious! Spatula for a sword, large piece of bacon for a shield, lol!

CONS:

Main storyline is limited to only one, really awesome btw, quest once the tutorial missions have been completed.
Sound track is VERY limited at this point, and music can get repetitive.
There needs to be about 20 more monster types added for capturing and battle variety.

CONCLUSION
Great game that's worth a buy already. Made by a team you can trust to see the project through to the end and finish with a great product. Highly recommended, worth it for the laughs alone.",Recommended,"2,058 people found this review helpful

Played as couple co-op. We found this game super fun at first, but the combat quickly becomes too repetitive and boring. Characters have next to no evolution from fight to fight so there is no progression aspect to reward the grind, and that makes doing all the game content kind of a chore after a while. Which is a shame because other than that, this game is absolutely hilarious. Really, really hilarious. Main quest and side quests alike. But yeah... too slow... too repetitive... and I usually never mind repetitive games.

I don't dislike this game but I'm 100% sure that I'd never play it again. This is more of a neutral thumb than a thumb down but well... Steam reviews system...",Not Recommended,170,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pit People is XCOM, Fire Emblem, and Pokemon thrown into the minds of Behemoth and what they made is a funny and good looking game. The meat of the game is doing battle with teams of bad guys with your very own squad that you find through the story mode until you find Sophia the Recruitador (a lot of characters in this game have funny names). Then, the game branches into another way of playing it. You can capture any unit you fight on the battlefield when you leave it as the last one alive. There are several character classes from the human fighters to the penguins to the beefy giants to the cupcake healer class. Every character has their own name from Gluten to Pipistrella.

This is an early access title as of January, and it shows only in the story mode. The rest of the game is polished and balanced with each weapon type and class, but the story mode is farly short. What it lacks in length it makes up in character and gameplay. The narrator Stamper was present in their previous game Battleblock Theater as well but he takes the role of a godlike bear that overlooks the story as a sort of meta-narrator, talking to the characters and talking to the player. Apart from the short story quests, there are a few side quests that are all five parts incrasing in difficulty. These serve the same purpose as side quests in different games, to give you some more gold and flesh out the characters. These side quests take a bit longer than the story.

Apart from the insanely fun singleplayer, there exists an in-universe multiplayer PvP called the Pit, which is pretty much the only reference to the title of the game. You and a partner control your squads to defeat two other people's squads. It's a very satisfying game mode as you can learn from the other people's squad composition to increase chances of success. Think XCOM PvP. You get story rewards as well depending on how many games you win per day. As it is now, Pit People is very fun and well balanced even though the story mode was short and as sweet as the cupcake healer class.",Recommended,220,6

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I grew up at the tail end of what I'll call ""the Newgrounds generation""-- that is, the adolescent boys (and, to a lesser degree, girls) who spent their youth on the website of Tom Fulp, engaging in the flash animations and games and becoming part of that underground internet subculture. I was always captivated by that which made Newgrounds, Newgrounds-- the fact that anyone could make anything and upload it, and anyone else could comment on it or rate it. And nothing stood out to my juvenille mind more than the works that made the website famous; the ultra-violent Madness Combat series; the absurdist humor of Eddsworld; the insane difficulty of early iterations of Super Meat Boy... The list of media that changed my budding self can go on and on. I retained all of it; I'll blame my entire personality and sense of humor on what I grew up watching and playing on my dad's old laptop. But the one export of Newgrounds that I always loved the absolute most was The Behemoth. I fell in love with their beat-em-up classic Castle Crashers at a Kid's Night Out party, as I played it on an Xbox 360 there. I was obsessed. Every waking moment I would think about, draw about, talk about the game. When I finally got my own Xbox 360, Castle Crashers was one of the first games I bought for it, back when you paid in Xbox points (where one dollar was equal to 80 or 160 points). I was a junkie for that game; I even brought my own Xbox to my friend's houses so we could play together locally. Years later, when I heard they made Battleblock Theatre, I bought it on the spot. It was everything I wished for-- The Behemoth's signature art style, sense of humor, and pefectly challenging gameplay, but on a platformer. I had a new drug, and I was hooked. I played that game whenever I could. Sadly, eventually, the burning passion I held in my youth died out. I would still play both games (Alien Homonid too, but to a lesser extent) from time to time, reminiscing on the bygone era of the post-Golden age of Newgrounds. Time passed, and I caught wind of a new Behemoth game from either Game Informer or PC Gamer in the magazine rack of a local supermarket. And this time, it was a turn-based RPG! I was amazed. I was excited. I spent as much time as I could researching it, trying to find out where, when, and how I could play it. That was years ago. Pit People was a cloudy fuzz of nostalgia and excitement in my mind until the day I opened up steam and what did I see on the front page-- Out now, Pit People. I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to get it. What stopped me? My own wallet. In my youth my pocket changed flowed freely, and I splurged on whatever I felt like-- games, DLC, food, movies-- but in my teenage years I was not the same. I decided to myself, ""ah, early access. I'll wait until it comes out for real"". 4 updates passed, and I couldn't hold back. I whipped out my debit card on the first day of the Summer Sale and proceeded to buy it. And I must say, it's everything I hoped for and so, so much more. Where do I begin? Everything is exactly as I remember The Behemoth. The gameplay is challenging, in just the right level of fun. There's tons of options for how you want to play the game. There are cosmetics galore. The story is humorous but engaging, light but oh so rich. The announcer is the same from Battleblock Theatre and I love it as I did back then. This is the kind of game I would have made for the young version of myself growing up at my dad's overheating computer playing on Internet Explorer until I accidentally discovered Firefox. I give this game a perfect 10. If anyone at The Behemoth is reading this post, I want to tell you: Keep up the great work. The Behemoth quite literally shaped my mind as a child and it's just as good as I remember it.",Recommended,545,8

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I haven’t seen very many qualitative reviews yet, so I’m attempting my own. This is based on what I’ve experienced in the game so far playing three hours on my Xbox One and on Steam altogether.

A turn-based strategy game, you can build a team of up to six characters with their own customized equipment. Everyone can have different weapons, some with effects and some that are strong against enemies wearing particular equipment. An example of this is that swords will be weak against people with helmets but maces will be strong against them. While customizing you character, you will see a bar graph which tells you their equip load, damage, range, defense, and dodge. Going above 100% equip load will reduce the character’s move points by one, and staying below 50% grants an additional move point. You can designate one person on your team as the hero. Doing so gives them more health, damage, and greater equip load.

The combat is fairly simple. Move your melee team members adjacent to enemies, and they will attack them. Ranged team members supposedly need at least one empty space between the enemy and themselves. If there are multiple enemies that can be targeted within the vicinity, that unit will seemingly choose a random enemy to strike. Some of the fights can take a few minutes depending on how fast your thinking is when it comes to moving your team.

Early in the game, you will find a city where you will be buying some of your items, fighting in the pit against A.I. or other people online for gold, and customizing your characters or changing your team members as you obtain equipment and people throughout the game. Gold and items can be obtained outside of this place, but you are limited to how many items you can carry. Two important items I’ve come across are campfires, which allow you to heal your team outside of combat, and recruit cages, which allows you to recruit enemies to join your team. Mind that you will need to unlock the recruit cages through meeting a certain character first. I would recommend not fighting in the pit early in the game against A.I.'s beyond story mode. Three consecutive rounds can be difficult to finish.

Story mode is not finished yet, but there are many battles across the map you travel through outside of combat. Alongside the story mode quests, there are other quests you can choose from. You can also encounter optional quests while exploring the map. The game will point you to the objective once you’ve accepted a quest.

The art and music are reminiscent of previous titles, but they feel updated as well. The narration is just as funny as it was in Battleblock Theater. Castle crasher players will recognize the combat style immediately. Battleblock Theater players will know how this game is loosely connected to it.

I've recently tried co-op. Pretty much the second person you play with will have the same stuff as you from the very beginning. When you unlock a character, they get a variation of them as well. They will also have the main characters in character selection when they have the chance to change team members.

I have not tried PvP yet, so I can’t say anything about them. Hopefully someone else can tell you guys about them. Other than that, that’s all I can tell you about the game. Hopefully you will find other qualitative reviews better than mines. If you buy the game, I hope you enjoy playing it as I did.",Recommended,101,2

Did you know that the term ""cupcake"" was a way to remember the amount of ingredients to make a cake. Each ingredient is measured by the cupful: 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs. This 1,2,3,4 recipe is why cupcakes were also once called number cakes.

Such a fun and fluid game, I was a fan of Behemoths previous games but to me this is the best one yet. Turn based strat games don't always appeal to me but here they have done away with a lot of the micromanagement whilst still retaining the depth and fun. Couple that with the ""recruit"" (basically kidnap your team members into slavery) mechanic, the mind boggling amount of team combinations, 2 player, The Pit where you can PvE or PvP and the ludicrous amount of loot and this is a no brainer.

First thing to note is that game being early access just means the story is not complete. Gameplay is finished, and there's a lot a of quests (which vary a lot) and stuff to do, including PvP mode, and extra difficulty. However, expect that after 2 hours, you'll have finished the story in it, which doesn't mean the game ends.

I loved the presentation of the game. classic Behemoth style, with a lot of humor, the same hilarious narrator from Battleblock Theater, and a lot personality behind it. Great music, with a lot of variety. For me, one of the selling points.

The gameplay is also great, however, is much simpler than your average turn based grid strategy game. Your characters attack on their own if they are on range of an enemy, for example. If you're looking for ""hardcore gameplay"", you might be disappointed with it. But I think that it goes in the right direction and it fits the game, while being very accesible for people not so into the genre. This is neat because the game has local and online co-op, so you can play this with a lot of people, not just hardcore turn based gamers.

Overall, i really liked the game. I would recommend it if you like the presentation, and you want to be playing it just to explore the world that the Behemoth people have created. If you're looking for a story driven campaign already finished, wait for the full release.",Recommended,60,2

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
From the creators of the amazing games that are Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theater, Pit People shares an iconic artstyle from Dan Paladin that has been gracing his games with for over a decade now. Despite this however, Pit People definitely holds its own from the rest of The Behemoth's titles. With countless amounts of unlockables this game will have a grasp on the completionists for a good while. Offering 18 or so unit types the team combinations are quite varied. It is unlikely you will see 2 team compositions back to back and even less likely that these team combinations will have the same gear. Strategy is up to the user and many troops have varying success rates depending on what their teammates are. Team synergy and positioning is the name of the game for Pit People and the game makes it quite obvious. Cupcakes can heal most units in the game but when it comes to the Electrobot unit type they cannot. The player learns that the Robots would do better in a team with Gnomes instead as the Gnomes can heal the Electrobots.

The game has countless hours of playtime. I played it in Xbox Game Preview and decided to get it on steam as well. Even as an Early Access title I would highly recommend this game. The main thing you don't have access to in early access is the complete story. You still get the first handful of missions but the final ones are not in it yet. You still have access to a large quantity of side quests and the online Pvp and Unfair challenge let you test yourself and recieve exclusive rewards for ranking high in the leaderboard among 99 other players. The game is great. The main things I hope for in a future update(s) is a that the story hopefully has more than just one more mission for the cutscenes are great. The game could standalone from its story without a problem, the story is just the icing on top. My biggest wish is hopefully after launch the game continues to update with new items (like a costume for the mascot that makes it look like the Raccoon from Battleblock if that can't become a new unit) and I cross my fingers for a potential new unit. We already have a good handful to select from but I have been playing for a while on Game Preview and I have played around with the units a lot. One more unit would be an awesome surprise. The game is awesome and the devs are just as awesome. They listen to the community unlike many developers nowadays and make good changes in their games. Keep it up The Behemoth.",Recommended,62,3

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'm happy to add another positive review to the thousands of already existing ones. Let me explain why.

Pit People is a great game and yet another instant hit, like Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theater before it. It might seem like youtuber bait at first glance, with all the ""memes"" and (literaly) toilet humor, but it's got depth, it's got great customisation and it's got humor that is gonna appeal to all ages. The Behemoth team delivered again (might I mention, they are the only devs with multiple games that all have 95% on steam I know) and I'm looking forward to watching the game evolve and grow.

Now let's get started for the actual review. As you might have already noticed, the aesthetic is very similiar to the previous games. The similarities don't end there either. You will often encounter creatures from the previous games and all kind of other references. These apear mostly in a huge variety of costumes and already mentioned creatures.

So how is Pit People different? Well, almost everything else is new. The combat system is turn based, kind of simplistic but very well implemented. Each creature has its own (mostly passive) abilities and stats, which can further be modified by items and weapons. Latter stands mostly for humans. There are four different types of elemental damage (fire, explosion, poison and ice), but there are also helmets and shields, armor, dodge and many more mechanics, that make fighting interesting (hint - stay AWAY from the farting mushrooms).

Your base of operation is a town where you pick quests, equip items, fight in a pit or simply buy new items and fighters (there is no need for that really, as you frequently get them during wandering anyway). Once you set foot on the huge map, you encounter various groups of enemies, which you can avoid or fight. You can also pick up new quests on the fly, ranging from quite a selection. I've heard there are more than 100 avaliable.

Another big thing I've yet to mention - co-op. It's not 100% required in order to have fun, but it helps to have a partner. You both plan out your turn at the same time and due to much larger number of fighters, it can really get quite chaotic (which suits the theme of the game). However a thing that has been bothering is the camera, which is quite wonky during co-op battles, expecialy on larger maps. But hey, that's why early access exists.

The last thing I'd like to cover is the look, sound and narration. I've already stated the cartoonish look suits the game perfectly and I stand by it. Naration is done by Will Stamper, same old cynical guy you've had to put up with in Battleblock Theater. He does a fantastic job in being both annoying and funny at the same time, pestering your heroes and making smug remarks. The soundtrack is great as well and I haven't gotten bored by it even after 10 hours of play.

Conclusion
Would I recommend Pit People? You bet your ass I would. It might not be 100% finished, expecialy the main story is lacking at the moment and I hope more creatures get introduced during development. Still, the game is well worth its price and has made me chuckle many times (expecialy some of the names). It's just as silly as it is serious and the combination simply works. BIg thumbs up from me!

Truly an amazing game.
After being a huge fan of Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater, I was really excited when I heard they were releasing a new game.
Even though Pit People obviously has a very different style, it still has the same amazing art, music, and humor that you would expect of a game from The Behemoth.
It has an incredible amount of content, I've so far only gotten through 20% of the entire game. There's a lot to explore on the map and side quests, each with it's own hilarious characters and dialogue.
It's also a very fun and relaxing game to play with friends. Between doing co-op missions and PvP battles, there are a lot of ways to play together and have a blast.",Recommended,46,1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pit people is a really great game. The teams are varied and very customizable, and the strategy is easy to pick up/surprisingly complicated.

The main strategy (since targeting is random) relies on

1. Picking off their weak characters
2. Keeping your low hp characters in the center of formations where it is hard to target them.
The placement of ones units becomes increasingly complex when regarding for robots, mushrooms, and mortars, which promote certain spacing and clumping restrictions accordingly.

If you enjoy strategy games, and are very into PVP I can recommend this. However, because the PVE gets droll very fast, You should probably have a friend to play with before you buy if you don't like PVP.",Recommended,34 people found this review helpful 0,0

Pit People (previously named Game 4) is a very fun and funny strategy game. Normally i dont like Hex Grid games, but this one is too good. I love the Co-op campaign in this game so much.

Great mechanics, pretty graphics, i also like the customizations. I love the humor - classic Behemoth humor. Lots of loots and sidequests, and lots of content for an Early Access Game. Great game for completionist who wants to CATCH EM ALL.

Buy this game, NOW!

Pit People is an RPG with a turn based combat system. The story is completely ridiculous in a good way, filled with unusual creatures, wacky humour and jokey one-liners. You are Horatio, a simple blueberry farmer who the narrator tells us is the most boring person in the world, and you're on a quest to get revenge (I won't spoil why) on a huge bear who floats in space. Things only get stranger from there.

Battles are fun, but tactics are very simplistic, with the focus on making them flow quickly. Most characters only have one kind of attack, so you don’t have any interesting decisions to make about when to use a special ability. The only real control you have during a battle is the positioning of your squad of 6 characters on the hex grid. After you tell your people where to stand, they will decide which enemy to attack. You can influence this slightly by placing them next to a single enemy, denying them the choice. But as there are usually 6+ enemies in a battle, this isn’t always possible.

When they stand next to 2 or more enemies, they will often attack the “wrong” target, for example I saw so many times when they had a choice between an enemy on full health, and an enemy close to death, and they attacked the full health guy instead of taking the kill. Its not always possible to focus fire on what you consider to be the main threat, like a healer or a summoner. Trying to avoid friendly fire with AoE attacks, without precise control over the target area, is problematic.

You can recruit enemies and make them fight for you, by throwing a cage onto the last living enemy during a battle. There are a wide range of characters to choose from. Cupcakes heal allies by throwing their frosting, sacrificing a little of their own health. Vampires can grow wings to move further, and regain health after a successful attack. Pixies have a ranged AoE attack. Octoclops can confuse enemies, resulting in them attacking their friends. Choosing which characters are a good fit for your party is the most tactical thing you can do.

The narrator's voice acting is great and he has some funny, sarcastic lines. But no other character has proper voice acting, instead you hear a nonsensical “hurble burble blah”, which gets annoying after about an hour. Especially when you realise that they only have a couple of variations of their nonsense that they repeat constantly. The music is fantastic and I haven’t suffered from any bugs or crashes.

The main story is quite short, but there are lots of side quests scattered around the world map. After 26 hours I still haven’t done everything, which means a full price purchase is good value. The simple combat feels a bit repetitive after a while, but I was motivated to keep playing because I wanted to see what strange scenario I’d encounter next. In one side quest, a motivational speaker gives his students tips on how to be a better cannibal, while another is set in an arcade where the current champion kills new players before they can beat his high score.

Overall Pit People is a good game, worth checking out, but I just wish the developers had added more tactical depth to the combat to elevate it to being a great game.",Recommended,28,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pit People is great fun! A few things definately need to be worked on and tweaked, but hey - for an Early Access game from a well-trusted developer, this is looking real good.

Essentially, this plays like a modernized quirky version of Final Fantasy Tactics. Everything you want from a tactical turn-based party battle management game is pretty much here. Lots of collectibles, both functional and cosmetic. Definately has a good chunk of different kinds of units (the deep customization really helps here in making it feel even more extensive). The online play is off to a great start - they are doing it right.

One thing I'll say right up front is that I'm thoroughly confused about people complaining about the short 'main story line' right now. First off, that's the tutorial folks - there is more coming. Secondly, there are over 100 missions WITH storyline dialogue that will certainly take you over a dozen hours to complete. Thats a conservative estimate, too.



First off, the camera desperately needs work with local co-op. They already said they would fix this as a high priority, so fine. Secondly, while the map is , it sort of, well, lacks a strong flavor. I think it feels very flat, and simply uniformly dotted with either small buildings or landscape chunks. While the map artwork is good and that is set, I'd like to see a bit of TLC go into making the terrain feel better in general. I hear keyboard and mouse controls are abismal, so be warned (I didn't try them because of this warning). Lastly, I think the music is fantastic, although it is not very artistically cohesive. One minute it is high fantasy classical-esque, then it's western cowboy music, and yet another it is techno-ish. Don't get me wrong, it is all good, but sometimes this difference made me wonder about how it was all chosen and put together.

Another thing I'd like to mention is the difficulty. In five hours, I had never lost. Mind you, I didn't play on 'insane' difficulty, but still. I finished the 'main story', which is just a tutorial or prequal to the actual story (this version ends where it appears the real story begins). I finished 11 quests and a few other things. With only a few hours in, I'm going to chalk this up to early game build-up. Plus, I think online play will likely be a different story. I did play online, but only very briefly.

Lastly, I felt that single player mode felt much better than local co-op. Local co-op was fun, but the screen was almost too busy, and I felt there was even less strategy. It was like 'just send the units wherever they are next to an enemy' kind of thing. It worked, which is the questionable part.


+Fantastically addictive combat; everything is done really really right
+Although I didn't like or as much as everyone else (I felt they were shallow), this game has really hit the mark with the depth it brings, respectively
+Controller support is great
+Don't be fooled - there is a ton of content right now; yes the 'main story' (ie. tutorial) is less than 2 hours - I assure you this will change; further, there are over 100 side quests and some 1,300 collectibles (I could see 15-20 hours easy - as an estimate)
+There are various parts of this game to enjoy, and it smartly lets you choose - you can turn on AI to actually do all the battling for you, which is great if you just like the larger aspects of the game


-Difficulty is questionable - I can't seem to ever lose
-Local co-op is just too busy to be enjoyable; it hardly felt strategic, either
-While the music is great, there is no artistic cohesion; this may be fine, albeit weird
-Overall, I'd like it to feel like there is more strategy involved than what I've felt so far",Recommended,34 people found this review helpful 0,3

There are already some longer Negative reviews here which essentially echo how I feel about Pit People.

I bought in EA around a year ago and waited until launch to play.

It starts out with the charm offensive set to Ludicrous. The first hour or so contains some amazing animation and acting that rivals the best cartoons of today. Unfortately this outstanding presentation is paired with some of the shallowest and dullest combat I've encountered. It bored me to tears as each fight can last upwards of 10 minutes and it never really gets more complicated than your first battle. Other than some boss fights or quest mobs which may require you to break through a door or a wall, or face a swarm of spawning enemies, it's the same. You simply try to position your guys and click end turn and hope that the round goes well. You're bombarded with EXP gains and LVL UP fanfare in combat yet your heroes don't seem to develop or progress. They don't unlock interesting abilities as far as I'm aware, at least not in my time with the game. The map appears to be packed with interesting locations yet they remain useless window dressing. You gather a metric butt-tonne of loot from completing quests and fighting map mobs, and while it seems like there are many items, there aren't many different items other than the visual gag of it being a fence post or a lolly pop. There are plenty of entertaining cosmetics which have no effect and I believe you need to sacrifice valuable armor in order to wear them.

I was bored to death after around 5 hours. The combat is so shallow and directionless, and is presented in a frustratingly clunky manner making it confusing when shuffling around 6 heroes. An auto-battler is available in options allowing the cpu to take your turns for you. It seems more efficient to just allow the AI to do it's thing unless you need to take over to perform a specific activity such as capturing an enemy. You can enable or disable it whenever at will, so that's a good thing? It's the only reason I played more than two hours.

If there were a tonne more quests and a... I was gonna say a fleshed out combat system, but combat system would be better than this. I'm reminded of how Endless Legend played out it's manual battles, except there you could actually direct which unit to try to attack, and I still ended up automising them because of how shallow it felt.

Perhaps it's more enjoyable in co-op or pvp. I could see this working well on the Switch or on the sofa with a partner for some mindless banter. If they can vibe with the at-times crass humor, then I'd particularly recommend for players completely new or unfamiliar to gaming. But if you were hoping for an evenly weighted, hilarious strategy game, then Pit People feels like it's missing a leg.

Was it blown off in to space by a giant space bear? Possibly.

I have nothing but respect for those at the Behemoth, one of the first indie studios out there, from alien hominid on ps2 to castle crashers to battleblock theater, the effort they put into their games stands out not just in quality but personality. The lineage for the company is one worth reading about, and If you're familiar with Newgrounds, you probably know the long history there,but these guys have been at their unique blend of game-spices since I was a wee lad, and it was a bootstraps effort to put the dream in motion and it wound them here on release of a hilarious fourth incarnation of a game only they can make and would be a pity to miss. Unlike anything the Behemoth has done yet, the gameplay is layered, but easy to pick up, about as time consuming as you'd like it to be. The trailers speak for themselves, but the voicework from Stamper, the animation from Dan, the coding of a team that wrangles the madness together know what they are doing-if the early access tag has you 2spook'd. Cmon. It's the Behemoth, so for what I was anticipating, I was not at all let down. I say fifteen is a steal, and with all the art and animation and style and humor in here, you're not likely to find a game that has the kind of charm and wit with gameplay to match. Unique In short spurts or hours of competing for leaderboard rank, this hexa-brawly-turn-based strategy has more to offer than many out there of it's nature. As far as early access goes, this is tip top fare and well worth your $15.",Recommended,34 people found this review helpful 0,0

>> tl;dr:
Same old but very new fantastic Behemoth game, but missing something important that will hopefully come in the development process. 8.5/10

----
>> For ape creatures who read:
Although there are many, many things about this game that make it just as good as any other Behemoth-- given, better than most other games out there right now-- I'm going to start this review with my one main criticism that I hope the Devs were already considering, which is that:

The battle dynamics, although at first really fun and definitely well-thought through by the devs, feels like it lacks an extra important layer of depth to keep the replayability of the game and the challenge of the battles exciting. To better explain this, the depth of the game's battle strategy can be broken down into:

- Organize and modify your team at base [making a compatible party suitable to your playstyle].
- Strategically place your units on the field of battle for optimum damage, tank-ability and utility.
- [Sometimes] manage which enemies you target to save the last enemy to be recruited.

These two and a half only layers of the battle scenarios are strangely enough to keep you playing the game for a long time. But, I do admit, it eventually can become redundant, and maybe even boring. There are only so many combinations of your ""team set-up vs. enemy team set-up""s you can go through before it starts to become repetitive routine strategy.

What I can only hope for is that the Devs add in at least one sort of extra layer of depth to the battle-dynamic which they add in through the development process; A layer like:

- In-battle item use.
- Added character-type activatable or auto-activated abilities (ex: leap for archers, charge for cyclops, etc).
- Talent tree sort-of-thing for personalization of each character you own.
- Something more brilliant that only a Behemoth dev can come up with.

A layer that can take you out of your routine comfort in a battle to yell ""F***, I hate it when that f***er does that"" or ""F***, I love it when my little character dude does that"".

Anyway, despite that one main criticism, the game really does nail everything you can love about a Behemoth game and more: Comedy, re-playability, well-constructed world, killer music, the always loved animation style, the unpredictability of every story-quest. Other reviews capture the best parts of the game in more depth.

All in all, 8.5/10. I just think it needs that one bit of spice.",Recommended,28 people found this review helpful 0,2

Pit People is a strategy adventure game with turn-based combat brought to you by the developers who also made BattleBlock Theater and Castle Crashers.

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!

Pit People is a strategy adventure game with turn-based combat brought to you by the developers who also made BattleBlock Theater and Castle Crashers. Pit People is a different genre of game than their previous games, but the character style and sense of humour is consistent in Pit People as well.

You create a team to with up to 6 characters on it, and battle against the enemies in turn based combat until one team is defeated or your objective is accomplished. I’ve been playing mostly on normal difficulty. I always heal to full health before each encounter, and so far I haven’t found the fights too challenging. I tried a mission on the insane difficulty, and if it wasn’t for my characters leveling up (to restore them to full hp) mid-combat, I would have died for sure. You can bring more than one of the same character type at a time, but the cupcakes don’t heal other cupcakes. If all of your characters die, you lose some gold and maybe some items, but there is no perma-death, so the game is forgiving in that sense.

During your turn you lock in all of your moves at once before ending the turn. If you make a mistake with the move, you can always change it before you end your turn. You are given plenty of time to lock in your moves. The combat has some random factors, like dodging, crits, and most notably which target you actually hit. You have control over your team’s movement, but you have no say as to which target you will actually attack. For example: if you place a character in a hex that’s adjacent to multiple targets, your character can attack any of the available targets, and not necessarily the target you want. There is friendly fire with AE abilities, and you can accidentally heal enemies as well.

You journey out from town to explore, or complete missions by driving around the map in a nitro-boosted wagon...that poops. There are enemies everywhere, but it’s nice that you can easily avoid combat by stunning them and running past if you want to. It’s a lot better than having to flee combat, since fleeing makes all of your characters take damage, and drops your items on the ground.

You can play by yourself against the AI, or in two player co-op either online or locally. There is voice and text chat In co-op, so you can coordinate easier. Both you and your ally take your turns at the same time, and there are a lot more enemies to compensate for there being a second player. There is also an arena where you can battle against other players in 2v2 battles or compete for scores on the leaderboard against AI.

In almost every battle, you have the option to recruit the last remaining enemy by capturing them with a net and cage. I think it’s awesome that you can capture any enemy you come across, and that it never fails to capture. It’s also neat that you get to keep all of the equipment that they are wearing when you are recruit them. Sometimes I wish I could capture more than one enemy per battle though. There are different species that have special abilities, and other species that can be equipped with gear. There are no skill points to allocate, but the equipment let’s you customize each character.
















If you’re hoping for story, there isn’t much in the way of a story campaign just yet, but there are still plenty of quests to do. Playing against the AI as single player is fun, but it feels repetitive after a while. The co-op is enjoyable, but I wasn’t able to try the PvP since I got impatient waiting for it to pop. Overall, it’s a nicely polished turn-based strategy game that’s not too punishing, and it has an abundance of collectibles, and the sense of humour you would expect from a Behemoth title. I have no regrets with the purchase, and I look forward to more of the story being added.

As a big fan of BattleBlock Theater and Castle Crashers I was really looking forward to trying Pit People out. It’s quite amazing how they can make a game which shares a lot of the good things with the previous games even though its gameplay is completely different. You can definitely tell that it was made by The Behemoth when you see the art style, hear the music and experience the humor in Pit People.

I really like turn based games so being able to play one in co-op with another player was an amazing experience. The amount of story and conversations was absolutely satisfying. It was mostly something we could laugh about. No story heavy ""you must pay attention all the time"" kind of game. Those are better for single player games anyway.

The turn based combat is very special compared to other turn based games I have played before. Mostly because it’s a lot about your movement, rather than % chance to hit or miss. That makes the gameplay very simple and easy to learn, but at the same time getting really good takes some knowledge of units and practice.

I made a spoiler-free StingeReview video of Pit People and you can check it out here:

As a fan of turn-based-strategy and previous Behemoth games I cannot recommend this game. The story and dialogue are very Behemoth style; goofy and original, however the key problem to this game lies in the lack of depth in combat. All combat feels the same and repetitive. There are slight class advantages against one another, but not enough greatly affect each battle. It never feels like you are getting any better. There are different weapons and armor per class, but within each class seem cosmetic. All combat just boils down to the melee fighters clustered in a circle. It never feels I could be doing something different that greatly changes the battle. Perhaps given Behemoth’s style of gaming they were not going for a game with a lot of depth but just a simple battler, in any case not for me.",Not Recommended,247,6

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
* Do remember this is Early Access, and as such the value of this title as I review it. My review is based mostly upon the mechanics and what is here, rather than a story that has yet to unfold.

Behemoth once again delivers a class A experience with their one of a kind over the top humor. A robust and expansive world, a myriad of memorable characters, and enough loot to make your butt fall off. Pit People has a diverse and simplistic combat style accessible to players new to the strategy RPG format. Yet still it goes so much deeper than that to the true strategist. Offering near limitless customization this game allows for any playstyle. From people who like to hide behind ponies, to those who crave the boom boom, to those who simply love rainbows. Whether you are a tried and true fan of Behemoth and their past works, or a newcomer to the party, I do believe this is shaping up to be one of the best games of the coming year.

That being said, if you are looking strictly to play a large story filled with conquest, glory, and pain, Pit People may not be the title you want...YET. As it sits you will not run short of things to do, amongst them being PVP, Co-Op shenanigans, loot hunting, side quests, and dying with laughter. This is not a typical gotcha early access. What you get right now, without the story, is well beyond the price value. Behemoth made the right decision to let us get the jump start on such a sweet game.


Pros:

+ Excellent Voiceover
+ Wonderful and Diverse Art
+ A+++ Soundtrack
+ Fluid and Simple Combat
+ Deep Customization
+ Fantastic Price Point
+ Contains the Color Teal
+ Fantastic and Lag Free PVP Servers
+ Co-Op Couch Play (Bless you Behemoth for keeping the old ways alive.)
+ Early Access (This game is well and far beyond what I expected to get at day 1 early access.)
+ Flawless Controller Play

Cons (Most Likely To Disappear by Full Release) :

- Early Access (This is only a con because my body is ready for the whole thing.)
- Difficulty Curve for The Unsuspecting/New Player (A.I.'s beyond story mode is a CHALLENGE, PVP garnishes more experienced SRPG Players)
- Keyboard/Mouse Controls Need Refined
- Can't Buy The Soundtrack",Recommended,42 people found this review helpful 0,0

I'm into XCOM, Civ, and all of that nerdy goodness. I've been playing Pit People with a friend who is not, and we're enjoying Pit People enough that I'm pretty sure Pit People will act as her gateway into deeper TBS games.

The combat is tactical and challenging enough to be interesting to someone like me, even if it's a little on the light side, but the HP values are so high that you generally have time to respond to units in untenable positions and get them back to healers without them dying so long as you stay on top of things. This is all clear enough as to be obvious to someone with virtually no experience in this style of combat. Unit variety and different team synergies are great, with plenty for more experienced players to sink their teeth into.

The tutorialing is absolutely awful. The game seems unfinished in this regard. There's so many aspects of the game that're never explained, or explained poorly, leaving you to gradually realise how things work. This problem is compounded by poor wiki support. Normally when faced with this kind of confusion I'd hit the wiki, but in this case I was dissappointed. This didn't prevent us from enjoying the game, but expect to be confused for a long time.

The humour is very lol random, penguin of doom absurdism. It'll be a matter of taste. We loved it. When Yosef did that thing he did, we properly cracked up laughing. Some people will find this intolerable, and I doubt those people could enjoy the game. Look at the screenshots. If people firing hotdog bows and wearing celery helmets, penguins dressed as purple lions, doge hats and fish swords seems like it might be appealing, give it a go, but if this stuff turns you off then you're probably not going to be able to power through it, because this style of humour is a constant feature in the game. The game has tons of character.

For us, this was exactly the sort of chill co-op game we were looking for.",Recommended,22 people found this review helpful 0,0

A very good game, even in Early Access!
Funny and fun, here's some bullet points on why:
Extremely fun Co-op
Still incredibly fun Singleplayer



I've played this game both single- and multiplayer and have beaten the main story that has been released up to the time of this review. After 28 hours of playing, I still have yet to find and beat all of the Side-Quests, which is pretty incredible since the quality of these are very high.

Some of the enemies are inherently less fun to fight than others most of the time though.",Recommended,27,0

This is one of the best if not the best co op games I have ever played.

Me and my friend had so much fun with this.

Something that is really worth mentioning is that every side quest has a story, every side quest battle has something unique. The devs have made sure they care about every single aspect of the game to make it as clean as possible. I rather take a game that feels this perfect that lasts 40 hours (or like 45 I guess since we had a few once left). Then a game with hundreds of hours into fetch quests.

Only downside would be that pvp is kinda meh and that some characters don´t really seem to fill a function.

If you wanna get a TBS game with endless humor, Pit People is for you.

I've forever been a groupie of Behemoth, savoring their humor that drops from the sky like anvils in a Looney Tunes episode, all while dressed in their over-the-top, crayon-colored antics. It's like they harnessed the power of absurdity and crammed it into their games. Some strange power prevented me from playing their next games. However, my desire was built up over the years, until the time has come for Pit People. So I told myself, “Well, I don’t wanna play a long game, lets pick it up and everything will be fine”. Oh boy I was wrong... Too much content as you can see from my playtime.

Well, the main story is shorter than a cat's attention span, but the side-quests, oh yes, the side-quests. There are more of them than you can shake a stick at – over 100. Each is filled with hilariously absurd tales turning your brain upside down. But the real gem is the main plot. What made me wet my pants are the boneheaded antics of the protagonists and everything about the antagonists, especially the narrator (the head honcho of bad guys). If Behemoth ever needs an extra narrator, they should totally give that guy a raise!

Ok let’s talk about the gameplay for Honey’s sake. This game is like a wacky, turn-based strategy cartoon where your team and the enemies are placed on hexagons (who needs squares, anyway?).


Your teammates are a motley crew, ranging from humans with all sorts of wacky weapon abilities to creatures you capture, like some Pokémon fever dream. Some of the abilities include stabbing, stunning, freezing (aka stunning but with ice), smacking enemies like baseballs, creating EXPLOSIONS, and a whole lot more.

There are endless combinations you can do with the crew. But you can’t just pick anything from your dirty sleeves and expect to conquer the world. Especially not in Insane mode. Oh boy, this one really made me sweaty. You'll need a balanced, versatile team to face every threat under the sun (or the hexagon, as it were).

Now that you're a pro at assembling your squad, let's dive into the missions themselves. Most of the time, the objective is simple: ""massacre them all."" But you'll also come across missions like ""protect those folks until X,"" ""get to the other side pronto while tangling with foes,"" and a never-ending list of craziness. The main missions are even more unique and you can tell the developers worked on them like they had a bone-shaped biscuit dangling in front of their noses.

I managed to snag 100% of the achievements, and let me tell you, the most challenging part was finding someone to play versus in the multiplayer. It is dead like the bear that crashed into our frail planet. However, if you find someone to play with (versus and even co-op) you will enjoy it even more than tackling Insane Mode.",Recommended,23,0
2989,49,Pit People®,"Posted: November 10, 2019
Pit people is a game I really want to recommend, but has a lot of major problems
that will keep it down.

To start off I was looking through common criticism of the game. and I found the most common 2 problems, is the game being repetitive, and the game not being very in depth, or having shallow gameplay. The reason people find this game so repetitive is because this game was designed so you will win with any strategy, and with any teamcomp in pve. even though this game has all the different units with all their different strengths and weaknesses, the average player has no real opportunity to explore this in pve, they can't really explore how in depth the game can be, with all the different strategies and teamcomps you can do. the pve both never ramps high enough if difficulty, or at least not often enough for the average player to come across it, and even the few times the game does get difficult enough, if they do have trouble with it, there best choice won't be counter pick units, it will be their highest level units. The game actually incentives using the same teamcomp because of the leveling system. your highest level units will outperform your lower level ones. so the game punishes you from trying something new. No ♥♥♥♥ everyone finds the game repetitive. The entire leveling system is just poor game design, and the way the game counters this is by making pve overall way easier than it needs to be, so you can get away with just about anything. so people will either mindlessly through stuff together, and just place everything in range to attack something. or they will stick with all their highest level units, and never explore other units. This is why people think the game is shallow and repetitive. either keep doing what works, and just do whatever because you can. insane mode is hardly more difficult and gives hardly any more loot, and that loot probably won't be what you are looking for, so there isn't really a point in ever turning it on. and permadeath mode is just grindy. because you need to keep capturing new stuff.

this game really really shines in its pvp. pvp is the best place to try out the game mechanics, and strategies of this game. the fact that both teams will be the same level, and same slot worth of units. you can't just bring in whatever and have it work all the time, and you can't just go to your high levels when you struggle. it's about just actual teamcomp and positioning if you want to do well. However this game has almost no incentive to play pvp, and because pvp is so different the pve is unappealing to a lot of people. all you can get is some extra item drops that you can also get from unfair challenges. The leaderboard isn't an incentive because it just shows who plays the most pvp, or unfair challenge that day. also there is a huge barrier of entry of actually exploring the pvp of this game, because you have to play a ton of pve first, to get enough different units and items, to actually start exploring interesting teamcomps and strategies. and if you actually want to play some pvp, good luck finding anyone to play with, the pvp lobby is dead. once I had sat in the pvp lobby for 8 hours straight, 3 days back to back and found 0 people to play pvp with in that time, it is incredibly sad.

given what the pve system is, I think that the quests and missions are decently well done for what the game is, even though most of it still suffers from how repetitive the game inherently is. though lack any replayability. humor is subjective, it's not all good, but I think at least through most of the main story, and a decent amount of the side quests the humor lands(but definitely not all of it). but the side missions lack replayability, and the main story isn't worth playing through more than twice. The only incentive to redo missions/quests is if you want to capture all the items, but considering most items are just cosmetic, there are so many. it's not an incentive for most people. so outside of pvp the game doesn't have very much replayability, unless you really like capturing tinted units.
also the game just feels incomplete. it has unobtainable items, it has 3 empty music slots for the town music. a lot of the animations don't feel finished, like the ranged human melee attack. among other stuff. the game just isn't finished and the behemoth has made it seem like they don't care about adding anything to this game anymore, their most recent update. update 7, was also a horrible update. adding the worst quest in the game, along with some other bad quests. along with adding bear blood rain randomly causing random damage and movement, they made sure it didn't happen on any quests they didn't want it to, but they decided to let it happen in pvp. making it so pvp matches can be decided by something completely out of the players control. along with 2 new cyclops weapons, thousand shards, and the storm stick, which are way better than anything else in pvp, and now what's left of this games pvp community calls them cancer sticks. and makes us wonder if the devs ever bothered play testing.

even though pvp is the best part of the game, it isn't perfect. excluding cancer sticks, pvp still isn't terribly well balanced, once you play extensively you will see some team comps are just clearly way better than others. a lot of items and units are completely outclassed by other stuff in pvp. units you choose as leader is the least balanced thing in the game, you have no reason to hero anything other than mushrooms cupcakes, and occasionally humans. Rainbow horses are unhealthy for pvp, they are literally just rng units, it makes it so rng can determine the outcome of the match pretty much no matter what. yes the game is inherently heavily rng, but unicorns take it to too much of a degree where it's almost a coin flip as to who wins if there is one in play. and gnomes are almost entirely useless in pvp, pvp has problems forsure on a competitive level.

There once was a time when I thought this game could come back, a time when I thought if just the behemoth added new update 8, that focused almost entirely on pvp. making the leaderboards better measure skill instead of play time, make pvp easier to get into, and make it more competitive. increase incentives to play pvp, I once though that would be enough to bring some life into the game, but I feel this is no longer the case, update 7 stepped on what was left of a dying community. I know multiple competitive pvpers who leave this game, and will never return because of how bad that update was, this game was objectively better pre update 7. Early access also killed this game, most of what this game has to offer existed during early access. The height of the community existed during early access, it started dropping before the game came out, and never picked up since, and at this point never will, as much as I want it too. I wasn't even able to play back then either, as I had a mac, I figured this game would be out on mac by the time of its official release, it wasn't not, and still isn't out on mac or linux. so there is another potential player base gone, keeping this game's numbers even lower. The behemoth has for the most part moved on from this game development wise. to work on alien hominid invasions, so we aren't getting anything new anytime soon anyways, if ever.

So would I recommend this game? I really really want to say yes, even with the problems the pvp has, there are still hours upon hours of fun to be had in pvp. I myself have well more than 2000 hours in pvp alone, and that was all well after the majority of this game's community has left, but I know the community has only died further since then. realistically, it is impossible for you to get anything out of pvp anymore with how dead it is. so if I'm to be in good faith I can only really recommend this game for its pve. which all it really has going for it's kinda funny story mode, and a few decent side quests, and that's is it.",Not Recommended,29 people found this review helpful 6,12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pit people is a turn-based tactical pokemonesque rpg about positioning and throwing people into the dungeon gathering volunteers to fight for you. There's hundreds of items to collect and missions to do. Almost every unit you see can be captured and put to death the test against people or AI. I personally prefer fighting other people, as of now I have about 1,500 victories in pvp. Although you don't gain experience when fighting players, you do get rewards and more points than you would in the unfair arena if you're working towards gold rankings. If fighting isn't your style, you can always spectate a battle and get rich by watching battles between players. You may even find me in there destroying someones team.

It's like Pokemon but there is a narrator and your character(s) actually talks. The game has lots of contents, just enough that I don't skip dialogues. The quest bank is huge, and it accompanies the campaign well (I think). Regarding the campaign, there is zero idea of what will happen next since everything is ridiculously stupid which makes it fun. The Behemoth, again, doesn't disappoint at all with the narration. The babbling voices of main characters is also a big plus accompanying this.
Big con is that the fighter choices is rather limited, and there is no mixed-traits for fighters (humans are versatile, but cannot teleport, for example. Not that I know of...). The price is rather okay-ish, since it's higher than average for these kinds of games if you only want to spend maximum 20 hours. If you reply the game from time to time (since it takes very long to clear ALL the quest), the price is worth it.

Main story line can be completed in under 18 hours(Even faster if you don't want to have fun) while also doing some other quests. Doing only main quests finishes the game quickly but the story itself is told nonsensically which is the norm for Behemoth games and I liked it. There is a New Game+ if you decide to also complete the monsters and quests

Though this is in the same universe as battleblock and Castle Crashers it doesnt continue their storyline at all(bummer) but you can still get their cosmetics as freebies for owning and supporting them +

Gameplay is Hex Grid tactic\turn based RPG though it differs from most due ot the fact that you are unable to control which target you are able to hit UNLESS you position your characters correctly. It also relies hits on RNG than the others. Initially I thought that it was hard to play due to RNG but the game is mostly about postioning\ placement and not about levels.

Pros-
- Plot is full of laughter and fun times
- VA Will Stamper is is back from BBT!?!?!
- Mining friendly game. no issues at all or even FPS drops
- Auto mode is nice addition since there are scenarios where it is pretty much a sure win
- Free Cosmetics if you own previous BEHEMOTH games


Cons
- Story though complete lacks a bit of continuity
- Levels don't seem to do anything much. More health but it really does not seem to actually do anything
- Saving system can be better explained(I had to check HOW TO SAVE)
- Items feel a bit redundant due to stats being nearly the same with each other",Recommended,22,2

As a Behemoth fan (played Alien Hominid HD, Castle Crashers, Battleblock Teather and now this) I can say that this game has the same kind of effort and love all the other games got from the studio.

The soundtrack, style and narration are top-notch, and they heavily carry the game, and The Behemoth proves they can improve on the comedic style of their games. In my opinion, it's one of the better turn-based games of the 2010-2020 decade, and I finished this twice back in the Xbox One release.

However, the main complaint a lot of people had (and still have) is the fact that the game plays very differently from all the other Behemoth titles: this is the first one that is a turn-based strategy game. This is where the takes get spicy, because I acknowledge that turn-based strategy is not for everyone, and it will definitely filter a lot of people that are used to the other Behemoth titles.

If you are ok with turn-based strategy, do get this game, it's really fun and you can literally spend hundreds of hours on this. If you can't handle such gameplay, I'd recommend you to instead watch the story from YouTube, instead of comitting to the grind.",Recommended,21 people found this review helpful 0,0

Like what everyone else is saying, the gameplay does get repetitive. The way I look at it is this:

The positives:
Incredibly funny and engaging story with likable characters and ""laugh out loud"" moments
Fun world design with unique enemies
Gameplay can be intensely fun at times

Negatives:
With Pit People, there is no particular incentive to come back and play. The combat is the same no matter who you fight, and the only real variety in the weapons/combat mechanics is the random effects or the weapons' appearances.

My biggest issue is that the battles take ages to complete! If each encounter ended up being a fraction of the length that they end up being, I'd recommend this game in a heartbeat. It would mean I'd want to run up to the random enemies in the wild, and it would mean I'd want to do the side missions. Instead, I look at each encounter as a commitment that I have to deal with instead of a fun experience that I get to have. I wanted to love this game, seriously, but I can't bring myself to play it over other games I could be playing instead.

TL;DR: I'd recommend watching a sped-up walkthrough so you still get to experience the amazing story without committing hours to stretched-out gameplay that could've been a few minutes long.",Not Recommended,20,1

Simple at surface level but still my favorite turn-based RPG ever.

I don't play a lot of them, not a weeb so that narrows it all down pretty hard, but i grew up playing Tactics as a kid and I've dabbled in a few other weird ones like ""Eternal Eyes"", but they all seem to have pretty boring flaws.

Pit People is like a simplified turn-based-tactical (I'm gonna say tbt from now on, shush) fused with a collect-a-thon, with no arbitrary boundaries in team composition. Outside of the small percent of main-story content, you are free to create any team composition you desire.

You start with a predetermined story team and very quickly you're thrust out into the open world, no leveled zones or limitations, you can go wherever you want (barring story levels) and capture whatever units you want. No unit types are locked behind progression, so you can have literally anything you want before you pick up the story again after the tutorial. I started the story about 90 hours or so in.

The game gets pretty simple when you get a powerful team, regardless of whether or not you're going with a ""meta"" so it's suggested you turn on Insane Mode (in the capital city) pretty early on. It beefs up the encounters and adds far more enemies, so it's a good challenge. One of the biggest complaints I'd often see were people saying the game was braindead easy when running meta teams (Like two Troll Moms and a Unicorn) but every game comes with it's overpowered, boring builds. Pit People excels best when you stray as far from the meta as you can, building strange, niche support teams like 6 Zombies 1 Mascot, or 4 robots 2 gnomes.

NOTE ABOUT CO-OP: While I adore this game alone, it's substantially better with a friend. Co-Op play doubles your team size and therefore your enemy team sizes, letting you have 12 team slots to customize. This game has local co-op and local shares the same bank of units, so if you plug in a second controller you can play co-op by yourself and utilize a huge army of units. I rarely see people mention this and it adds so much to the game if you start to get bored!

Quick word on PvP: You're not going to have a great time looking for PvP games. Since the game launched, people almost exclusively use really boring meta builds, so if you want to PvP, do so with a friend and lay down some house rules.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Another classic Behemoth game. Like the others, Pit People is an amazing co-op game and can also be played singleplayer. Will Stamper from Battleblock Theater returns as the narrator in this game again. The game is full of Behemoth humor, along with delivering a nice challenge. The strategy behind the game is what makes it so interesting. You don't choose who your units attack, so if a unit is in range of multiple enemies it'll select which one to attack randomly. Some units are more effective, and weaker against others. This makes the positioning of your units are important and is what makes the game fun. There's a ton of different customization options for different types of helmets and weapons as well.

All in all, a great game. 10/10 - hard to pass up for $15.",Recommended,12 people found this review helpful 0,1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
In Pit People you are a farmer and also a father who has lost his home and son. As you continue on, you dive deeper into insanity as you massacre entire populations of towns. You witness as innocent people are kidnapped in front of your eyes while you can't help them. You capture people to kill more efficiently. You let them die but bring them back to life to have them suffer the fate of death again and again. You kill people just for the hat they have on their heads. The story told is dark and chilling, showing us the struggles of Horatio in this unique setting. Pit People is possibly one of the greatest horror games of all time and will remain my favorite.",Recommended,61,0

This is a very good turn based game, I honestly enjoyed the soundtrack and art style.
It's not for everyone, but if you find it in your wishlist and it's going on sale for 50% off, buy it. Behemoth makes ""Silly games"" as everyone else describes it, they're no just that but also fun. It's just plain o'l stupid lil fun, and we play games to have fun. Just a good game to play in general.

Me recommend 8/10

The combat may not be for everyone, and that's perfectly fine, this game is not a step down from Battle Block Theatre or Castle Crashers. It's just a different platformer with different combat mechanics. It's easy to learn, you can catch all the creatures and it's kind of a shame that they didn't add more than they've already added to the game. There are a lot of side-quests and they're fun too, but it kinda slows down afterwards.",Recommended,13,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pit people is a hilarious, turn based strategy game. It WILL have you laughing the whole damn time. What the game offers so far is a few hours of highly enjoyable gameplay co-op or solo.

I would recommend getting a friend to play with though. As far as the ""main"" story goes I completed it in less than 2 hours and that was with some messing around and exploring. There are tons of side quests though and the Pit where you can do 2v2's or face the AI. You will gain daily rewards for winning in the Pit.

The best part about Pit People is that it is genuinely funny and has the biggest ♥♥♥♥ of a narrator that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. The narrator is a giant bear that tries to ruin your characters lives in the funniest, worst kind of ways. Every third or so time you return to your city, the bear will pick it up and move it somewhere else. Which isn't all bad because it keeps things fresh, but the nerve of some people, am I right? Just know that he will be intervening and ""helping"" you out in any way he can.

PROS
Actual Humour
""Easy To Learn Hard To Master Combat""
Great Teambuilder
Co-op
Tons of Loot and Cosmetics to Collect
Great SoundTrack

CONS
Sort of Annoying Inventory Selection (I only used a mouse)
Took Me Around 2ish Hours to Complete the Main Story Quests (EARLY ACCESS)
RNG (not terrible xD)


Overall Pit People definitely isn't a finished product hence the EARLY ACCESS, but there are still hours of fun to be had and plenty of laughs to well....laugh. If you are wanting a great game and are willing to wait a little while for more content then I would suggest picking it up. If you are into solo gamplay and want a story driven experience, I would probably wait until a few more patches or the full release some time this year.",Recommended,17,0

This game is a hard one to review, whille i love the art and humor of behemoth, this game also has a lot of problems on it's core design, let's go on parts.

Story and side quests, honestly the saving grace of this game for me, some missions are boring but those are few, mostly of them have that humor from behemoth the we know and love.

The units, after about 1 hour gameplay or even less you probally have seen all that has to be seen about units, it get's even worse when you realize that running a team of full humans is better than mixing all of the already small roster of units.

loot doesn't get much better, you do have stuff that changes combat for an extent but also falls short since when you got one of those the rest are pure cosmetic so when you get a new sword ""oh a new sword that do the exact same amount of damage that the one i already have but it looks better, neat""

Exploration, gets repetitive real fast, after a while you just stop looking for stuff and head straight to quests.

NOW the combat, oh boy THE COMBAT, THE STRATEGY that this game lacks. I can't really even express how BORING combat is, it was fun for the frist 1 hour of gameplay with the narrator going nuts when you got multiple kills etc, but when you realize it's going to be like that all the time with no new mechanics being introduced as you progress the magic ends. it's so simple, there's no real strategy other than making sure your guys don't get in a position where they would have to chose targets, but at the same making sure that your opponent have to choose between two or more of your units. For those who don't know, you move your units but you can't choose who to attack, the unit does that.

Difficulty: there's basicly none, and that's why most ''hard'' missions are just a bunch of waves rushing at you, and this aggravates the gameplay since combat is already so simplist.

Final point, if you don't mind using the same units over and over again, the super casual aproach to an stratagy game, you will have a great time on the pit, otherwise avoid it.

Oh and yeah this game has online and local co-op so that's always a plus.",Not Recommended,45,0

The Behemoth is an amazing team. Every game they produce has a unique style, yet they intersect somehow.
If you liked Battleblock Theater, Castle Crashers, or even Alien Hominid you will feel rewarded for having enjoyed those games also.

Pit People is one of those games that looks like it was made with a $50.00 budget but still comes out better and more polished than AAA games. The sillyness in the dialogue or even just roaming around laughing at enemies costumes makes this game both addicting and entertaining.

CO-OP is smooth. Playing with your friends and making jokes seems to be the spirit of this game.
that being said, single player is still very engaging for those worried that the campaign would be too dry without co-op.

If you are new to Behemoth games, now is just as good of a time as any to jump right in to Pit People.",Recommended,17 people found this review helpful 0,0

Pit People is a good game. I really did enjoy everything about it when I first started playing it.

QUICK SUMMARY:
When it comes to the plot and the writing, the game is clearly not trying to take itself seriously. This is one of the strenghts of the game: It's silly and absurd, similar to that of Borderlands 2. The artstyle and the voice acting of the game, definately adds to the silly nature of the experience, and it skillfully made. The gameplay, while not perfect, is still polished and good.

IN DEPTH CRITICISM:

The game itself mostly consists of turn-based and positionally based combat wherein you recuit different types of warriors and races, and equip them with gear that you can also collect. All with their weaknesses and strenghts. The biggest criticism I have for the game, is honestly that some types units are just too weak while others are too strong, and that some weapons are just... straight upgrades. I do appreciate how most weapons are just sidegrades though, but in the long run you realise that having a lot of armor is USUALLY better than having higher attack. The gameplay style that annoys me the most is the team that has a lot of mortar humans, or unicorns, and they all sit in the back trying to attack your units. The most efficient way to counter this is usually to rush them down, but very often they will still end up killing one or two of your characters. The level-up mechanic is a welcome addition to the game as it makes it possible to beat, but it also makes many battles far too easy. One of the reasons why I think it has been implemented is that they sometimes swarm you with many more units than your own lineup can hold. Sometimes in the wild you may encounter teams that consist of 8 character slots, while you only have 6. If you didn't regain your health through the level-up mechanic many of these fights would be too difficult. I feel like there must be a sweet spot must be there in between.

The world map as a mechanic first got me really confused. I thought that it was randomly generated, as every couple of runs you did into the wild you got put into a completely new place. But as time went on I slowly understood that, the map is just switching between a couple of presets. This is completely fine but a new player has no way to understand this, if they're not paying enough attention. Chances are they are going to be more interested in the scenery, the art, quests, dodging the enemies rather than comparing the world map across several hours of gameplay. There is also a fog of war mechanic each time you get put into the map, which is also part of the confusion. If I have been in a location in a specific world map 10 times, why doesn't the game reflect it? Once we've been in a place it's a given that we should be able to see it more clearly, and enjoy how the game looks instead of looking at ugly gray clouds.

As for the story quests, I won't spoil anything. The final couple of quests, that were added in the full release, were also very good but in some ways they seemed rushed. Especially the cutscenes. If you compare the cutscenes early on in the game and the ones in the final quest, you would think you are playing a beta version of the game still. They clearly rushed things in order to finish it up for the official release date: Which is something I can understand, especially for an indie studio, so I am more forgiving than some people.

Multiplayer is great fun, you can co-op the story mode or play against random people online. The one thing missing in it though, is to see how many other people are online OR searching for a PVP opponent. I waited an hour several times only to find nobody else was searching. Maybe include a link to a steam group, or discord, so you can find someone to play against? Something that also isn't made clear either is wether or not your fighter's level matters at all in PVP.",Recommended,13,0

Overview
Pit People is a turn-based strategy that is full of crude and sarcastic humor. The battles have been rid of as much RNG as possible, while some is left in to balance the game. During the player’s journeys, they will come across a variety of people and creatures to recruit. It is so much fun to see a new creature that is able to be captured. I haven’t had as much assembling a team since Pokémon. The graphics are comprised of 2D, hand-drawn, art. The music is enjoyable, but the sound effects really shine. The story is constantly poking fun at itself in a sarcastic and crude way. The story is absurd, but is so crazy that it always left me wanting to find out more.


The game starts the player out in a turn-based battle, which is the most prevalent phase of gameplay. The player may move the members of their team into the range of enemies to attack. Unlike other turn-based strategies, if the player moves a character near multiple enemies, the game will decide which enemy to attack. This makes positioning an important mechanic that the player must constantly focus on so that they attack their targets efficiently. That is one form of RNG in the game. The other form is ranged unit attacks. Ranged units will attack a target within a certain range. Depending upon how far away they are from the target, ranged units will either miss or could hit anyone around the target, including an ally. Thankfully, if the player is playing strategically they can avoid most of the RNG. The main resource in one of these battles is hit points. Every attack takes away hit points from the target. Some attacks have elemental attributes attached to them which are batter against certain creatures.

Shortly after starting the game, the player will be given the ability to capture opponents. I was initially hesitant about this feature, as many games have tried the capturing mechanic and failed. To my surprise, I found myself enjoying the battle system quite a bit. The player buys cages at the gate before they leave the city. After beating most of an enemy team to a pulp, the player is allowed to use a unit with the ranged net ability to capture the last enemy. This consumes a cage. The player doesn’t own the creature yet, as the player may drop the cage if they flee from a battle and must be recollected. Once the player is near the city, they can deposit their loot. This includes any captured creatures.

The city is the game’s menu. In the city the player is able to listen to music tracks, play against their friends or strangers, turn on insane mode, shop at the market, and visit the house. The two areas the player will spend most time in are the house and the market. The market allows the player to buy new weapons, cosmetic hats, and expensive mercenary units. This location is meant to allow the player to offload some excess gold. The house allows the player to delve into the RPG equipment system and cosmetic creature customization.

Every human fighter is able to be customized with a ton of cosmetics and equipment lookouts. While humans don’t have any special abilities during the fights, their special ability is that they can equip a variety of weapons. These include rapiers, swords, huge swords, and mallets. Rapiers are a bit weak, but they attack twice. Swords attack once and deal moderate damage. Huge swords deal a ton of damage, but they make characters go over the weight limit which reduces every stat. Mallets deal extra damage to enemies with armor which are in the form of helmets. Helmets greatly reduce the damage taken by swords, but take are weak to mallets. The ranged weapons include guns, double axes, a short bow, a medium bow, and a long bow. The guns and double axes can attack when in melee range, unlike the bows. Small bows aren’t very powerful but shoot the six times. Bow shots decrease as the bow gets larger. Bows only shoot half of their shots if the character is moved on their turn. Weapons also have special abilities, while rare weapons have elemental and debuff effects. These rare weapons don’t do as much damage or lose some of the weapon’s base abilities. They can be helpful when completing quests that are against a specific enemy type.

After choosing a quest, a side quest, arranging the party, and buying items, the player is able to journey out into the overworld. While in the overworld, the player will see enemies running around. If the player runs into one then a turn-based battle starts. It is nice that they are avoidable. The player also has a cannon that will stun enemies so that they don’t move on the overworld. Coins can also be gained by small coin trails. The overworld also has short mini quests that aren’t long but are still provide some silly dialogue and great items. The player doesn’t have to journey alone!

The entire campaign can be played in multiplayer with another player. This is a daunting feature to include in a game. I’m quite impressed that the developer, “Team Behemoth”, was able to include it is well. The battles feel just as balanced as they do in single player. I never noticed any lag or had any desync problems. Loot is given to each player so there isn’t any arguing over items. It doesn’t feel tacked on at all and is so much fun. This is a great choice for two turn-based strategies fans looking for a game to play together.

Overall, this is a great game that is a perfect in coop. It gets rid of a ton of frustrating RNG and instead replaces it with strategy. It is masterfully crafted and didn’t get boring in the slightest. It can be enjoyed by causal players and hardcore strategists equally. It is an great game for any strategy game fans.


The story uses a ton of crude humor. While this usually becomes tiring after a while, “Pit People” combines its crudeness with sarcastic, self-aware humor that isn’t afraid to poke fun at its own absurdity. Very few games have made me laugh with their writing, but I’m happy to say that this game is one of the few.


The sound design is quite good. Every hit from the characters feels so satisfying and the weapons have recognizable sounds. This way it was easy to keep track of the action. Special abilities and elemental attacks also have their own sound effects. The music is enjoyable, but since the game requires strategy, I turned it off after six hours.


The graphics are awesome. They are 2d, hand-drawn, line art. The animation is smooth and the graphics are crisp. The cut scenes are fully animated and look amazing. I couldn’t wait to watch the next story cut scene to see what absurd graphic was going to appear on my screen next.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
If you're here reading my review you must be wondering if this game is worth buying or not. Well, I'll go ahead and let you sort out your own opinion and you can decide for yourself. PLEASE NOTE: This game is in Early Access, so don't let this review effect your views on the actual game when it comes out. Thanks!

Pros:

Great Team-Builder type game. If you love the type of game where it's critical to build your own team, this one is for you The units I've discovered thus far are as follows: Tank, short ranged but fast archers, long ranged but slow morters, healers, heavy hitter, DPS, and self-sufficient. All characters spare Healer and self-sufficent are interchangable. You may equip them with items varying from a rainbow.. bow to a chalk board with Einstine's ""E=MC2"". Though beware, as weight limits may prohibit you from reaching your characters full potential!

In the world, you may fight to get loot. Beware though! If you lose a fight or flee you may lose your items! You must make the difficult decision of staying outside and battling for more loot as you complete quests, or you can venture back home and attempt to drop off your loot. Very good system!

Wonderful balance. The game does a great job of making you feel challenged but not overwhelmed. Never before in this game have I desired to quit the game because a level was brutally unfair to me. It gives me a great challenge, even if playing with a friend, but if it gets too easy for you INSANE MODE is already implimented in the game and ready to use. Turning it on is as easy as completing the tutorial level.

The game becomes self-aware.. mostly. The game only makes you complete its lengthy tutorial once, and after that you can jump right into your 5 out of 6 starting group and play away the day. It also holds nice polishes as to changes in the HUB city. Incuding little changes you might see after completing a quest..

The characters and personalitys are diverse. Going into this I was scared that all of the characters might be static and comedy-esq where I know they only joke. While yes this game has an AMAZING sense of humor, it is very careful to pick and choose when to be full on comedy and when to dawn the garb of light hearted seriousness.

Many refrences. If you're a proud owner of BattleBlock or Castle Crashers like I am, you are rewarded with headwear for your characters that have.. actually pretty reasonable stats. Long live Hatty Hattington, The Tearful Warrior!

Cons:

The interface for equiping weapons and armor is... foreign to say the least. Things don't add up. There are three kinds of swords: Short, Medium, and Large (Forgive me if the names are wrong, but that's the jist). Good mechanic overall, but the swords vary in damage only slightly while other stats such as DODGE and DEF. may suffer or benefit greatly. I found myself unable to equip items that may have looked amazing, or that I got from the games Early Access finale. Worst of all is that the swords add to your weight, so I find myself using almost only the starting weapons since they have the most balance.

Leveling is broken. A big part of the appeal to this game was the Leveling system.. only to find out it does nothing. Amidst the wilds of the map you might discover a wild band of raiders you wish to attack. You kill one and a beam of purple erupts from your character while the letters, ""LVL UP!"" appear briefly. Is it noticable? No, the ATK, DEF, Ect buff is so small you'd have to level up quite a few times. I'm talking 20+ times, and leveling up does get progressively harder.

Armor eye appeal. There is said to be 1300+ items in the game to equip, and the majority look pretty cool. Be it a cup of joe to a Doge refrence. However... don't expect your people to look cool if you favor stats. As unbalanced as the items are currently, you are ALWAYS stuck with the default ""T-shirt"" so to speak. Cool helmet? Great. B.A. Sword? Even Better. I just hope those things look cool on your plain white shirt or furry black hair troll.


Overall:

This game is a wonderful game in my eyes, and I hate turn based combat spare Pokemon. It will take you on a few laughs and possibly make you wonder if Stamper's voice hurts after hearing his strange diologue where he occasionally yells. I feel this game is a wonderful addition to the Behemoth family and is on the forefront of breaking the bad trend of video game companies pumping out reskin sequels.

For only the price of 15$ I would reccomend this game if it had a few more fixes onto it. It has a nice touch to it and great replay value to those who enjoy playing with team building options.


What could be fixed/changed:

Wagon upgrades, something to spend the money you'll accumulate as you progress. Something that's not needed nessesaraly, but something that would make the journey more enjoyable if you could customize your ride with cool looking cannons or an alternate horse type.

Biome types. The game is very scattered and geographically makes utterly no sense. While yes, it is the Bear-apocalypse that doesn't mean the world should be as mixed as it is. I feel as if the map should have started with plains at least, expanding into a mountain zone to the west and a lake/island region to the east. Something to help pinpoint where the player is at. Something where the player could say: ""To get to the Desert, go North onto the flaming fields, once you've reached the volcano zone stop and head east towards the island region. Follow along this route North-east until the islands begin to clump together and you'll see the desert. Enjoy!""

Biome types. The characters are diverse in this game, but you take no advantage of it. Keep the little bandits in the fields, and the massive cyclopse men in the farther out areas so the player FEELs threatened. Am I saying exclude them from the lower levels? No, but I would suggest making them more frequent and powerful the farther they are from the current location of your Town is.

Town/HUB Movement. It's a good idea, but if you went off of the Biome type idea I mentioned previously you might see an oppertinuty. This town movement instills adventure out of your comfort zone, but having the biome types could help the player navigate the landscape and perhaps even feel a bit more comfortable dodging the raining bear blood on their next quest.

The Pit. Give the player the choice to ""Descend"" the pit. It would eliminate part of the feel of grinding enemies outside, but here's the twist. The pit only gives EXP and little gold. The real incentive is if you can make it to X floor then you get a reward. However, to make it a challenge for your team you have to get down to X floor in one go. Perhaps a checkpoint at every 5th, 20th, or 50th floor depending on difficulty of individual floors? This pit idea would make the overworld seem less comforting as you'd be spending less time there, and the game would seem bigger as there's another objective for the player to do.

ADD TORSO EQUIPMENT. I've already said this in my review, but PLEASE add this. My team looks really sad-sack. I know the game is in the apocalypse, but the fact they never change shirts shouldn't hold in that situation either..

Leveling. Perhaps if you got your character to say... LVL 100. There should be some kind of choice you can make. Here's what I think that choice should be. Getting to LVL 100 unlocks a quest where you BLAH BLAH BLAH you're left with the option to keep them at 100, split the 100 with the other team members on your team, or spend the levels on unlockables NOT NESSESARY TO THE GAME. Ex) Rare music disc's, unused Stamper audio, paints to re-color your items to make them match. Things a perfectionist, most people who reach 100 would be this, would crave.

I feel very torn over having to write this review. Between patches 1-5 and the final release patch, it almost feels like different people worked on the game, (i know that wasnt the case, just so we're clear) and the people who did the 2nd half of the game just tried to emulate the first half's work.

I'll explain why i get this feeling. The game starts with a witty sarcastic humourous narrrator, good interaction between him and the protagonist, and a sense that you need to take revenge, there are good cutscenes with voice acting and humor. But this doesnt last.

The story of the game ends up feeling very weak and unintersting, and has you doing a lot for seemingly no reason at all, like needing to retrieve an item for one of the characters, so that you can retrieve another item for that character, so that you can use that item to...spot jerkimeties taking a spa day while you fall from the location that you retrieved the 2nd item from. Literally thats it, the 2nd item that the game up until now had you searching for and working towards served one tiny purpose, and the spa could have been seen with the naked eye.

And at this point in the story there is this weird feeling that something is missing now, there seems to be no real humor in the game anymore, and the cinematics have no voice acting, or real animation in them at all anymore, and worst of all, the hilaious narrator who would make quips and jokes isnt there, and hasnt been for a while now.

Ok so, the item you got was basically pointless, but thats ok because now the story is going to move on in a meaningful way right? ehh..no so much. You now basically play hide and go seek with jerkimedies as you catch him and he just teleports away, you catch him, he teleports away, then you go to his main base to fight him. Why wouldnt you just go there to begin with??

So after that he decides to help you for (very very) weak plot reasons, (i dont want to spoil the whole plot of the game) then you're off, to fight THE FINAL BOSS YEAHH!!

SPOILERS AHEAD

Sorry, i just couldn't NOT address this. So the giant bear who crashed into the planet was apparently a good guy, until a character from battle block theatre blasted a laser into his lover, killing him/her, causing him to become an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And during this, a 5 word song is playing, saying ""it all makes sense now"" over and over. But it doesn't. IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE NOW. Seriously, you mean to tell me, that because a character that wasnt even seen in this game, did something to him, he decided to take revenge on a TOTALLY RANDOM BLUEBERRY FARMER?! Seriously, he kidnaps his son and makes it out like horatio is the ultimate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but he didnt do anything at all. He then...my god its so stupid...he then grabs the battle block theatre guy, who has a laser shining out of his head, and uses him to destroy EVERYTHING. THEN a horse floats by, and grants him one wish..... so horatio goes back to the past, saves pipestrella before her dad dies, saves the cupcake before he is taken prisoner and meets up with yosef and sofia at the town, then it cuts to the bear sad in space saying ""what about my dream"" before the horse floats into frame and it fades to black with the end on the screen.

There is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ closure in that, that isnt a resolution to anything, the bear would have still been terrorizing the world, and who knows what his wish would have been.

END SPOILERS

So without spoiling it, let me just tell you, there is no resolution to the plot, none of it made sense, the game lost all its comedic value after literally the first 30 minutes of the game and the ENTIRE story of the game probably takes less than 6 hours to COMPLETE.

So this means that the majority of the game will be spent doing terrible low effort missions and quests that are basically nothing but random map encounters with flavor text thrown in and called ""content"". There are a total of like 15 different monsters and characters you can control, which is far too little, and all the weapons and armor choices basically boil down to cosmetic choices, and leveling up characters is borderline pointless due to how low the stat gains are.

Overall i LIKED the game, but im super dissapointed with how it seemed to be handled, in the beginning of the game it was clear there was a lot of love and care being put into it, but it became super obvious the further into the story you got, that the less motivated and interested they were in the game, and just wanted to rush out the finished product and be done working on it, and the game as a whole suffered. The second half of the game feels soulless and basically just ""there"" for lack of a better term, the story makes little sense and a LOT of it serves no purpose and goes around in circles for no reason, all just to end up with no real conclusion, which is really unsatisfying.

This game had a ton of potential, but it was squandered. If they decide to add more content and continue the storyline further out, then fine, ill change this review accordingly, but as it stands, i would not reccomend this game, the story is far too short, there is too little variety in party members, the gameplay is slow and not very strategic, it isnt challenging, leveling characters feels pointless, as does getting gear aside from the cosmetic purposes, and literally 80% of the game's content are side missions, which are basically random encounters with a few lines of flavor text thrown in.

Another great game by the Behemoth. A very simplified, but fun, grid and turn based strategy game. Lots of flavor, though the narrator was a bit underutilized in this one. Incredible amount of unlockable equipment and most characters in the game are recruitable, which keeps things interesting. The only team based two player game of its type to my knowledge, which was a blast for local co-op. There are ... more quests (with minor, amusing story attached) than you'll want to work through given that there are only so many classes to mix and match, but there are new mechanics added to a surprisingly large number of stages to try to keep things fresh.

If you're in the market for some laughs and a truly outstanding soundtrack, Pit People is a winner. It's been a long time since I found a game so utterly charming...

...which is why it pains me to say that the gameplay is so thin and boring that I can't bring myself to play it anymore. I kept going for awhile in the hope that it would eventually ""open up"" into something more than running my guys into their guys until one side runs out of guys, but apparently that really is the whole game.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Disclaimer

To start off I would like to first highlight that despite having 17 hours in the game as of the time of writing this review, I have yet to experience some of the major aspects of this game.

A. These being first Co-op element of the game which typically increases the fun factor of most games by upwards of 100% and I feel in this games case would make for a far far far superior experience.

B. The pit, an arena in the games city hub area thingy that features arena battles against both npcs and AI with coop also being an option.

C. The ""hard core mode"" or whatever it is called, while less important as not many people will be hinging their purchase decision on an additional difficulty setting, it still bears mention.
(Okay not entirely true, I did switch it on at one point but there were loud noises, flashing light, smoke and fire... long story short I got scared an immediately turned it off again ;-;)




This game. Is. Bonkers.
I never expected in my life that I would be setting the personal objective to go out of my way in a video game in order to..

Get a prettier pair of leggings.. that are purely cosmetic.. for my spider lady.. so that they would match the style of my companion.. who rides on her back.. and is also a sentient cupcake.. that flings portions of its body into teammates mouths.. so that it can heal them.. while slowly killing itself in the process.

Now in case you aren’t sold quite yet, here are some more general pros in my opinion.

- It can be described as ""babies first strategy game"" and and a derogatory sense.
Even if you have never played a strategy game or plain suck at any of those that you have tried, rest assured that you will be able to perform competently in this game. Simple and Satisfying is the motto I use for the gameplay.

The system cannot be called shallow so easily given the wealth of weapon types, unit types, team combinations and hazards/status effects that all serve to enrich the base combat experience.

Additional likeable features of the game that come to mind include the games vast degree of customization items (well over 1000 individual items) that give little advantage over each other in reguards to stats.
Sure some might have certain resistances or attributes such etc.

However as a whole this does not subtract from the game experience, it helps avoid a balancing nightmare and constant player worrying ""are the stats good enough? Do I have anything optimal? Omg heavens forbid I am not min/maxing to the fullest extent"" ad infimum.""

Instead this lets the player simply... have fun! New hat? Like the hat? Stick that sucker on!
Fashion souls to your hearts content, better to kick butt in style am I right! ^-^

A final attractive feature I will mention before moving along to the next portion of this review is the games full co-op (both local and online) functionality. Worked seamlessly into the game, for example;








Combat can get very repetitive and once you capture all the creatures you want, unless you spot an over world mob with an item you want, you may find yourself in the same position as me.
Actively avoiding combat outside of quests and even if you get sucked into one... just fleeing because scccreeww that.

This however is not a con within the context of said quests, this being due to the simple fact that a lot of tender love and care is put into quests. The maps which these encounters take place in are typically hand crafted and narrated, not only adding charm and character to both the enemies and the environment but also changing the gameplay.

Through adding in map objectives (camps to destroy, buttons to press, key targets, etc.) you can complete the mission without having to actually kill everything in the level!

My favourite example of this is during a mission where most of the gimmick is to throw tons more foes at you than you initially expected.
This still works. Why? The way the enemies are introduced is entertaining and each new enemy adds a new map objective making it easier beat the level beyond brute forcing i.t


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another issue with the game to some might be the early access status of the game, however with Behemoth working on the game given their track record with past titles and the update work on this game over the years you can stand to feel a little less anxious.

The main storyline is still underdeveloped in the sense that there are only a handful of mission (albeit recently paced, narrated and designed with interesting cut scenes and objectives) that you can be done within a few hours easily.
This will however continue to be expanded over time and is more forgivable given both the quality level and the games vast array of side quests.

These aforementioned side quests will keep you running all over the world map always excited for the next to see how the stories unfold. For example (spoilers) One mission leads you to

A final note before we wrap up for the cons is… hard core strategy players...
This might not be the game for you, the game is quite simplistic compared to other strategy games due to features such as the fact that if you move a unit to a positon. Whereby it *can* target more than one opponent... you have no control over which foe it will actually attack so... soooo yeah, that might cheese your onions if you know what I mean.


The game is only going to get better with time and the price is said to be getting hiked up about five bucks or so whenever the game leaves early access. So all around I would say it is a fantastic monetary and time investment.",Recommended,14,0

This would be the first Behemoth game that I can't recommend. The game itself is beautiful, wacky, and has the usual Behemoth humor, but the combat simply feels too slow. The fact that Pit People has an auto-resolve feature (Auto Combat) is a telling sign, and even that does not completely resolve the issue with combat pacing. Every fight is a chore and they always last twice as long as they needed to.

It's a shame because I've followed this game from the early access, but there's not enough bite in the game to compensate the combat.",Not Recommended,29,0

This is a decent game but it has a major flaw: You must have a minimum of an hour and a half to complete just one mission and you cannot save the game after starting a mission. You must return to town to save your game progress and if you do before completing the mission, you are penalized by having your town location randomized on the map.

There REALLY should be a better way to save the game, as it makes playing the game impossible for me. I usually only have about two hours each night where I can play and at any moment it can be interrupted by a 30 minute break to deal with a crying baby. On several occasions we had to call it quits very close to the end of a mission which meant completely abandoning our progress AND occurring a penalty for the trouble. On top of that annoyance, a mission can randomly be longer or shorter than average due to story elements. So you might think you have enough time to run a 90 minute mission only to find this mission takes 120-150 minutes!

Otherwise, I find the game cute and fun. There are interesting elements to the combat and the dialogue is constantly silly. You never quite know what to expect from the game except silliness. One other minor annoyance is the fact that there seems to be only one song. I don't know if I just haven't unlocked more tracks but I'm stuck listening to the same electro swing hit every time I play. I love electro swing but that song may be forever burned into my brain.

Ultimately I would recommend against the game due to the poor save setup. However, if you've got more free time and less obligations than I do, check the game out.",Not Recommended,26,3

What an absolutely fantastic game, Behemonth never disappoints that's for sure.
If you got a boyfriend,girlfriend or just a good friend in general to hang with, getting this game is one of the best choices you can do.

The humor as per usual to Behemonth's standards is spot on and always brings a smile,chuckle or a full on laught.
The gameplay is very simple but a lot of fun, probably one of the simplest turn based tactics game i ever played yet oddly still engaging. Granted, some fights in some quests i find tend to drag on for a bit too long with both me and my boyfriend thinking out loud at times ""Really, even more guys ?"" still, it's a minor annoyance in a rather excelent game, i hope it gets fully finished very soon.",Recommended,23 people found this review helpful 0,0

Pros:
-Nice art
-Funny Dialogue
-I wanna be friends with that bear
-A lot of side quests
-A lot of ways to customize the characters
-Interesting story

Cons:
-The story is so short
-The gameplay gets repetitive very quickly
-Even though side quests were a 'Pro', I wish over half of it was to make it fit in with the story instead.
-The different sections of the maps are a cool concept, but too small. There should be some special monsters to each kind of section that has unique gameplay to them. [If they decide to keep expanding]
-A lot of weapons were pointless and nothing more than cosmetic, wanted more variety in terms of stats.
-The leveling system doesn't feel rewarding at all but a chore.

This game is exceedingly good, and yet I don't see too many people playing it. It lives up to be pretty good, even in early access state. For one, you got some story time and the game seems pretty simple to go by. You got fighter types, weapons for them, customize them, and when they're in battle all you do is just point them where to go and they'll take it from there. It's got a nice turn-base feel, you got side quests and minor missions to do when the story isn't there, you can play with friends.

Best part? Stamper. Is. The. Bear/narrator thing.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For a game that's early access, it really doesn't feel like it. I'm going to highlight what I feel is wrong/needs to be improved, in hopes the devs see it and consider it. For a review, I'll keep it short. A very interesting world, full of LOTS of stuff, like LOTS, complete with music, great sound, and mostly good controls The music is amazing, I'll have it stuck in my head for days. Behemoth has yet another wonderful game out on the market. On to some gripes about the game.

The PC controls are mostly good, but could use some fine tuning to make them not so wonky when selecting loadouts, the default controls are questionable, but rebindable so that's not that big of a deal. Also, in the intro, the load out screen and differences between ""tiers"" of items (i.e. cosmetics, light helmets, heavy helmets) isn't at all explained. It was super super confusing because I had no clue what I was doing. So the tutorial could use some more fine tuning as well.

There are other things not very well explained, like what's on the HUD, I didn't know what I was looking at, or what it meant for a while. The items, such as campfires, and how to buy them isn't at all explained. I think my #1 glaring problem was the lack of explanation, so if you're reading this, Behemoth, it would be good to look into that.

These are the most notable issues I saw, but damn this game is freaking fun. Doing Coop is sooooo much fun, but online is a mess. The biggest thing this game could benefit from is more flushed out tutorials, really explaining what everythng is. Keep it up Behemoth, it's a damn good game.

If you can look past the shallow, slow combat, then you might enjoy Behemoth's unique humor, art, and world present in Pit People.

I could not. You control up to six characters, and the only thing you have control of in combat is movement. There is a good amount of unit types, but they normally only have one mechanic: a Cupcake which only heals but can't attack, a Cyclops that moves slowly that can sometimes throw enemies, and a good 17 other units with similar features. But it doesn't have a noticeable impact on how you play the game. You keep your tanks in the front-line, ranged in the back-line, and that's about it (generally). Environments don't have enough going on to keep it interesting in either its campaign or open world, so it's a lot of marching forward to the closest enemy. Fights go on for way too long as enemies have large health pools, requiring many turns of...moving your characters to the enemy to continue. Every party member has to slowly move into position and attack, which becomes unwieldy in large battles, so there's a lot of time spent doing near nothing in combat.

Progression doesn't exist. There are different weapon types, and tons of weapon models, but there's very little difference in their damage. One weapon might have a certain element attached to it, but that's about it. Armor's the same. You level up, but you don't get to customize a character's stats. Leveling up results in the character receiving full health and a 0.24% increase to their damage. Gear is the largest determinant to a character's stats.

The campaign is very short, consisting of eight quests that usually don't offer anything particularly unique. Characters receive little to no character development. While there's the distinct Behemoth humor and art present, it doesn't hold up well gameplay-wise.",Not Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 1,0

Wow... Just wow. What happened?

I'd like to start by saying I was an early access player. As someone who just now discovered this game you might think it's content filled, a fully finished game, and my hours playing it justifies how much game you can get out of it... Wrong. I erased my old early access review thinking it wouldn't be relevant anymore, but I couldn't be more wrong.

Not only was the development cycle of this game all over the place, so is the community.

To start, Pit People isn't a horrible game but it definitely isn't great. If you like turn based strategy or The Behemoth's typical humor you will most likely enjoy this game...at first. When stepping into Pit People you have this incredible feeling of exploration and a deep combat system with nearly infinite unlocks and collectables. However after a few hours the game is bare-boned and shallow as they come.

Firstly, the classes of characters in this game are not developed and balanced enough. They don't feel unique enough and when putting them in raw combat to compare they all pretty much play out the same. There really isn't a strategy aspect to the game as it stands and I don't think it ever will. Your party will almost always be able to take on 2 encounters before having to heal or return back to the hub. If you're great or if you're terrible it always takes about 2 battles to make you need to retreat. This game gets incredibly stale after your 10th battle; they're all the same despite what enemies are present and how many there are. It is very clear The Behemoth is doing trial and error on this one as they go. The strategy aspect of this game is absent.

Secondly, the map and it's exploration. This game has about 5-6 maps in which each time you load into a new world it picks a spawn point on one of those 6 maps. There's really no point to this aspect of the game. I was fine with it at first but after updates they removed the beacon back to the city. This makes trying to get back more annoying than difficult because time stops when you stop to open the map and try to guess where you are... funnily enough, they were basically forced to revert this in the release. There is now a marker pointing to the city at all times. Over the updates there was also a feature to make elite enemies stun immune, more aggressive, and inescapable. This is incredibly annoying because now special enemies on the world map just attack you out of nowhere and there's no way to stop them beyond out-driving them. I'm not too sure, but I'm fairly sure they got rid of this too. The same missions spawn in all the same places each time there's really no point. They could have just gone with a really big static map and it wouldn't have changed anything...

Lastly the collectables. This aspect is just rushed. They had their artists pump in as many crazy things as they could but they're almost entirely cosmetic. The weapons in this game used to be all the same and they tried to change that by making some unique. As time went on, they did this more and more with wider differences. Now, a lot of these weapons are beyond useless and simply cant be used in a strategic sense. There's no easy way to get these collectables or direct means of getting them. If you could just pay for a random item in a gambling machine it would be fine. Currently, the only way to obtain items is catching an enemy (kill all the enemies first, and have a character with a net catch it) and by random loot drops from doing missions/beating enemies.

Everything about this game just screams placeholder and subject to change on a balance level. The Behemoth was taking their sweet time with the game. (months between updates) Despite these huge time gaps between content they aren't changing much. The gameplay didn't get anymore engaging, the main story didn't progress (They delayed the release for cinematics of which, are still-shot sketches, nothing like the first cutscenes), and most of each update was just more collectable dumps. The core of this game never changed. It's still the same casual flat ""strategy game"" through and through. After countless rebalances of how levels and stats work the game is still exactly the same as the first build, worse really. In the final release they ended up undoing a solid 40% of things they changed from the first build. I wanted to give this game a good review, I really did but it's clear these are permanent problems lingering over the game.

The icing on the disaster cake is the community. Right off the bat, it's dead. Most people try to be helpful but it's just a ghost town.

I have personal problems with this community day in and day out. Back in the day I used to be extremely active, I would help people with any questions or problems. I would boast about having the most completion because I loved the game and played it religiously. However the downfall of the community was The Behemoth and their connection to said community.

They moved over to discord and the forums here were getting more and more silent by the day. So they decided to make a community manager, a fellow player. I don't want to seem jealous, but they made this guy a manager out of no where for no reason and he isn't an employee. He simply embraced a meme and became the center of attention by making his profile themed after Pit People. Sure, this is fine at first but he really isn't helpful or active like I was. He was basically made community mod to be a jester to liven up the place. (That worked really well right...?)

Then I go onto the forums after being disappearing after many months and updates. I come looking for help to get 100% completion or as close as I could. What do we have...? No one. The forums are empty for the most part. I stumble across a group of select people trying to make a full list of everything in the game. Turns out, they're close buddies who won't help out unless it's to help themselves. They just want Steam forum fame on an empty game. So I continue my search...

I go to the Discord asking around there. I find someone who's willing to help. To my surprise they had more items than me despite me 100%'ing the game a few updates ago. What do they do? Oh yeah, they scam me. Turns out this guy is also buds with the small group of completionists. Wow, great community huh? He accused me of cheating for having the max number of items when I played this game a lot longer before there was more content but okay...

The community is ran by 3 people and it's pretty obvious who they are, they AREN'T the devs. They own all the big guides, respond to everything, are overly toxic, and they scam. These 3 should be banned. What kind of a weird shut-in do you have to be to claim a steam forum for yourself, get buddy-buddy with the devs, then pose as a community manager to glorify yourself...",Not Recommended,61,15

So I might be biased because I've always found The Behemoth's animation style to be amusing. Pit People is cartoony and violent like their other titles, and I thought it was pretty easy to get into. I've never been very good at strategy games but my brother insisted I play this with him. He told me it was like chess, and he's wrong and right. Turn based like chess but more movement and less rules. It's easier to maneuver your characters once you understand the strengths and weaknesses of the different classes. So far I really enjoy this for being a fast paced but simpler strategy style game.",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 0,0

I thought about buying this game for so so long. It always had good reviews. Finally decided to grab during the fall sale. Damn I had been missing out. The game in absolutely fantastic. it looks so simple... and it... kind of is. But there is actually a good amount of strategy and so much content to unlock. Capturing enemies and getting the squad you want. Then customising that squad with tons of crazy ♥♥♥♥. There is lots to do from the main story to side quests and daily arena challenges with fabulous prizes! Pit People has all the humour of a South Park game but set in a post apocalyptic fantasy world where most everything is crazy and they will fight you for that pizza they don't give a ♥♥♥♥. The main story is a hoot (as far as I've got) and the characters ridiculous. It also has multiplayer/coop I've been wanting to play but haven't yet.",Recommended,13,0

Hi friends,

This is the only game thats inspiried me to actually write a review. If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy Tatics you'll love this game. Although this is still early access the game is very much complete although some of the story is missing. Not only is it hilarious but the game is very fullfilling to play.

The reason I've already played 24+ hours of this game is because of the pit. The Pit is a place you can use the characters you've developed to fight other people in 1v1 or 2v2. There are countless classes, weapons, armor and tatics on how you can win your next battle.

After each battle if you keep 1 person alive you can capture him/her/it and it will join your team. Any battle you encounter you can capture 1 of the enemies no matter how large they may be. You then can use its armor/weapons to put on your other characters or keep them whole.

I'd easily pay $50 for the game as it is right now. One of the best games i've played in a long time. If your on the fence, buy it, you won't regret it.

Much love and life!",Recommended,11,0

PROS:
Fun story.
Unique setting.
Nice artwork.
Great voice-acting.

CONS:
Tactical combat is very, very limited and repeditive.
Poor interface and controls makes unit selection and clarity a real chore.
Vast majority of battles are cakewalks that require no strategy.
Poor itemisation makes vast majority of loot useless.
Characters don't seem to get perceptively stronger no matter how much you level them up.
Very limited selection of quest types.


Hopefully everything about the combat and loot is going to get overhauled in a future patch, but until then I'd discorage buying this unless you're purely interested in the story and comedy elements.",Not Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 0,2

When Pit people first released, I would have recommended it in a heartbeat. Its funny, the mechanics (while simplified quite a lot compared to other strategy games) were fun in my book and still are, though some people might not like the spongeyness of all of the units, though i thought it worked in this games case as you were able to be a little more reckless than most strategy games. i loved the wide array of cosmetics and the vast amount of single player content, and my favorite part of all, the pvp. Pairing up with some random person and running troll moms or making a team of all cupcakes and mascots to buff your teammate into infinity was so satisfying.

So then why dont I recommend the game?

Well mainly it comes down to the fact that it gets old real fast, especially since multiplayer is essentially dead, as with most of the other behemoth games. The devs have consistantly updated the game with new content, but its almost always just more cosmetics, more ways to get money and cosmetics, and more quests to do so you can get cosmetics. The amount of unit types in the game are pretty small, and half of your team will be humans anyway since they are the most versitile of the units, so most of the others are made somewhat irrelevant. And i can kind of understand why they might not have wanted to do add more because of balancing things and the fact that adding new things to the world that arent mentioned at all before that would be kind of weird, but this isnt the type of game you play for immersion and i would rather see new units and mechanics and have them be shoehorned in without context in the game world than be stuck with such a small cast, because when your base mechanics are simplefied to the level that they are in this game, then its kind of important to at least have a lot of pieces to play around with to counteract that. You can only do so many different lineups and gimmicks with such a small cast before you are out of combinations to try out. And due to people running out of new fun combos to sick on each other, the pvp died out, and then once that was gone, going around collecting units and playing the single player just kinda felt pointless since now who are you going to show that new shaking colored name unit you got off to? Who are you going to pull dumb strategies off with and feel the satisfaction of beating a normal tried and true team or at least just have fun getting your ass handed to you with?

There is no community, there is nothing new and exciting, and there is simply nothing to come back to this game for. And i dont blame the developers because obviously they wanted to make a game that was focused on the single player aspect and that is fine. But its just sad to see that they didnt realize that that the best feature of their game, a feature that is literally the name of the game, THE PIT, the mutiplayer battle to death, was for the most part ignored.

And that is why i simply cannot recommend this game. I want to recommend it so badly but unfortunately it just isnt worth it unless it was on a heavy sale just for being able to go through the single player once for the humor.",Not Recommended,25,4

What could I say - I fall in Love. I feel unconditional, pure, raw Love for Pit People

This game was on my radar since fellow named TotalBiscuit made a first impression video on it from PAX. Since then I was patiently waiting for time to come so I could play another game from The Behemoth - studio so different with their vision, with exciting and ridiculous sense of humor.

Day of release has come, but I wasn't entirely sure to dip my toes into this fun loving, colourful water from get go, and I wanted to wait for full/finished product.
Everything changed when I watched video by another fellow named Jesse Cox. Him and gentleman I already mentioned few sentences before, started series together. Watching them play, and having fun encourage me to jump right in without any hesitation.

Oh boy! Oh boy! This game delivered.
Five hours in so far and I'm having so much fun. Too much fun. Insane amount of fun; and what I say now, might be a stretch, but I feel is fun loving cousin of and in terms of excitement that I have in me while playing.

Gameplay is just too damn addictive.
Writing and humor so ridiculously charming.
Possibilities with customisation are endless, same as number of different characters or creatures.
Music is absolutely awesome, I can't wait for official soundtrack to come out.
Visuals as always nice to look at, with many, many, many, many, many, many bits and pieces that makes the world feel vibrant and alive.
Everything this shows how much though was put into this game, and you can see it from start thru multiple playthroughs.

Besides unfinished story mode this game is polished to perfection ... well, I guess not perfection because inventory management bugs me quite a bit, more than I would like - but with this exception it is perfection in my eyes in terms of gaming experience.

Well done oh mighty . You guys delivered another instant classic.

I know, I know I'm just gushing no much saying praises, but it is just because I am filled with satisfaction and overwhelmed by how good this game actually is, and I need to get out of my system and spread it around.
If you liked previous efforts from this devs, I don't know what are you waiting for; don't be like me and just do it! - BUY IT!!!",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 0,0

The cutscenes and fluff are all very amusing and funny. I've laughed several times in my time with the game. Unfortunately, the gameplay becomes very tedious after only a brief period. The fights feel like they take too long and the lack of control on who you're targeting makes it impossible to really focus an enemy down.

If the fights had been a more quick and brutal affair it might have been worth a recommendation. Unfortunately, they stick around so long it makes the humor start to fall flat.

Hey yo -
I think it's obvious from get jump that this is a fun game. It's well animated, it has a silly plot, it has fun characters, overall it's a good time.
Is it for you?
Maybe.
If you've never played a tactics type of game before - I'll be the first to say, this is a good place to start. The game is pretty simple, and the combat flow is forgiving. It has elements of randomness to keep you on your toes. It has a lot of great music that never gets annoying witch matches perfectly with the fun character animations that make it a joy to play.
If you're a veteran of XCOM then this might feel a little light weight for you. You'll smoke this game and move on.
Are you trying to play with someone else?
I'm of two minds...
The coop was built in from the start, and It's not hard to see that it works pretty well, but I found that if you're playing for a campaign, I'd let this one go. The side missions, the silly world exploration and the character collecting and customizing are where the bulk of the fun is to be had in coop.

The campaign is designed for solo play. I made a video covering the coop campaign.

It's a good game. Maybe even great. Not amazing.

Vintage Behemoth style and charm. If you liked it before, you still will with this.

Turn-based strategy on a hex map that emphasizes positioning, thoughtful planning, and build creation. The game definitely has a theory crafting element to the build creation; this adds to the play time and enjoyment a lot.

Fun little overworld with decent replayability, but... it can get old.

Simple enough mechanics to not be intimidating, yet it contains adequate unlocks, depth, and complexity to last for quite a while imo. The diversity of unit types is pretty good and interesting. Ofc some are better than others, but each one has its purpose on the right team. The different types synergize well, and keep things interesting with the resistances, strengths, and powerful connections between certain unit types. For example, a classic powerful build is 2 x Kobold, 2 x Pixie, 2 x Vampiress. That is a synergized glass cannon, squishy but deadly sort of team setup. If you plan to get the game or already have it, try that out.

There is challenge to the single player, but it is rarely too burdensome. It is enough that you usually need to think and play strategically, but it won't destroy you mercilessly if you make errors. If a mission is destroying you, your team build itself is likely the main issue.

The party system and characters of different classes, that can use many different gear setups, have a simple, addictive charm. A bit reminiscent of Pokemon collecting/leveling/battling.

The autobattler is quite nice for afking, if you're into that sort of thing. It is certainly suboptimal to knowledgeable, active human play (as it should be), but the AI performs well enough to make it worth using. You can even manually add target priorities.

Co-op adds a lot of fun and strategy to the story/questing/overworld/arena combat.

Overall I would say 7.9/10",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,0

as Someone that has played a lot of Strategy Turn-based Combat games,
I can say Pit People® bring out a new casual and simple system to the genre..

If you just dive in into the genre and want something easy, casual and simple enough, this is a good start!
If you are tired of the usual crazy grinding with lots of complicated feature that usually accompany this kind of genre,
but Still want to play game of this genre? Just take this game, enjoy and relax a bit~

With this in mind, I do know and understand that some people feels the game gets repetitive pretty quick,
Tho, that is the nature of this genre..
Bear in mind that for me, I do not think its a ""boring"" repetitive kinda thing..
There's lots of little things to enjoy,
Some small tedious stuff can actually be fun if you know how to varies the way to do it~

Definitely a good game. Simplistic tactical RPG in a crazy and fun Behemoth's style. May be casual, yet may provide some challenge if you want some. Which will force you to form and use your squad more wisely, considering strengths and weaknesses of your fighters. And lots of equipment are mostly cosmetic, which is good as for me.

Also I enjoyed to complete quests. Some of them are pretty interesting, and most of them are very different.

Few things I don't like that very much

~ You can't save and take a break while not in town. Even in a single-player.
~ I really would like to see an option for battle animation speed
~ The screen when managing stuff, and people, and squads are not very comfy (especially with gamepad). Also, there is no way to see all your stuff. Only some part of it, and only when you select a certain slot on a certain fighter.

But still I hope things will become better with next updates. Cheers!",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

This game is in a world of its own. Normaly I would find turn based games horribly borring but the artstyle and the combat are so interesting. Even though it is in early access and the story isn't complete, there is more than enough content to be worth the price.

Great artstyle, great voice overs and packed with humor...
The developers of this game have 2 other games that are 'Overwhelmingly Positive' on Steam... and in my opinion, Pit People is another that deserves that title! It seems this developer CAN'T make a bad (or even mediocre) game.

Pit People is a tactical-turn-based, squad-management, open-world game. Right after finishing the prologue, you can travel ANYWHERE you want on the world map and fight anything and anyone that you want, which is a refreshing degree of freedom. The game is quite difficult if you don't understand the positioning of your squad on the battlefield, or the squad-management aspect of the game but you shouldn't feel bad if your squad gets destroyed... the game honestly has a nice degree of difficulty to it. Combat is 'slow', but it's a turn-based game so that can be expected... battles can sometimes take 10minutes+ for per fight, but time simply FLIES by because of the amazingly-upbeat music. The music is simply delightful and gives the whole game a whimsical feel (almost makes it feel like a cartoon). The dialogue of the characters is also quite funny and the 'voices' of the characters even more so... There's honestly nothing negative I can say about the game and for $15 it's WELL worth it, because you can easily get 50hours+ out of the game. The game is fantastic.

Duck Game is, quite possibly, one of the greatest games of all time.

The basis of Duck Game is simple: you spawn into the map at the same time as 1-3 of your close friends, and the lot of you proceed to look for weapons to murder each other with. Once everyone else is dead, you get a point. Once someone gets 10 points, they win the round.

It's a really easy game to pick up and play, yet the true entertainment in this game comes from the large variety of possible outcomes on each map. Depending on where players decide to go and which guns they like to use, each map can play out radically differently, resulting in new moments of hilarity in each gameplay session.

Just when the base game gets boring, you can then head to the Steam Workshop and download a quackload of mods that give you new maps, new weapons, and new hats. Ever wanted to fight to the death with Danny Devito's beautiful mug in the background? You can. Ever wanted to wield a lightsaber in your feathered fist? You can. With new mods still getting made every week, the possibilities are truly endless.

Duck Game is my go-to for laughing with friends and having a good time. I've already sunk nearly 70 hours into the game in the year or so I've owned it and I know it won't be long before I hit the 100 hour mark. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up, grab some friends, and quack it out together.",Recommended,270,2

For those of you with controllers:

Press B to quack.

Press Left Trigger to change the pitch of your quack; the more pressure you put on Left Trigger, the higher pitched your quack will be.

The more you know.



Duck Game is an awesome game where a group of up to 4 ducks are pitted amongst eachother with a plethora of unique weapons. Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being ""stay alive longer than your friends"". It almost reminds me of a competetive version of Super Crate Box (the gunplay feels similar).

I'll try to make this review as legitimate as possible without saying quack throughout the whole thing...

Overwiew
Duck Game is a 2D fast paced multiplayer shooter that faces up to four ducks in a head-to-head tournament to reach the score limit, which is achieved by winning each round.

Combat
Duck Game has combat that results in a fast paced round almost every time you play. It features one-hit weapons that will surely finish your opponents with ease, while also leaving you to play tactically so that you dont end up victim of those who face you.
There is a vast array of weaponry to take out your foes with, such as the devastating minigun, land mines, revolvers, and even bananas to make your opponents slip. Every weapon will kill you instantly if hit, unless you happen to find armor sprawled around the map.
One of the most talked about features in the game is the dedicated button for quaking, which is great for many things such as taunting your opponents or breaking the silence in an awkward situation. Another great feature is the ability to ragdoll your character, which when used at the right moment may lead others to believe you are dead, giving you an advantage or leaving you vulnerable to be picked up and possibly thrown off the map or into a trap.

Duck game is well worth it's price in my opinion. Playing with friends will lead to a great time, and quite possibly an ended friendship. Overall, the game is well done and it may be one of my favorite games of this year.

Serious review time.

Duck Game is a sidescrolling 2D free-for-all multiplayer platforming shooter. A fairly complex one at that, in fact complexity is the keyword here, it's what keeps the game fresh and at the same time somewhat inaccessible, more about that later.

Watching the trailer, it might seem like a complete clusterduck, and that's what it is, but it's an organized clusterduck, and it's genuinely fun. What I'm trying to say is that this isn't a gimmick game. It doesn't exist solely for youtubers to hit the quack button repeatedly (keep in mind quacking is still an integral and inseparable part of the experience). There is a reason to keep coming back to this game even after the novelty of hearing the same soundfile over and over wears off.

The crux of gameplay is that you are thrown into the fray with up to 3 opponents, last one standing wins. Generally you start off with no weapons at all and you have to race to obtain them before your opponents do. Most maps are built in such a way that you have either no or very weak weapons near your spawn location, with more powerful ones placed further away, hidden in bizarre places or even locked away.

When it comes to weapons themselves, as the trailer says, there is an irresponsible amount, and that's a big part of the complexity of the game. Each weapon works in a different way and to remain at least a bit competitive, you have to be able to properly use all of them, the whole irresponsible amount of them. Not talking about pro level duckgame MLG 1v1 ladder invite prem clan level, just to make it through the average casual match without dying first every single round which is barely any fun.

To elaborate on the weapons, they work in somewhat eccentric ways. For instance, you have to pump pump action shotguns after shooting them, and forgetting to do so can be fatal. You might find yourself successfully throwing a grenade to find out it's not going off for some reason, then have somebody pick it up, pull the pin, then throw it back at you. Reloading muskets, blunderbusses and bazookas is a very realistic process, and can't be cancelled, making you a sitting duck (pun very intended). Chainsaws are similarly realistic in how they can be thrown to land upside-down, leaking gas on the ground - subsequently sparking a fire with the blade is a possibility. Another quirk of chainsaws is that you can ""ride"" them by laying down, holding the blade in the desired direction of travel and revving it. Most guns have finite ammo much like Hotline Miami, and empty guns disappear after being dropped.

Swords however, swords work as expected. Swing it to kill a dude. Duck (hehehehe) to block. Throw with the throw key, thrown swords are just as lethal as expected. If somebody flying really fast lands at the tip of the blade, they get impaled, as expected.

Then there are some outright outlandish weapons that I've never seen in any other MP game, such as mind control gun that literally allows you to take control of the victim while the trigger is pulled, a net gun that shoots, well, nets, that trap your opponents, allowing you to pick them up and throw them into hazards, or the mooninite gun (consult Aqua Teen Hunger Force for details). Then there are weapons that seem outright useless at first, such as literal nerf guns and books, but everything can be lethal if the conditions are right.

All of above is just a fraction of the game's complex mechanics (not even going into said conditions when nerf guns are useful). It may all seem kind of gimmicky, but everything has a place in the game and it makes for a mostly balanced fun (mind control gun is as evil as it sounds though). The game does do a pretty good job explaining itself, though.

Some people prefer to jump straight into MP, as I did, and then finding everything very confusing, counter-intuitive and generally not fun. For those of us, there is the singleplayer component. ""Singleplayer component"" might be too strong a term, it really is just a tutorial/training mode. One that will take several hours to complete, not gonna lie. It does a pretty good job explaining the monumental amount of game mechanics, though. And yet, it still does omit a fair share that you discover by playing MP, but at least it does a good job easing you into the game and allowing you to actually enjoy it online the way it was meant to be played.

One thing that does a fairly good job helping you overcome the complexity is the control scheme. Putting this upfront - there's a negative review criticising the default control scheme and I have to absolutely agree, it's atrocious. I don't remember what it was before I turned it upside-down (pretty much the first thing I did in the game), but it had up arrow for jumping which confuses some people attempting to ride their chainsaws.

Other than the bindings, which can be easily changed, there are some measures taken to streamline complex interactions with the game. Other than basic movement keys (jump, duck, left, right), there are five vital functions: Grab/throw, use, strafe, limp and quack. Of these, you'll be mostly using the first two (and the last one). As complex and eccentric as the game is, the control scheme is very easy and doesn't stand in the way. However due to said eccentric nature of the game, certain basic actions require a lot of keystrokes - equipping a full set of armor and a sword requires you to rapidfire grab/use (with fast fingers, it will still take less than a second).

Once you get used to it, it's all about quick reflexes and making the most of your options - as you would expect out of a proper MP game. It's fast, it's complex, and the strategies being employed by skilled players can be mindboggling - one dude predicted three of us to run into a room with the flamethrower, so the clever bastard placed a box against the door from outside, preventing anyone to escape the fiery hell, including the guy who picked up the flamethrower (me). As we burned to death inside, he played a trumpet outside, next to a fire extinguisher.

After almost 1.5k hours of playing this game, I finally decided to give it a review.

This is the best game I have and it is the game I spend most of my spare time playing.

What is Duck Game?

Duck Game has and is everything that I want and look for in a game. It's funny, fun, challenging and has an extremely high skill cap.
At first glance, this game looks like a funny party game that would be a great hit amongst your friends. There is a dedicated quack button with several miscellaneous ""weapons"" that make the game extremely comical and there is a button that makes you ragdoll all across the map. To more skilled players, that ragdoll button actually has a function that is extremely helpful.

All in all, Duck Game is a game that you can play with your friends locally or online. There are several mods on the steam workshop that allow for some interesting gameplay and other mods that let you play with even more people (an 8 player mod for example). Duck Game offers some hilarious moments when you accidentally get caught in a net that conveniently falls onto an opponents head killing them, when everyone on the map is on fire and running around and more.

What are the pros and cons of Duck Game?
As with all games, there are pros and cons. The pros of this game far outweigh the cons in my opinion.
(I decided to start with the cons as there are fewer of them).



















In conclusion, Duck Game can be placed into the following categories:






I 10/10 recommend this game to anyone who is either looking for a challenge, or simply looking for an absurd amount of fun. Best game on steam in my opinion 10/10.


P.S. The fix for not seeing many games open? The Global-Matchmaking mod can solve that (if you don't mind a bit of lag).",Recommended,50 people found this review helpful 2,1

Frenetic and comical rounds in a multiplayer arena with ducks... wearing hats. You can choose your hat. If you're playing teams then you wear the same hat as your team mate. Hats are important.

Loads of different weapons and well designed arenas. Some battles, if you blink then you will miss them. It would be unusual for a fight to last longer than 30 seconds.

The biggest factor that makes Duck Game a success is the smoothness of the gameplay and the tightness of the controls. These mechanics are spot on.

Pros:
+A button dedicated to quacking!
+A game about ducks battling to the death, what more could you need?
+Many weapons to help you do said killing!
+Many maps to do said killing on!
+An offline arcade mode for those who want a challenge that isn't just killing other players!
+Hats, and plenty of them to wear while killing other ducks wearing hats of their own!
+Up to 4 players on the same system playing against each other if you want to!
+You can make your own levels to play!

so i saw a recent review and wanted to clear things up for some people since i am an expert in duck history

some people say its the great duck game war but that is false

This game is a metaphor for the early years of World War I

It tells the tale of how many countries (or ducks) went to war because they created alliances meant to keep them safe (which is ironic considering this was the most deadly war by this point). They sent out troops one after another to face certain death. Much like how you can respawn in duck game and are sent out into an arena like battlefield where only one of them can survive, honestly the mortality rate is HIGHER than that of world war one, where around 75% of the participants face a gruesome death at the hands of fellow ducks.

much like in World War one the ducks used any weapons available like flamethrowers and pistols and giga laser rifles from the planet xenon. these weapons often leave the victim completely disfigured just like in the real war, some weapons completely cook the victim turning them into a delicious thanksgiving meal, just like in the real war. often times the ducks will use any means available to end their lives, whether it be a grenade or just throwing a box up and breaking their neck.

and just like how the real war seemed it never ended, in an infinite stalemate killing eachother over and over, even when it seemed their was a victor another battle would begin making the victory very short lived. honestly, in my opinion from the evidence i have seen, i would much rather be in World War I than be a duck in duck game. The makers have really brought to life the horrors of war in a disturbing way. some ducks even pretend to be dead so the other bloodthirsty ducks would leave them alone. But then the ducks would just pick them up, and jump off the infinite void ending both of their lives, just like in the real war.


so yeah that was a quick history lesson and appreciation of the game makers impressive attention to detail.

Overall Rating - High Quality ★★★★☆

First Impressions
I saw quite a few videos on Duck Game (DG), and thought it looked like a hoot. After a while, the maps and situations started to blend together, so I had to wonder how long the entertainment value would last. When I played it with my friends, I was surprised by how fun it was, and how I had no issues playing match after match. I was more than satisfied with DG, and know it'll be a go-to game the next time they're over.


DG is basically a free-for-all death battle, with the first to reach ten points being the victor. After selecting the number of players and costumes, with a brief overview of the controls each time, you'll start loading random maps to fight in. You can change the options so that certain types of maps or weapons are chosen, but otherwise you'll play with the default settings. Each arena will have stage hazards such as spikes and bottomless pits, with at least one weapon available. These range from standard weapons like mines, muskets, and chainsaws, to the more fanciful like net guns, laser cannons, and holy scripture. Never underestimate the power of a charismatic speaker. One thought that comes to mind is that it'd be interesting if more than four people could play on a map at once, but maybe that'd be a feature they'd include in a sequel.

There's also has a single-player mode available, which plays out like small arcade games. They consist of challenges based on either platforming, or getting kills with a weapon, and you either have to beat the clock, or rack up a high kill count. They're all relatively short, but the difficulty in getting the best scores possible is rather high. Beating these challenges nets tickets you can spend to buy new game modes.


Per my preferences I played DG with a controller, and it works quite well. Certain items and weapons will control slightly differently, most of which you can learn more about in the single-player challenges. An interesting example is what the chainsaw is capable of. Another important mechanic is the ability to quack, which you have to do at least once upon winning a round. To not do so is Most important of all, you can press down to duck. Philosophically, I'd argue that by playing as a duck, by simply being, you're already ducking.


This would have to be inferred from the results screen and stadium of fans, but this seems to be a sports event, with viewers tuning in to see the performance you put on. Otherwise, there's no story.


This title was made using pixel, and looks pretty good. Environments have background features, such as the close-up view of Saturn, and the technological supports for the floating islands in the space arenas. The various costumes help make the different-colored ducks stand out from one another, though remembering who chose what can be hard at times. Since the screen isn't cluttered, it's easy to guess what role each object has. For instance, the clothing and armor are equipable, the key opens locked doors, barrels are flammable, and most weapons are easy to sum up just by looking at them. A few might do something unexpected, but they're easy to distinguish from one another once you know how they work.


Honestly, I paid no heed to the background music while either watching or playing DG. When I checked to see how it sounds, I found it enjoyable. The music is upbeat and catchy, though many of the songs are fairly short at around one minute each. With the various weapons in DG, they have appropriate SFX, like all the guns when they fire. Also, the sounds of quacking are on point.


🌟 DG is a good party game. You will see differences in skill level, but as long as people don't go try-hard, everyone can take it easy and enjoy a few rounds. The tone of the game doesn't lend itself to rage moments, though I suppose that depends on who plays it. I never got mad when I lost a round, or made a mistake.
🌟 There are a series of challenges to play in one player mode that allows you to unlock other options for the multiplayer modes. They're pretty difficult, but also serve as good practice.
🌟 There's good variety in the map layouts and weapon selection. This game has good longevity due to this, but it's hard to predict when the game might get stale for you.


❌ There's online play available, but the few times I checked, I wasn't able to find anyone to play with. If you try to use mods, this will disrupt the ability to find matches, but the game checks for this, and asks if you want to disable them to search for other games.
❌ Though you can play the game against only one opponent, rounds tend to be too short and lack the same level of interest that even one other player would provide. Plus, there are no bots available.


🔍 You'll want to learn how the different weapons function and how to properly use them. The single player challenges are a great place to learn about features that aren't inherently obvious, such as how the chainsaws can be ridden around like deadly motorbikes.
🔍 Don't get uptight over DG; just have fun with it.


DG is a very fun game that doesn't take itself too seriously. I suppose some party poopers could get tired of people flopping around while playing dead, victory quacks, and accidental suicides. However, if you have seen any of the videos on this game and enjoyed it, there's a solid chance you'd enjoy playing this title for yourself. Since you can play both online or locally, there are decent opportunities to enjoy the action. However, I tried finding online matches, but wasn't successful. So, you'd want to make sure you'd have people to play with, from either your friends list, or in person, as the single player challenges won't hold your attention very long. Not unless you really get hung up on mastering them. That aside, I highly recommend DG if you've got people to play with, as it's what it quacks up to be.",Recommended,36,3

A party game with the danger of addiction
!Handle with caution!

A friend of mine told me about this game about a year ago, when it first came out.
We tried it in school and after a few rounds others also showed interest. So they tried it too and just couldn't stop playing.
That's where the addiction started to grow.
It soon became a habit that, as soon as whether I came into the classroom and sat down or until I took my notebook out of my schoolbag, I got asked: ""Duck Game?""
You could already tell, that nearly every break was used for playing Duck Game.


But after a few months the premade maps got repetitive and we found out, that we could build our own.
Well ... damn.
So everyone, who was playing along, wanted to build his/her own map. :')

Then another few months later we encountered the opportunity to make our own custom duck hats.
... oh my gosh :P
Everyone wanted to have/make their own hat(s). :'')



It was a hard time for me as I soon had no time in the breaks (and also in some lessons!) to use my notebook for own purposes, like research, checking my mails or just social networks and surfing.
So I started to resist the requests what didn't work that well at the beginning, but I managed to put an end to the addiction of Duck Game in May/June 2016. Not an easy task to accomplish.

So that's my story about Duck Game.



Duck Game is a local/online multiplayer arena platformer for up to four players, featuring deathmatch, team deathmatch and single-player challenges, a map-editor and a variety of hats to be activated/discovered and mods to be purchased by in-game credits.
And this game was created by one man, Landon Podbielski.


There's a wide range of weapons in the game which are spread on the maps and you have to pick them up. But no map features every weapon (except you build your own map where you place every type) so you also have to be able to use any weapon in any situation. All projectiles from firearms and every single swing from a melee weapon are a one-hit-kill. The different types of weapons only differ from the range, the speed and the spread of the bullet(s)/edges. It features very fast paced movement, you're able to swim, glide, slide and pretend to be dead (ragdoll mode). And you can quack!


This game runs on 1080p at smooth 60fps and features a lovely retro-arcade pixel shading.
And all the assets, sprites, whatsoever are created by hand by Landon Podbielski, the one-man developer team behind Duck Game.


As already mentioned there are two ways to customize your Duck Game experience:

The mapeditor simply lets you build your own maps with all objects, weapons and decorations available.
You can also upload your maps to the Steam workshop.

And of course the possibility to create your very own hat. Therefore you'll need a software which allows you to draw pixels and export to PNG file like Photoshop or and the template from this site


If you have friends and want to challenge them but all the other games get old, get yourself a copy of Duck Game.
You can fight in deathmatch, teamdeathmatch or unfair (a team of three against one). Also there are no rules except the last survivor in a round gets +1 point, but you could also play where one with the least amount of points is the winner ;)
And if you don't have friends ... well the single-player challenges are cool?
No seriously, this is a multiplayer experience.



Overall a solid 85/100

Review by Sven Evil - Steam's best local 4-player curator! See 100s of more local 4-player reviews at my curator page!

You enjoy competitive platform combat games with your friends?

Then look no further and PLAY THIS GAME! It doesn't get much better in the genre. While the premise of the game is so simple that anyone understands it within a few seconds (grab weapon, kill other player(s)), the gameplay is rather varied. This is because of the 50+ different levels (from very small to rather big) and the 50+ completely different weapons.

From an old muzzleloader with one shot and very long reload times to a minigun with a recoil that throws you back a few meters to laser pistols you find all kinds of small arms. You also have swords (and armor to wear) or more exotic equipment like a mind control helmet to take control over your enemies (and direct them into the abyss, hehe) with a tin-foil hat as counter measure. And don't forget the land mines or the hand grenades. Or the flame-throwers to transform your enemies into a roasted duck! The multitude of weapons is what makes this game shine!

Your duck can jump, use weapons or equipment, play dead to deceive your enemies, and you can QUAK to annoy your friends.

Game works for 4-player local as well as online. XBox One or XBox 360 controllers work flawlessly.



One the same level of supreme quality than Towerfall: Ascension! Combat platform games don't get much better!",Recommended,35 people found this review helpful 0,0

Quack!

Duck Game is a side-on pixel art local and online multiplayer shooter where you can win by preaching to opponents. Duck Game has a vast arsenal of lethal and non-lethal weapons ranging from fire extinguishers to bazookas to suicide pistols, not to mention any guns you mod in. Duck Game has a variety of pre-built maps that are well designed and enjoyable to play and learn, there is also the ability to turn on random maps that are procedurally generated, but these can end up with unfair spawns and can get rather boring. There is also a singleplayer mode that is based around challenges using a certain mechanic from the game, these can be fun and frustrating but also sometimes a bit lacklustre and not a reason to buy the game. By completing these challenges you get points than can be used to unlock modifiers and hats from the shop. After a while the maps, hats and weapons in the game can get boring and lack the variety they originally had, this is where the workshop comes in. The workshop for this game is consistently active with new hats, weapons and maps being added daily so you can keep your game fresh every time you play. You can also add to the workshop by using the built-in map editor, it can be a bit fiddly but is overall OK.














Duck Game is a fun and fast paced action game that is great for a group of friends to play either on the couch or over the internet. It is very well made but can get boring after a while though it can be refreshed easily with the wide range of high quality and easy to access content on the workshop. It is only majorly let down by the singleplayer aspect of it and that isn't even too bad. Overall I would highly recommend Duck Game to you if you are looking for a game to play with 3 or 4 friends, but if your looking for a great singleplayer experience you won't find it here.",Recommended,26,0

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A CRITIQUE OR MEANT TO BE WELL WRITTEN/ENTERTAINING REVIEW, IT""S JUST ME EXPLAINING AND RECCOMENDING IT.

Duck Game is an Ouya game ported to Steam, published by Adultswim. It's a 4 player sideview 2d Deathmatch game. 2 vs 2 is also possible. Similar to towerfall, players die in one hit and then go to the next level when everyone is dead.

First when starting it up you'll notice the great sega genesis style soundtrack.
Second, you'll notice presenation is great. For example the main menu is navigated by actually walking to the options, and it is a nice looking menu.
When you start the game, you'll be thrown into a little waiting lobby that also explains the controls. You can change your profile here, and pick what hat you want to wear. You have to destroy the glass next to you to step into a beam and start floating in it. When you get into the beam you can either find a multiplayer game or play or, play the single player arcade missions. If another person is there, you can play locally instead.

The gameplay of Duck Game is simple. 4 people get thrown into a level, and in that level weapons and items are scattered throughout the map quake style, or hidden in blocks which you have to jump into like in Mario. The objective is ofcourse to kill eachother with these weapons. Everything is a one hit kill. When everyone is dead the person who survives gets a point and the next map loads. When 1 person has 10 points the game ends. The controls are simple. You move with the directional keys, and you have a jump and a shoot button. If you press down you can slide, which you can use to slide under small places. Unique to Duck Game is a dedicated button to pick the weapons up. When weapons or items are picked up, the player can throw them with the same button. These throwing physics are very well implemented. The movement speed is fast, and you're in pretty much full control of your jumps. If you jump and let go of the right or left button you'll almost immidiately fall. If you jump, and hold the jump button in mid air you'll slowly descent to the ground. There's also a feign death button, not sure what it's for but it's nice.
Oh, and there's a dedicated quack button, to, well, just make a quack sound.
The game is fast paced, chaotic fun. It's very easy to pick up and play. There's always funny moments to be had. People accidentally suiciding in the most stupid way right after winning and thus not awarded a point for example.


Most weapons are bullet based, and have a bit of a random spread. You also often can't see the ammo you have left. With some guns there's knockback, which gets higher when you crouch. They kind of work like incredibly fast projectiles, and the range varies. What you'll notice is that seemingly, you can only shoot sideways. On the surface it seems like Duck Game has no depth to it and is just casual fun. However, when playing for a while you'll notice there's quite a few things to get good at. First of all, many weapons have their own unique little quirks. A small thing is that many weapons require the button to be pressed again to for example eject shells before they can be shot again. You can mostly just shoot left and right, but aiming can actually be more skillfull then you think for a 2d game like this. You can walk through enemies, and when standing in an enemy the gun often can't hit that person, which happens a lot because of the fast movement. When you throw a weapon hard enough at your enemy, the enemy's weapon drops.
When you jump and hold down the jump button in mid air, not only will you slowly descent, but your weapon will point upwards, so you actually can shoot up. Not only can you do this, but you can actually shoot up diagonally. Since the gun doesn't point up immidiately, if hold the jump button and almost immidiately press the shoot button right after, you'll shoot diagonally.

The revolver has kickback, so if you keep shooting you can shoot diagonally with the recoil.
For the grenades you press the shoot button to take the pin off, and then you can throw it in any direction with the other button, and the physics (and the ease of killing yourself) of it make it a skillful weapon to use.
The grenade launcher not just arcs and then explodes on contact, but when you hold it down it goes up, so you can aim it. The longer you hold the button the more upward it aims.
The chainsaw has to be activated by pressing shoot twice, and after, you can do all kinds of crazy movements with it.
With the hammer you can also effect your movement but in a different way, and since it's heavy you can kill someone by dropping it.
There's an net gun that has a fast arcing projectile which traps your enemy, and then you can pick your enemy up and throw him out of the map.
There's a flamethrower and flame gun that can be extinguished by fire extinguishers, and the nerf gun ammunition catches on fire when shot at the flamethrower.
And there's more. 2 shotguns (with 1 you can see your ammo left on the gun itself), a few pistol's, a minigun, a sword you can also throw kill people with (and slash downwards in the air), lasers that bounce off of walls, a small laser gun you can charge up, a gun you can charge up for a HUGE laser, the mooninites gun from Aqua Teen Hunger force that shoots a really slow moving square and has a big knockback effect when shot, a magnet gun to push people off the map, a gun that turns people into you, a rocket launcher that destroys terrain, a sniper rifle, a rifle with a really long reload time, some thing powerful that I forgot, a flaregun, mines, an uzi type thing and an earthworm jim type gun, and a suicide gun. I think I got most of them. There's enough vereity in weapons to be had here, although I'd love there to be more interesting projectile weapons.

Aside from weapons, There's sometimes jetpacks and grappling hooks to find for movement, and there's body armor, a helmet and shoes(against spikes).

as far as the levels themselves go, you can pick up blocks in certain levels that you can use to drop on people's heads. There's other blocks you can use to block doors with. There's keys you can pick up to open certain doors with better weapons. There's hazards such as spikes. There's oil drums you can shoot to make all the oil come out. There's windows that can be broken open when pressing down or shooting on them. In a few levels there's teleporters you can actually shoot in and the nyour bullets come out of the other portal. What's cool is that there's a level editor, but an issue is that you can't play these online yet. Otherwise there's some crashes, and there's no game browser to speak of, only automatic matchmaking.

The singleplayer arcade missions are not that special, but they're a nice addition. Some of them are pretty fun. They're missions such as shoot as many targets as you can in a certain amount of time, or finish an obstacle course as quickly as possible, etc. You can either get a bronze, silver, golden or blue medal, and the better the medal the more tickets you get to spend on a few gameplay modifiers and hats.

Duck Game is not as competetive as something such as Towerfall but it does have a good skill ceiling, despite it at first glance seeming like it lacks depth. If you like games like Towerfall, Super Mario War and Samurai Gunn, be sure to give this one a try, especially since it has online multiplayer.",Recommended,31,2

Duck Game is great.

How great? That really depends on several factors. If I was comparing this with anything else, it would be asking if you like Super Smash Brothers. Super Smash Brothers, in my opinion is only 5/10 if you’re by yourself, but a solid 10/10 when you get a couple guys to play with. Duck Game fares similarly, being a competitive, 2D, PVP focused game with skill based platforming and reaction time. The difference is that Duck Game has the one hit kill intensity found in Samurai Gunn. The kicker is that you can’t attack if you don’t have a weapon, so the start of the match is just a rapid scrambling for firearms and panicked firing. It’s an intense, skill based shootout that I hope to be playing for the next 10 years at least.

Duck Game’s true greatness is its subtleties present in its design. At first it may seem constraining to not be able to aim in all directions like you would expect, but you eventually find that if you’re pressed up against an object your duck aims upward, still allowing you to fire. A particular gun that looks like a giant magnum recoils with each shot, letting you aim slightly higher to hit enemies, essentially you exploit a handling characteristic of the weapon into a game mechanic. The ducks can even float around on stubby wings and slide on their knees if you duck while running (ha ha), allowing you to do Matrix-like dodges against your enemies. Really great stuff, with a high skill ceiling but still easy enough to allow new players to get the drop on more experienced ones, which is the “sweet spot” I adore in competitive games. There’s a button completed dedicated to quacking (SERIOUSLY) which adds a layer of absurdity and humor to the already ridiculous setting that Duck Game takes place in.

One fear I have is the staying power of the online community. Too many indie games, have I bought on a super-sale only to see that the fan base has since moved on to other games. Duck Game is still relatively new as of 6/22/2015, so finding a game isn’t too difficult, but I really, really REALLY hope this game has longevity in the future. Like I said, 10 years please. One of the upsides this game has over Samurai Gunn is its near perfect online gameplay, which I hope keeps the game alive. I only had a couple of disconnects but the lag never really messed with me too bad. Even if the online dies out, with the local play, all it requires really is a couple of controllers and a few brewskies to have a great time. I love this game.

Duck game is hands down one of the best multiplayer games ever made. Best experience is made by playing with friends and starting to play at the same time. Duck game has an insanely high skill cap for a couch multiplayer game, where even though one button makes you go ""quack"", with enough play time you can learn to shoot diagonally, fly higher by shooting, master movement with the grappling hook, kill others with tactical table throws, fake your death and fight 1v1 for the win after the dust settles between others, and so much more.

However the game also delivers on the comedic side. Of course there's the quack button, but did you know you can close the eyes of a dead duck by crouching on top of them and pressing the shoot button?

Duck game is well made, funny, competitive, great with friends and just plain fun to play.

I just realized, bordering on too late, that I had never reviewed Duck Game.

This game is, unequivocally, the best couch competitive game I've ever played in my life. It's easy and fast enough for friends who aren't really great at gaming to continue playing even if they're getting destroyed by more skilled players, it's varied, it's so wildly ""pick-up-and-play"", you can hook it up and play a few rounds with barely any setup.

It's the only game that we love enough to have set up on a projector outside to play around a fire on some summer nights. We played it over the internet during covid, and countless hours between.

Now for the editorial part. WB Discovery is reportedly pulling this game among many others as part of their ever-increasing desire to make wonderful things disappear to see the line go up. It's unconscionable. Give the dev full rights to their game. It's too wonderful to make disappear.",Recommended,41 people found this review helpful 1,0

My favorite game by far. The mechanics are excellent. The combat is fast-paced and frantically fun. There are many great maps in both the base game and on the Steam workshop. The community is for the most part very respectful and tolerant regardless of skill.

In all honesty though this game is not for everyone. New players may have a rough time if they're joining random games. A skilled player can easily trounce newer players and it's tough to learn how to play when your opponents kill you in 2 seconds. The player count is down from Duck Game's heyday so sometimes it takes a few minutes to join a random matchup, but if you add players you enjoy fighting against you can get a match going at any time. If you have friends who'd be interested in playing, this is a must buy.

If you're willing to die a lot and can handle losing matches when you start out, Duck Game will reward with you the most satisfying gameplay in the genre. I've gotten more laughs and amazing moments out of Duck Game than anything I've played in my 25 years of gaming. My friends list is filled with over 180 ducks I've met over the 3 years I've been playing. I always find myself coming back to Duck Game because nothing else compares with the humor, intensity, and skillful gaming to be had here.

I fully and wholeheartedly recommend Duck Game. There's a reason so many players have hundreds or thousands of hours invested. It's amazingly fun, and enjoyably challenging. Also there's a dedicated button for quacking. Who could resist?

The best 2D multiplayer game you can buy on Steam. At first glance, it doesn't seem much different than any other game in the weirdly specific yet surprisingly well-populated genre of ""2d-4-player-one-hit-kill-battle-game"" but the incredible variety of weapons and level designs make it really stand out. You're never in the same situation twice. And on top of that, it has robust mod support via Steam Workshop.

All of this would make it among the best, but here's the major difference that rockets it above all other similar games: Duck Game has online play. Unlike Towerfall or Samurai Gunn, there's no need to get your friends in the same room or set up Parsec or go to other lengths. Duck Game's online play just works.

Also, it has a dedicated quack button - and a dedicated analogue trigger to modify the pitch of the quacking.",Recommended,19 people found this review helpful 0,0

Duck Game is a very special game. It's a game designed for everyone, but especially crafted for anyone who grew up in the Couch Multiplayer era, specifically Sega Genesis fans. It's a game with simple mechanics and an endless supply of frantic over the top fun.

The rules are simple, first to 10 match victories wins! Matches generally last about 10-30 seconds, after which the next one starts up almost immediately on a randomly selected map. The rhythm of the game is almost never broken up, keeping a quick and exciting pace throughout. There's an ungodly amount of weapons, each with their own variety and mechanics. You'll find everything from Derringers, to Shotguns, to Nerf Guns, to Mooninite Lasers!

Although the main draw of this game is easily the Multiplayer, the Single-Player challenges offer you a chance to train your skills through a series of modes. These challenges give you major insights into lesser known mechanics of the game, which can give you that little edge in combat. Through winning challenges you get Tickets, which you can spend not only to buy hats, but also GAMEPLAY MODIFIERS for multiplayer!

Did I mention there's a dedicated Quack Button? That can be pressed at any time. Seriously. It's the best thing ever.

This is like Warioware mixed with Worms and Smash Bros. Just crazy, zany fun that practically everyone will enjoy in some form or another.

Controls are a little funky and take a few rounds to get used to but once you do it's pretty great. The developers clearly put a lot of thought and time into making sure everything is fluid but also makes sense. Also the quack button.

A shooter platformer and a damn fine one at that!

Duck game is one of those games where you could say the Devs thought about everything.
If you grab some friends you can dive into the main game of fast paced deathmatches on a variety of maps with both gimmicks and balanced designs in mind. If you somehow get bored of those, you are covered by a very intuitive level editor as well as the steam workshop where you can get content ranging from maps to weapons, hats and stuff like that.

Locally and over the internet, it supports a wide number of controllers and it's really simple to set up games and customize to your liking in many ways.

Alone? Not a problem really, single player challenges and the level editor can keep you busy. The single player portion of the game can teach you a ton about the mechanics and also make you practice some skills that will be useful for multiplayer, you can even unlock cosmetics and mutators too.

Gameplay wise the game really shines on both it's vanilla map design and weapons, you are sometimes forced to be creative and even stylish with the way you use them and will always keep learning new mechanics and intricacies that can add some really satisfying depth to the combat.

In terms of movement nothing is ever wasted in this game. Ducks are nimble and control superbly. You can hold the jump button after a jump to flutter (Which also makes you aim diagonally and then up in just a few frames, keep that in mind :>) Ragdolling makes you gain some more momentum for those high jumps you thought impossible, you can slide while running to break windows as well as dodge bullets.
Pretty much every movement option in this game has at least a couple of uses that may not be apparent at first glance.

With a few exceptions, the weapons of Duck game will kill you in one shot and since the game is a platformer. Every player can see each other and when fights are not mayhem and explosions at break-neck speeds, they can turn into tense mind games and some amazing plays. Or comical accidents that will be rewarding anyway.

When you think of aesthetics Duck Game is impeccable with it's Genesis inspired soundtrack and clean pixel art which looks nice and is easy to understand even with the game's frantic pace, If i needed to describe the songs and atmosphere in a more subjctive way. I would say they feel like summers when you were young. They are some catchy tunes with a care-free attitude as well as adrenaline pumping songs that will accompany any situations with ease and really fit the personality and charm the game has.

Overall I think this game can be an amazing experience for anyone and even more so in groups, games don't take too long and never really get frustrating or boring, it can be addicting and is such a joy to pick up. It's just one of those timeless games that you will probably remember some years later and have fun the same way you did when you started.

I highly recommend this game and wish you all good luck and good hunting!",Recommended,24,0

quoth:
...
Allow me to approach you as first reminding you that this game is very surprising and deeper than you’d think. We’ve all experienced that.
I want to reply sentence by sentence.
“I never said it wasn’t viable in competitive just that it was one dimensional and frankly not that fun.”
“fankly not that fun”
I have fun playing this map. Others do too. Subjective interpretations of maps should not be criterion for what constitutes competitive play in Duck Game. I have fun playing every map, even ones that I also feel have no place in a competitive environment. Fun is not a factor in competitive demonstration of ability because of its subjectivity. I prefer to try to keep discussions regarding criteria for maps in competitive play to be focused on observations and analysis. When we let opinions get in the way of our thinking, our ability to consider outsider arguments is clouded. This is because we have a framework that is guiding our ability to reason instead of keeping a pure, open mind towards something.
“One dimensional”
The structure of the sentence quoted above causes this particular descriptor to become a negative remark regarding competitive play. Please explain why you feel this way instead of assuming it is universally agreed upon that lower dimensionality provides a worse competitive environment overall. Discussions with substance such as that help with discourse. I gave a loose opinion on 1-dimensionality while also backing up my opinion with reasonable arguments earlier. Using arguments based on reason and observation facilitates discussion.
“Part of the depth of Duck Game is the variety of skills that can be used to gain the upper hand in a fight.”
Does this not include skills such as movement, and positioning? These are part of that variety of skills. Why should any particular subset of the total set of skills play a role in our decision making in regards to competitive play? I’m not saying such a claim is absurd, but that you should provide more reason as to why you may feel such a way.
""For some players the core mechanics of Duck game that are so important in snow 11 pale in the comparison to angles, clipping, and other tech skills unusable on that map.”
This comes across as implying that those players who place importance on those other techniques have a greater weight in the discussion of what constitutes competitive maps than players who may not place such an importance. Just because you cannot use a particular set of techniques on a map does not indicate that the map in question is not suitable to competitive play.
If you truly outclass your opponent, you can show this with any dimensionality of skills. If I can win more than you can when we restrict our input environment, then I win in that environment. These skills also exist in environments with higher dimensionality. So, when we go to play in those dimensionalities that other maps contain, we bring with us any relevant crossover skills from maps such as this. Movement and positioning are not flashy and may not excite you like a wall shot. But they exist in every other map. And they are fundamental.
If we can give players maps that showcase these abilities, we can more accurately gauge the skill level of players in this game. We can see various subsets of skills without fuzziness being caused by the presence of other options and gameplay routes. We can then see if there’s a correlation between smaller subsets of skills to the total. What is important in order to win this game? What is good?
Questions like this can be made clearer with variety. You like a variety of skills, and so do I. And I like a variety of maps where this variety of skills varies. If every map had the same kinds of options as Office16 or Industrial4 or Level3, this game would not be as fun. Instead, we have maps that showcase different abilities. Forest11 and Level4 with nade launchers. Office 8 and Industrial05 with netguns. These maps have variety built into them. And no one is looking to get rid of any of these maps.
Snow11 is another kind of variety. It feels a little slower, and is a little less flashy. There are no(t many) angles. But it’s a map that showcases input precision and meta awareness. And to me, it is awesome. It lets me see opponents in specific lights and offers an environment to improve as a player. I love that kind of experience. And in comparison to other maps, it’s special. It has a role, just like nade launcher maps and netgun maps and “gun maps” like as Office07, Snow03, etc., and any other type of map that we can distinguish given the set of normals.
"" I feel that a lot of competitive players want the maps they play to not only be equipped for high level play like snow 11 but also to have variety and just be fun. It is after all why we play these games in the first place: To have fun.”
This map is equipped for high level game play, it does lend variety to the rotation, and it is fun.
The problem with reaching an agreement on this whole matter is that last descriptor. You might not have fun on this map, but I do. And even if you don’t, it has the other two elements you’re saying that competitive players are looking for.
When we strip maps out of the rotation of what is deemed competitive without justifying such a decision based on arguments regarding objective criteria such as the type of competitive environment a map is able to offer or the “variety” - subset - of skills able to be used on such a map, then we risk both creating a stale competitive environment at the whim of people’s opinions, as well as preventing ourselves from improving as a whole.
“That may be where your running into conflict about snow 11, I think people might be looking for an excuse not to play it simply because they don’t like it, and I don’t blame them.”
“look for an excuse”
Exactly. Subjectivity is the excuse. If you want to get better at Duck Game, you should welcome any environment that offers such an experience: Snow11 let’s you git gud. You might not feel that way, but it does. It gits you gud at things you can’t even see at lower levels.
Maniac, you have less than 700 hours. I have nearly 2000. I know how I felt when I had 700, and when I had 1k and when I had 1.2k and when I had 1.5k. I know what I felt at 80 hours, 230, 480. I have always loved this game for the same reason, it is fun and you can also git gud.
Trust me when I say that Snow11 can help you git gud. I have fun on this map partly because it’s a map that gits you gud. And if you find fun in gitting gud like I do then I think you’ll come to see this as a great map. And if we’re talking about taking a game seriously enough to call it competitive play, then should be the objective: gitting gud. If a map can be scrutinized objectively and argued for or against, then we know we are talking competitively.
That’s why I don’t want it banned from competitive play. It would strip so many players of a potentiality of objective improvement. It might feel weird and different to them, and this might be boring. But it’s not unfair, nor is it guaranteeably as slow as some other maps. I know that there is an untapped skill ceiling on this map and that we should explore it. I have strong feeling that the time this map will take to finish round by round will get much lower as time goes on.
I have a lot of fun exploring that kind of potentiality. It’s why I play so much and why I’m so good. This map can help you guys get better – I know this.
And I want you to get better! I want to feel like there’s someone better than me, again. I want to work towards pushing our limits beyond where we see ourselves. I have always wanted this. And I can tell when a map allows for this to be something we can do.
Snow11 is such a map.

Gosh, where to start with one of my all time favorite multiplayer games ever? It is the pure chaos of running towards the best gun, ducking and sliding across all the levels, a perfect grenade across the map, wearing shoes to smash the person below your feet, opening a present and shooting yourself in the face by accident thanks to the reverse pistol, the suspense of hurling the rock to the end zone during the intermission...

Duck Game is a very specific type of game. It doesn't go out of its way to be anything other than a perfect multiplayer game (the single player is amusing, occasionally fun, but unnecessary). It makes it difficult to review: this is a game you'll either spend twenty minutes in or two hundred hours. (Most of my time is logged in the PS4 version). Buy it, invite some friends, and have a blast.

Duck Game is the definitive party game for competitive friends. A simple fighting game where every weapon is a one-shot kill and your movement is more important than your aim, Duck Game is a party game for a new age of couch gamers. Those who grew up sweating for their lives playing Smash on 13"" CRT screens grew up into adults that needed to play something on the bigscreen with their like-minded friends - Duck Game fulfills that niche. Simultaneously casual-hilarity and competitive-sweatery, Duck Game is an absolute joke of a game that is easy to learn, difficult to master. The gameplay loop is painfully simple yet outrageously addictive. You will happily lose 45 rounds straight if it gives you the opportunity to dunk on your friends just once. The ability to collect hats and furniture pieces for your loading-screen bedroom is beyond fun and gives the game a ""reason to play"" as if dumpstering your friends with a rocket launcher while toxicly quaking wasn't fun in itself. If you have real human friends who are willing to meet you in person and share a couch with you, you must buy this game. It is limitless fun for a low, low price. The graphics are simple yet endearing, the music and sound effects are perfect for a straightforward party game, and the performance of the game is what you would expect for a 2D side-scrolling fighting game. It is fun to play, fun to watch - a perfect way to get a house party started.",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 0,0

Duck game, in its most raw and simplistic form, is a good game. Being a fast paced PVP game that you and your friends can play.
But there lies the problem.
Friends.
If you want to play this game to its full potential and have fun, play with people who don't have several hours more game time than you. They will know far more about the game and spend their entire time running away whilst swet drips from their face. I'm not speaking about anyone in particular here, Zebedee, but the swet is so thick I can feel it through my headset and it suggests you should proabably stop before your body exfoliates itself to death.

In short, this is a good game but it is imperative to understand that as a player you are rendered useless by stupid overpowered try hard ""friends"" who somehow find the most idiotic ways of killing you. through walls, from the sky heck, even when they're not looking at you.

Finally, on occasion when you shoot someone point blank they don't die. But when your try hard friends shoot they kill you, even across the map with a pistol, it's over.",Recommended,40,14

3 years have passed since I have bought this game and it will soon become delisted from Steam... Honestly it will be the end for me. Through this years I cant find anything thats can replace or compare with DG. The game where you can do frame perfect techs like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ speedrunner and its not even a thing for average players. The game where you can play with 8 friends at once. The game where you can teach programming to become modder. The game where you can meet so many great people. I dont envy newcomers who havent seen whole picture of the game. They think that this game is good for a group of friends for couple of evenings but not for me. I think that DG is a lot more than this at least for me... Someone says that 1000 hours - is the end for the game, but for me its just a begginning. Rest in peace Duck Game
This review was made when I had 500 hours:
My first review of my first purchased game. DUCK GAME at first glance, an ordinary game where ducks run and kill each other in different ways, everyone thinks so at the beginning. By the way, the beginning of the game in Duck Game is a test of your nerves and how persistent you are. Something like 2b2t, don't you think? There are few newcomers to DG, but they are there. The first 0-100 hours is the first stage of your verification, and if you pass it, you will open the way to the next stage. Stage 2 - you want to play DG, but you don't know how to play it and start asking everyone how to do D Shoots, how to do Ragdoll Jump and many other techniques. Many community players will not tell you anything, but simply destroy you, but there is a small percentage of players who will help you and tell you. So if you see a good player or your friend is playing this great game, don't be afraid to ask them different things. Speaking of the community, it is very concise, which is kind of good, but it seems to be bad. Sometimes you can't find a game, but you always play and see the same players. You start communicating with each other and getting to know each other among others. Also in Duck Game there are cheaters, but there are good cheaters who will just be fun and show, for example, how they play musical instruments or just show what they can do or even tell you how they did it. And Yes, many cheats in DG modify themselves. So if you see a suspicious player, do not immediately levitate or kick them, but look at what they are doing. If he will destroy you and will not even let you get out, then feel free to leave. This also applies to bad players - pingers, campers, etc. I would never have thought that a simple game like DG would involve me in music, programming, and drawing pixels. In DG, you can draw your own textures for weapons, ducks, maps, and so on. You can also draw your own caps. You can find all this on the Internet or do it yourself. Those who seek will always find it. Speaking of music, if you have a gamepad, then start playing with it from the very beginning, because then you will be very long to get rid of the keyboard and it will take you a lot of time and a bonus to this you will be able to play musical instruments and quack in different tones. About programming - this is due to mods and cheats, as I said before, they can be modified. If you are very bored, you can play with your friends in DG mods. I recommend this game, but you must either play it or not play it at all. This is the best game I've played, am playing, and will play so far. If you not laziness write +rep. And try not to lose your friends ;) Good luck! See you in the DUCK GAME.",Recommended,20,4

Been playing this game with my friends for 3 years, almost every Thursday night.
This is the only couch co-op game that we keep playing on a regular basis

Gameplay

The gameplay is fluid and fast paced, with no input delay
Controls are easy to get the hang of
There's a lot of variety with weapons and maps
The skill ceiling became extremely high after we discovered angled shots
You can set the amount of rounds that you want in a match before starting
You can set the amount of rounds you want before an intermission, that shows the amount of rounds each player has won, this makes it more intense for the winning player as the others may capitalize and target the winning player


Its fun to devise strategies for maps so that you can throw the opponents off, or get to weapons faster than they can
There's also a ton of cosmetic items like hats and room decorations which are a nice touch
Extremely good soundtrack
The recent content update (1.5) added a lot more weapons and maps as well as soundtracks
It's also really cool that you can make custom hats and maps
If you are lacking weapons, maps or hats, you can always browse through the steam workshop




It's the perfect game to play with your friends and family couch co-op style
Suitable for all ages
Love seeing the look on my friends' faces when they die to a cooked grenade which was thrown from a mile away
Getting trickshot by a sniper is a whole other story, this really brings out the frustration and intensity
The heart sinking feeling when you stand on a mine and you know, that if you move, you're gone
Induces you with fear when you try to mash out of a cobweb before you're thrown off the edge
The sense of joy when you kill 3 ducks with a collateral is unrivaled

This game is really fun, especially in multiplayer. Has a silliness smash vibe to it. However, I can see some people getting a bit bored after awhile because a lot of levels and weapons do end up being the same.

Were he alive today, he would simply have said ""Happiness is when ducks are placed in arenas to fight in glorious free-for-alls with all kinds of crazy and fun weapons.""

Cons:
- Netcode is weird; Lag seems to favor players with worse ping. I've often realized I've been shot just BEFORE an opponent stepped into range.
- There's no tutorial, so to learn the ropes you just have to get your arse kicked.
- No bots. Arcade mode has single-player challenges which admittedly helps, but only utilizes a handful of items in very specific scenarios.",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 0,1

This is a honestly one of the coolest games I've played...




Awesome multiplayer (lot of screaming) (can also add multiple controllers into one pc) , the whole game is setup so you can change almost all the variables in the game (gravity, (DIY) hats, guns, spawns, (DIY) maps, etc.), you barely need anything to run the game on your computer (seriously, the requirements are very low), whoever developed this game has a great sense of humor, and it's just fun to play...

The campiagn is a little dull in my opinion, so I would plan on playing it with somebody. Multiplayer can be a little laggy with lower end systems (so count on unfair kills...).

you can even make your own levels easily.

Feeling like you want to play something but nothing looks good in your library? Can't quite get into solo narrative titles or other multiplayer products anymore? Need something casual, but engaging? This game is the answer to all those feelings. As I get older I feel I'm losing interest in video games but this one keeps bringing me back and it's always satisfying.

Simple, great arcade-y fun. Get friends together and quack for victory as you blast the hell out of each other. And with the surplus of custom content constantly being added to the Workshop, the replay value never diminishes. Easy controls, but not devoid of tech either. Great couch party title for people looking for something simple to pick up and play.

Will say however this game shines brightest when you're playing with friends, not so much with randos or doing the single player stuff.",Recommended,12 people found this review helpful 0,0

Each round of multiplayer is on a new map, and you need to be the last duck standing to win the round. Win ten rounds and waddle away from those other loser ducks as you leave with the trophy. The game also has single player mini-game challenges for a variety of gameplay.

This is still one of me and my friends' favorite go to games.

PROS:
* A Very Enjoyable Experience, especially with ""Local Multiplayer"" for up to 4 players ()
* Lots of varying weaponry (and defenses) make each level feel non-repetitive.
* There are a few different ways to play, but most of the time this feels akin to Smash Brothers (and that's a positive for me).

CONS:
*

Verdict: A Worthy Purchase! Recommended if you like arena brawlers, and highly recommended for its local multiplayer.

I play this often in our house, and Steam Family Sharing makes this a great investment for a family or group of friends. I would have purchased a 4-pack for my friends and family; however, the Steam store originally only sold the game individually. It's worth it to get the 4-pack!",Recommended,32 people found this review helpful 0,0

Duck Game

I absolutely love local coop games and inviting friends over and yelling at the TV. This is a local coop game online. Everyone on the same screen quacking away. I have played with some friends over Skype and it was a blast! The controls are very tight and it surprisingly has quite a bit of skill involved. I first heard about it from ""Total Biscuit"", he normally is very cynical and skeptical when reviewing a game but for the first time ever I saw him just having a grand old time and laughing. I knew, I had to get this game. So much fun and the quacking never gets old. There is actually a dedicated ""quack"" button. It may look like a little timewaster and people are going to say that ""It's too expensive"" and what not but IMO no, it's not. I have only played a few hours so far and I know I'll be spending ALOT more.

Duck game is 2d instant kill arena shooter.
The mechanics of the game are really simple - you need to use items around you to eliminate other ducks.
You can pick up and throw items, and you can use items. That's it, just two buttons.
And by ""use"" I mean a range of actions - from shooting the gun, to playing musical instruments, to throwing bananas around.
And you never know what comes next (kinda warioware-like) - you have to react very quick to your surroundings and changes in them (yes, you can blow up half of the level using bazooka).

Shoot, run, throw, jump, fly, jetpack, go crazy.
If you are into online multiplayer games - go for it.
If you have friends and 2-4 gamepads (and some alcohol) - go for it (but watch out for possible fighting in real life after losing!)
If you don't like crazy 2d games with simple mechanics - don't go for it, there's not much beyond that very simple combat there.

At first glance, this might look like an average 2d shooter with pixel graphics (not hard to find such games, right?). However after a couple of rounds of the Duck Game, you will probably realize, that you have just found a diamond in a pile of coal.

The game is very easy to pickup, but that doesn't mean it is basic. You can:
slide under rockets,
set rooms on fire,





the list goes on

Multiplayer is THE gamemode, however singleplayer challenges will help you pickup flashy moves like grinding the floor with chainsaw to move faster, or utilizing guns to jump higher and further.

Also it has hats.",Recommended,13,0

Disclaimer: You MUST, I repeat, MUST have friends to play this game with, playing with strangers without voice chat is no fun, really.
With that out of the way, duck game is no doubt my favorite game of the year (2017's), because of the fantastic job Landon did on the game, the effort people put into the music, the texture, the guns, the editor, the EVERYTHING. Everything in this game is just so fun, so well designed.

You know these games, these games people make for youtubers to play that are fun the first 2 hours and then just get dull, boring, repetitive?
Duck game aint none of that ♥♥♥♥. It's fun fun fun, you'll laugh so much it'll hurt. And even (almost) 200 hours later, I'm still laughing, having fun with my mates, using mods, creating stages, etc.
I'll list the pros/cons and you'll decide whether it's worth full price or not. I payed full price, I'm from a poor country and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game was worth it (Also, it's been going on a 50% sale lately, after a whole year without going on sale!)
Pros
Well designed predefined levels, that are actually balanced no matter how much people you play with
Levelling sistem that doesn't give players in-game advantages, but allows your preparation room to look dope af (We waited almost 2 years for this update!)
Balanced gameplay and weapons that leave room for advanced techniques

-Quick Review-
Duck Game is a 4-player, 2d shooter brawler battle arena style game developed by Landon Podbielski and released June, 2015.

-Detailed breakdown review-
Gameplay: There are basically two game modes, Arcade mode which is a single player version of Duck Game, where you choose between themed levels and race against the clock to get best times and the highest scores/trophies.


...And the 4-player battle mode where you're pitted against 3 other players (either friends, or randoms) in an all out fowl display of turducken destruction.


The controls for Duck Game are simple enough, basica movement with either a keyboard or controller, and shoot. There are a plethora of weapons and zones to fight in, and that's what keeps the game fresh and exciting.
...Well, that and screaming at your friends or vise versa.


Oh! I forgot the most important button... the ""quack"", my favorite, by far.

There's not much else to say about Duck Game because by design it's a simple game you can pick up, play a few rounds with friends, and go do something else.


I got out of it exactly what I was hoping for. If you'd like an idea of how the game looks I would welcome you to check out my video on the game... but since I wasn't playing with friends, it's not quite as fun as the utter chaos you normally experience while playing.",Recommended,9,0

I remember i played such tank pvp games long time ago in early 90s. Retro is cool nowadays so this game is cool too:-)

but, for real, there are a huge variation of weapons + leveling up allows you to spend talent points and so customize your tank.

The game offers variety of pvp games such as assasination, point game, deathmatch and a juggernaut game where one player plays against everyone else.

If you get bored about pvp then you can try one of the 80-90 single player mission aswell, some of them very challenging.

Those of us old enough to remember the game Scorched Earth will instantly recognize its spirit in ShellShock. Featuring an insane array of weapons, customizable tank bits, and maps, ShellShock will keep you playing for hours.

Unlocking new weapons and other bits doesn't feel like a grind at all. You earn them by leveling up, using other weapons until they get better, or by sheer luck of the draw. The in-game store has a bunch of different addons you can buy for your tank, but THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO IN-GAME MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. Period. Everything you can buy in the in-game store is bought using ""Gears"" that you earn by actually playing the game. In an age where aggressive micro-transactions are seen as a legit business model, it's refreshing to see a game that does things right.",Recommended,43 people found this review helpful 0,1

AND A HUGE BUT

The community I've encountered is totally toxic.
Win a match against the host? Kicked.
Land a snipe? Kicked.
Someone even slightly accuses you of hacking? Kicked.
Land a shot the host can't because he sucks? Kicked.
Use a weapon host hasn't unlocked? Kicked.
These are all the things I've encountered time and time again and its tiring.

I like this game, I really do, but majority of the players are butthurt too easily, and childish af

The community is toxic as hell, the game itself is fine but the community ruins it for me.

With over 2100 hours in this incredibly affordable and fun game, an honest and thoughtful review from me is long overdue.

First of all I have to say, the amount of effort that has obviously been put into this should have warranted a price of way more than 7€. With also the option to buy this game in a 4 pack, making each copy another 2€ cheaper, this is incredibly generous and for long time players like me as well as for literally anyone who played more than like 3 rounds the money was definitely well spent.
Basically what you are buying is the opposite of an FPS-Shooter as you get as much time as you need to figure out in which exact direction and with how much power to shoot best.

There is an owerwhelming number and variety of different weapons and modes, of which many require their own and unique strategies, making for a lot of small things that even I haven´t yet figured out, and I frequently encounter other experienced players who haven´t either. All that is to say, this game should not get boring anytime soon if your goal is to perfect yourself.
Some bugs that haven`t gotten a fix or even a fixing attempt in years exist, but they are very minor and can even somewhat be exploited. Updates with new content happen rarely but surely. A big plus is that even if your PC is a literal potato it will probably run this game rather smoothly. The dev used to be playing regularly too, but, well, at least neither I nor anyone I know has seen him recently.

Most important to know however is that while it is possible to play alone, having a few friends with you will improve your experience here by a lot, I cannot stress enough how much of a difference one or more conversation partners might make. With game sizes of up to 8 players, everyone should be accommodated. If you´re like me you could also make some online friends, there are a lot of genuinely nice folks to find if you are lucky. With enough time and the help of discord or something comparable, it might start to feel more like a primitive social network than a tank game if you´re a talkative person. Sadly, the other end of the spectrum, such as rude and obnoxious players or people who seem to enjoy throwing profanities around, also has its fair share. You´ll meet players from all around the world, but for some reason, Germans (like me), Norwegians and Americans are the most common. Make of that what you will.

Before I end this review, there is one major downside here: The leveling system. There are a total of 100 levels to achive by earning xp from each round you play. This by itself is nothing bad, but after you reach level 85, each subsequent level becomes an unbearable grind. For reference, the xp requirement scales exponentially, so that level 90 is about a tenth and level 96 half of the xp it takes to reach level 100. For even further reference, getting all the way to level 100 took me exactly 785 hours and from what I gathered it is not uncommon for this number to be over 1000 hours even. Dedicated players generally sit at level 99 for months and it is understandably frustrating for them. Also, some game modes give way wayyy more xp than others, which leads to the least lucrative ones seeing little to no play at all, which is quite sad because they are just as much fun.

In conclusion, do consider spending your money here if you:
- are looking for a game to play with your friends or want to make new ones
- don´t mind slow progressing
- have a crappy PC that can´t run anything else
- liked the original worms game because this is basically the same thing with different design

If you read everything until here and meet me in game at some point, do tell me cause I´d be really interested in how many people actually read these. Until then!",Recommended,34 people found this review helpful 7,6

As much as I like this game, I seriously can't give it a recommendation in good conscience.

I've been playing it for a decent while so I'm at a satisfactory point, so why am I saying I don't recommend the game? Easy. This is probably the most unfriendly game towards newer players that I've ever seen.

First and foremost, playing with randoms here is a nightmare. They're usually not very welcoming people, usually very toxic, and are mostly only going to want to join lobbies for EXP grinding, which takes a long time by the way, so that option's out the window. What if they want to play with friends that have been playing for some time? Well too bad, should've joined them at the same time they started playing, because you're going to be severely under equipped while your friends painfully outclass you and destroy you every game. Sure, there's single player content to help with leveling a little bit, but it doesn't get you too far, and after that leveling is only possible in multiplayer. Newer players simply have zero chance that it's not even funny. If they want to catch up, then just waste a massive chunk of your life grinding in multiplayer, easy right?

I might be at a point where the game is fun to play on my end, but this game is simply way too unfun for newer players because the weapon balancing between early level and late level weapons is absolutely busted in favor of the late level players, not to mention tank upgrades.",Not Recommended,178,10

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I played a version of this game back in the early 90's and loved it then. We had a single cannon shot to obliterate the landscape and attempt to destroy our opponent. Shellshock Live includes over 250 weapons, I had hesitations that this would work. Sometimes too much variety can be overload.

Gladly this game has a massive grind to open up all the weapons. I hate grinding in games, especially in PVP games. So why do I think it is good in this case? Well, the basic weapons are enough to enjoy the game to its full and recently the playerbase got a MASSIVE influx due to popular streamers publicising the game. Meaning you are pitched against other players of same experience with same weapon loadouts. I can imagine it could've been a problem with a small playersbase but not now.

Maybe preferably I'd like to have access to all weapons without a grind and be able to custom select which to include on the server I create or join a server that has a selection I like to play with. 250+ weapons is a LOT to get to grips with so maybe the devs have implemented their introductions in the best way. Time will tell...

One thing I didn't realise with Shellshock Live was that the most popular way of playing isn't turn-based but actually phase-based. So every player is setting their power and trajectory and deciding which weapon to launch at the same time. The result is very little waiting time for other players!! It keeps the game and the fun flowing extremely effectively.

Touraments have been added recently, I can't wait to try those!

The game is simple looking in design but the graphics are clean and effective.

I'll be spending a lot fo time in Shellshock for sure, highly recommmended!!",Recommended,124,15

Do you remember that Flash tank game on miniclip or armorgames or newgrounds?
Well Buckle the ♥♥♥♥ up 'cause that guy just remade this game on steam it's not only nostalgic, but very addictive too.


1. You get the full game.
No DLC's or in-game purchases, everybody gets the same FULL game.

2. A lot of fun with friends.
This baby can handle up to 8 friends, or ex-friends after you annihilate them into Oblivion

3. No friends? No worries.
There's a full single player campaign with a ♥♥♥♥-load of missions. Some of them are pretty fun + you can learn how to use some of the weapons. Speaking of...


From Single Shot to shooting a Seagull that poops out... well, poop! It's amazing that almost every weapon is unique but that's not all. You can level up your favorite weapon to an even more deadly shot!


You have your classics like deathmatch and Free-for-All. But have you ever heard of Shoccer or Rebound (My personal favorite)? You'll have fun playing these different modes, all interchangeble like HP, Wind and mods.


You don't level up with DLC and microtransactions. You level up and get stronger by playing!


There is an in-game currency called Gears. You collect these while playing games. you can't buy them or cheat your way collecting them. Customize your tank, your victory song and buy special weapons only available in the shop!

It's basically a remake of the classic Scorched Earth with even more weapons, game modes, and multiplayer. You may want to start leveling up with single player quests, but if you don't mind being an underdog for the first few hours, you can skip that.

As for the early access status: There are frequent updates, but the game is more or less stable, I've yet to found an annoying bug.

There are a lot of different game modes that you can choose from, all are about hitting something in some way.

All in all, this game is a great way to kill an hour or two in a boring evening.

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2020 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.",Recommended,194,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have played shellshock live 2 on the browser for quite a while before I played the steam version. One thing I did not like in the browser version is in game purchases which they took out in the steam version. So I am really happy about that. It gives everyone an even ground and provides fair combat.

I love the steam version and would recommend it to anyone having an interest in artillery games.
Here is the pros and cons for shellshock live.

PROS:

1. Simple yet elegant graphics design. One does not get bored looking at it.

2. The massive amounts of weapons to obtain and upgrade. At the time I wrote this review, there are 367 weapons including the upgrades.

3. Active developer and community. The developer works with the player community to constantly improve the game with new content, new features or bug fixes.

4. Many game modes to choose from ( 8 I believe). With countless customization options that will satisfy every need. For example, you want to play with players your level, you can do that, you want a more fun and challenging game play, you can set mods to one weapons and wind to high etc.

5. 4 sections of tank upgrades to master!

5. And many more!

CONS?

1. Time consuming. Is it? I have played for 60 hours and I am already level 83. I know the game is a grind, but isn't every multiplayer game? For example, I played warframe for 360 hours, or grinded for 360 hours. Shellshock live in my opinion is a grind, yes, but compared to some other ""popular"" games out there, it is not a grind at all. I know low level is frustrating and everyone wants to level up, everyone wants to win. But be patient and you will eventually reach level 80 in 100 hours. Besides, the real grind starts at level 90. Unless you're hardcore and want to get every single achievement. Which I advise to not to do if you want a social life... Don't make such a big deal out of it!

2. The music gets repetitive after a while and sounds boring, but that's not a big deal. Just run some music in the background or something.

3. Hackers? This is also a big deal according to a lot of people. IT IS NOT! I have yet to see a hacker in the 60 hours i played. And besides, the latest updates reinforced security to eliminate the piratically non-existent hackers. And also, people complain about rulers......... yes, there are people who use rulers, but there are multiple ways you can take care of this. First, play a game with them, and lose, then set atmospheric nudge to ON, or set high wind, and then play the next game, and then accuse them of using a ruler, and they will be too ashamed to admit it and leave... and yeah.



Overall, shellshock live is a really fun and addictive game to pass the extra times you have. There is so much to do, so much to learn and so much rage when you miss a shot.... ayyyy.

In the beginning of my tank playing years, along with early computers, I played Pocket Tanks. After that, i played a flash game called ""Tanks"". After that, i played Shellshock Live back when it was a Kongregate flash game. Now, i play Shellshock Live on Steam. This is probably the closest thing you can get to Pocket Tanks nowadays, the only difference being the upgraded graphics and effects. The only thing you cant do in this game that you could do in Pocket Tanks, is place/create dirt.

All in all, a good game to waste time on, no matter if its 5min or 5hrs.

I'm nearing 1,000 hours of playtime, and the 2020 Steam Awards give me a reason to finally write a short review for this game, so here goes.


It's the successor to a flash game, yes, and you can tell, but that doesn't make it bad.
ShellShock Live has a core objective as simple as can be: Select a weapon, fire it and defeat your opponent(s). The great thing about it is that it's easy to get into and become addicted. It's a game anyone can pick up and start playing without much introduction. It's one of those ""easy to learn, hard to master"" games, because if you want to ""git gud"" and be consistently victorious, you'll have to develop a feel for it.

An important aspect of a game like this is replayability. Its variety is limited, in a way, but ShellShock Live overcomes this quite well with an impressive arsenal of different weapons (unlockable in various ways), a neat selection of game modes - some more difficult than others - and ultimately, allowing and encouraging different playstyles. It can become grindy; if you want to reach the highest level, unlock all achievements, or reach that #1 spot on the leaderboard (good luck), you'll need to invest time. But none of this is a requirement, you can just as easily set up a round with your friends and mess about for an hour or two.

This game doesn't need an in-depth review, there is not that much to tell. Having just been released from Early Access, if it looks at all interesting to you, give it a try. It's not big, so it downloads quickly, you're not going to spend the first ten hours getting used to it, and hell, if you really don't like it, it's not very expensive. It's a simple game that has grown up.",Recommended,30 people found this review helpful 3,0

Overall: 9/10


ShellShock Live is the perfect example of an indie game with true longevity. Despite first coming out in 2015, 9 years ago, and officially reaching 1.0 status in 2020, This multiplayer 2D strategy tank game excels due to its blend of strategic depth, accessible gameplay, and captivating visuals.
ShellShock marries turn-based mechanics with real-time strategy, demanding careful consideration of each move, weapon choice, and environmental factors like wind and terrain. With HUNDREDS of unique and satisfying weapons and gadgets, you can develop creative strategies and adapt your playstyle as you progress and unlock more weapons to use and upgrades for your tank. This is especially true since you can reset your tank's improvements every week and redistribute them across the four branches of tank upgrades.
The customization options, while slightly limited, do add a personal touch as you can change minor things like your tank's appearance, and the map color (if you're hosting).
The main reason to play ShellShock in 2024 is for sure its accessible gameplay; It can be a great passive time killer. In the most basic sense, the game is easy to learn yet challenging to master. Within 30 minutes you can definitely get a feel for the game but even if that's not the case, ShellShock has an entire single player campaign full of levels all the way from trick shots to 2 v 2's against the AI to help you hone your skills and level up.
The biggest problem with ShellShock these days is that while the multiplayer focus enhances replayability and can offer both casual fun and intense competition, that same focus can be detrimental to the game in terms of player count, due to the game's age. As could probably be expected, any game that is almost a decade old will have trouble maintaining a player base, but especially multiplayer indie games. That is somewhat true here, as there are usually random active lobbies you can join at whatever time during the day and have a good enough time with, or you could host a lobby and get a full 3v3 with randoms in around 5 minutes or so, but this is absolutely not consistent. There are times where the game is basically dead, but to be honest, I think these kind of games are meant to be played with a personal group of friends anyway. There is certainly fun to be had with random players, but you're going to consistently have better time playing with people you know.


TL;DR:

ShellShock is an amazing indie multiplayer turn-based strategy game that is just as much fun now as it was in its prime, has very satisfying visuals, easy to grasp gameplay, and endless replayability. Regardless of the general player base not being as active these days, there's still plenty of new and veteran players to play with, but the game exceptionally thrives when you're playing with your friends anyway and for the price point, it is a MUST PLAY!",Recommended,32,13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Now I'll preface with the fact that the many hours I've played this it isn't the game itself I'm giving a negative review for, it's the playerbase and the servers that makes this game so unfun to play.

Since this is a negative review I'll begin with why I'm giving it such a review:

- 90% of the games people make are 'XP farms' which involve all the players moving to the centre of the map and shooting themselves in one big group, and the rest are '4.08x XP' Rebound games that take almost 40 minutes to finish if you're lucky. Any attempt I make to make other games such as Juggernaut or the other unexplored game modes results in literally nobody joining, thus making no games possible.

- Since there's no punishment for leaving other than losing the XP you would've gained in that battle, people will simply leave early if they think they aren't going to win, giving the other team an advantage and the rest of the team a much more difficult fight.

- For whatever reason, the servers have a tendency to randomly disconnect you from games, simply removing you from them for literally no reason. You can't control it, it just happens whenever it wants to. I can't have fun in actually battles because I'm constantly afraid of just being booted from them, like I was on the last one before I got DC'd, and that the entire enemy team left.

Better put, the game would be brilliant if it had an actually functioning playerbase and servers.

NOW, the reason I've put so many hours into this despite this is how many problems I have with the playerbase is how fantastically designed the game is.

- The visuals are brilliant. The tanks, land and sky are simple and smooth, and everything is easy to tell apart. The tank accessories are stylish, the UIs are clean, and the weapons' effects are stellar. It's clear a lot of work went into the weapons, as I'll be about to explain.

- The titanic array of weapons makes earning weapons and playing with them such a fun experience. The game has easily 200+ weapons that can be earned in all kinds of ways: via achievements, the gear shop, levelling up, challenges. There's so many weapons and so many ways to get them that it almost feels neverending, and that's a great thing in a game like this. The weapons are all so different too that you almost feel like a god when you learn what they do, and learn how to use them. They all have different kinds of uses too, so you'll rarely be out of options. Some are risk-reward-based, some are purely for utility, and some are amazing when you know how they work.

- The single player challenges are somewhat fun, but some of them aren't very fun, especially the AI-based ones since making challenging yet fun AIs is always a challenge. Of course, you get some nice weapons from them, so it's always worth doing just to expand your arsenal.

- The selection of 8 creatively-made gamemodes makes it difficult to be bored in this game, even if no one plays them. I always like setting up Juggernaut games because I like the idea of everyone taking down a superpowered player.

All in all, I think ShellShock is a GREAT game, but it's really the half-brained playerbase and the bad servers that make it hard to enjoy, even with everything that I like about it. Now, if you were playing this with a group of friends in a lobby together this would be perfect, but that's really the only circumstance I can think of that someone could legitimately enjoy this game now.",Not Recommended,58 people found this review helpful 0,1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is incredibly the best multiplayer tank game I've played & enjoyed on Steam ever! Despite having toxic community with gross personalities and expert players with great accuracy as I mostly don't count them for reviewing the multiplayer games.

This game is a lot like the main Worms series but with tanks, explosions and realistic terrain. Gosh, I love tank games like this! Even one of the greatest Worms-inspired official games on the gaming systems ever! Also a real video game now as it is the Steam version so everyone and I have to refer this as the actual ShellShock Live since it's like as made for Nintendo Wii U, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One too.

This game's got:
• 8 player sma- I mean... match (Wow!)
• 8 game modes to play, enjoy & even master
• About a hundred of weapons to unlock, use & level up as weapon levels are not counted
• A lot of color themes for terrains to make the matches more cool & stylish
• So much match settings including the turn time
• The true maximum level of 100 that takes about a year to level up to from the beginning
• The final boss with his name based on Master Hand from the Super Smash Bros. series
• No spaghetti

Even though I am a Nintendo & Touhou fangirl, this game is still enjoyable for me to play despite it being much smaller than Team Fortress 2. I can even do YouTube videos of this great game similar to KoopaKungFu, WiiLikeToPlay and also Superjombombo who are three of my favorite YouTubers. Neppu neppu!

Becareful of the toxic community as it's a problem that have half chance of making 9 years & younger boys break their PC with their rage. Luckily, Steam has the COPPA so you don't ever have to worry about breaking your PC with your rage since the age requirement. Still becareful if you are a cute teen girl gamer as there's even some middle-aged men (and bronies) that are very gross instead.

I shall become the very best player of this game, like no one ever was. Oh wait, how about I shall level up to 100 and complete every challenges instead?",Recommended,76,2

If you played in the old classic sample of this game it would be very awesome for you to experience the atmosphere of this one.

Well, at the very beginning of playing this game, you will have to pass some stages by to earn XP to level up and at the same time you will earn rewards and unlocks to become more experienced.
Upgrade your items, tank and arsenal. more than 210 of game's weapons can be upgraded to more powerful ones. thats everything about beginning.

Then, you will be ready for online games but please try it with friends before ruining games of others. But online,
""What's there in store for us?""
Fully destructible terrain that creates a dynamically changing battlefield. And promise of funny energetics and emothions is a fact and i even hope you will cherish them for a long time.

One more plus once you bought the game you bought everything. All that you can get will earned by playing, not paying :D

So, I'm absolutely sure if you are respected game collector in steam you should buy it.

Worth playing.",Recommended,34,2

If your looking for a game you can play with your viewers/friends, that never gets old, offers endless hours of gameplay and is priced below $7... then ShellShock LIVE (SSL) is the game for you.

SSL offers all of its content without the need to buy DLC, a small campaign and a developer that is active in the community.

I recommend SSL after almost 400 hours of gameplay, 200+ new friends and 250k views on YouTube. Purchase SSL for yourself and a friend today, you won't be disappointed.

This game is a bit tricky to master, but I've had a lot of fun with it so far. The aiming system is pretty good, definitely has consistency. Active playerbase, and the devs have been real good with pushing out content for the game so far.

This game has so many unique weapons its ridiculous. You pick up a random crate and get a weapon that you probably have no idea eveen existed, and your'e like ""Whoa what's this?"" until you fire it and get some pretty explosive results.

It's fun and looks great, and has a bunch of content including 200+ weapons that do a whole bunch of things.

However it's locked off behind levels and ranks so unless you've poured 600 hours into the game you're going to find that most of the elitist community will destroy you instantly and tell you to work for your fun, which is tricky when there is a very limited playerbase. You'll be stuck on those basic weapons forever unless you have friends at the same levels as you, ensuring the game is actually half-way balanced.

I like the game but find it hard to recommend to people starting off, as its huge grind factor to get to the fun stuff is very offputting.",Not Recommended,118,7

These are 671.7 hours that I won't ever see again

Jokes aside, I highly discourage you from playing this game unless you're just like me. A child who had seen his favorite YouTubers post videos frequently and really wished for the chance to play with them (never happened). Regardless, I used to frequently play this game daily and pretty much got to the point I am comfortable writing this review.

Shellshock Live is a game in which your success is highly determined by the numbers of your display. If your friends or randos you meet drastically overlevel you, you practically have zero chances of overpowering them unless one or more of the following happen(s):
1. The high level is in the middle of a lobotomy and cannot aim for you
2. You have astronomical levels of luck
3. The high level has gone easy on you
4. The high level just had to leave the game
If that doesn't happen, get ready to be whooped.

As a high level player, low level players will kick you out their lobby for daring to join. As a low level player, high level players will crush you while openly mocking your shortness of good weapons and experience (lord forbid you don't play this game as often or as hardcore as they do). Of course, a decent chunk of the playerbase is cool. The other chunk, however, makes people like you and me reconsider the First Amendment.

The game itself is fine, but it lacks heavily in some aspects:
1. The games Skill Rating system is entirely style, no substance. You have a number that goes higher when you win and lower when you lose and that is it. There's no considerations for any skill shots or displays of high damage, no consideration of the gamemode and no consideration of whether you've used up any items or not.
2. The entirety of the Shoccer gamemode is extremely poor and makes me question whether it wasn't just added because the devs just enjoy the IRL sport. One good example of this modes shortcoming is that shots programmed to go for the tank will do just that, contradicting the gamemode's goal of hitting that stupid ball that behaves as appropriately as the current Twitter CEO
3. Shoccer sucks, seriously. I've not met a single player who wasn't playing it for the achievement
4. The chatbox on the main menu is littered with absolute garbage, most of the time.

That said, this game has some redeeming qualities:
1. Many of the weapons are fun to use and look good
2. Your Rebound shots can be a display of the fact you can do more than the players who stick to 100 86 in Deathmatches as if their life was actually on the line
3. The music is really pleasant to listen to
4. More stuff that you might appreciate that I simply don't bother to count up

In addition, you can upgrade your tank in 4 different categories (Chassis, Track, Gun, Luck) with skill points, which you get through level ups. You can fight in 9 different game modes on many different maps. There are 100 levels in total and many different tasks, some of them are very tricky. ShellShock Live is a classic in this genre.

""Gorillas from 1991, but now with tanks and lots of content.""
The genius simplicity of QBASIC's Gorillas [en.wikipedia.org] from 1991 paired with tanks and over 200 weapons is a great recipe, also in the year 2017. Choose a weapon, set the angle, set the strength, shoot - that is it, that's the whole game. Shellshock is a great simple strategic turn based game, especially with/against friends.


+ great multiplayer
+ great fun, chaff & anger
+ over 200 weapons
+ a lot of features / modes
+ replayability / learning curve
+ many players online
+ no lags / no bugs
+ option for a 4pack
+ whole implementation


- unlockable stuff is too expensive
- no gorillas anymore",Recommended,22,11

Now before you judge me for Not recommending this game please, give me the chance to explain.

SSL (Or Shellshock Live) is a fantastic game, hand down it's great and I clearly remember the browser game I played for over a decade ago. If you're at all even the least interested in this game I strongly suggest buying it!

''Why did you not recommend it then you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!''

Well it's because of a very game breaking bug this great game has, it has been a problem the developers simply dosn't seem to be able to fix. However it dosn't affect everyone, it affects an unknown amount of people but for the people who does have this bug the game is flat out unplayable.

It's slowly getting know as the connect bug or the infinet connect bug. In short it's simply your game that disconnect every few minutes (Even in singleplayer), deeming the game unplayable.

If you experience this bug don't get your hopes up for a fix, no fix have been found and the developers have tried to fix it since it first arose...",Not Recommended,257,52

This game was bought to me by a dear friend, just so we have yet another game we can play together. I didn't play it that much because I was so low level compared to the rest of my friends. One day I decided that I'm gonna grind myself to the same level as the highest among my friends, so it would be a bit more fun for me. Well, I ended up grinding even higher, currently sitting at 500k xp, half way to an achievement I really want and already past the half way mark to level 100. Though the real struggle is the grind to level 100, but I see it only as fair. Wouldn't want it to be too easy.

Another good thing about this game is its community. I love it. I've played closer to 1,5k hours on Overwatch and over 1k hours on CS, their community is no where close to SSL community. Many high levels recognize my name and I recognize them. It's just amazing how great the community is.

It brings nostalgia to me due to playing a similar game as a kid with my friends. Shellshock overtook the spot as my favorite game on Steam due to some small things, two which of was already mentioned.

This game is amazing, those are my final words for this review.",Recommended,17,0

This game is fun, just not fun for lower level players. Its a good game to relax and chill to.

Once you reach level 75 - 80 you start unlocking the good weapons as well as weapon upgrades. Once you get past that you have to beat players that have a protractor taped to their screen to land shots.

If you are a Kongregate user, you are well aware of this.
Game used to be in Flash, but now is in Unity. A big jump in game engine, and it's ever so good. I'm not fond of Unity, but I'll grant an exception to this.
No need for a membership to enjoy everything this has to offer, but since this is Early Access, you never know when a VIP membership might arise. A license alone never suffices the cost of servers these days.

Overview
ShellShock Live may sound familiar to you even if you haven’t heard of this Steam version yet, because the game has been a fairly popular Flash title for quite a long time. Neither this nor the flash versions are incredibly unique or original titles, but that isn’t to say that they don’t compete well. It certainly seems a bit strange to title a game something that essentially translates to “P.T.S.D. Live”. But it is a game about tanks and massive weaponry so I suppose it makes sense.

ShellShock Live is a two dimensional tank game, where each player takes turns firing from their random assortment of weapons. Before you have leveled or progressed at all, you will already have a very wide range of different types of weapons to use. As you play, you’ll level up your account and your weapons, giving you all sorts of new weapons and upgraded versions of the same weapons. This is definitely one of the most fun aspects of the game, the sheer amount of different tools to play with.

The idea of so many varying weapons somewhat throws balance out the window, when each match you are randomly assigned a set of weapons from your unlocked options. You may have weapons where everything you have is hard to aim and low damage, then you may have another game where you have multiple massive AoE nuke weapons. As you level up you will also earn upgrade points that you can use to modify your tanks overall stats as well. This includes things such as how mobile it is, its armor, critical damage, luck, and a few other bonuses tacked onto those stats. These stats plus the upgraded weapons makes it less fair when fighting players of vastly different levels, but well aimed shots and some lucky RNG can quickly make up the difference. If you are still bothered by the imbalance, there are some game options for avoiding big level gaps, or even balancing out the weapons across players.

Matches in ShellShock Live tend to last no more than 10 minutes, unless you’re playing some of the more absurd game modes, such as ones with high health or that require you bounce your shot off a bumper to deal damage. As with most games, it is certainly the most fun if you have some friends that can tag along with you. You can play a mad Free-For-All or team matches with up to 8 players. It is to be noted however, that there is currently no local multiplayer option.

The game is turn based, allowing each player to perfect their angle and power in order to land their shots. Game settings allow you to change between individual turns, team turns, or all players taking their turn simultaneously. There are also several different game modes other than just trying to eliminate your opponents. This includes things such as shooting increasingly smaller targets, or a Juggernaut mode where all players face off against 1 enemy with much greater health. Match options also allow you to do some smaller adjustments like changing the intensity of the wind or overall player health.

The UI is attractive and clean. The bright, neon colors work well for the game’s aesthetics, and are easily readable on a dark background. It’s very easy to navigate the menus, quick to get into a match or to modify your settings. During a match there are clear indicators helping you know where previous shots went, your current power and angle, direction and level of wind, as well as all players’ health.

Mouse and Keyboard works perfectly well. You can drag with your mouse to get your shot’s angle and power near where you want it, and you can use the arrow keys to make smaller adjustments to get it right where it needs to be. These controls are unable to be changed, and I would also recommend against using a controller in the game’s current state. There are some things the controller is just unable to do, such as clicking on “Gear” rewards during a match, or making quick changes to your aim.

ShellShock Live is full of bright, vibrant colors. From the neon tanks and UI to the wide array of different colored weapons. The art style is clean and attractive, and reads well for this type of game. It’s easy to distinguish different weapons from one another while they’re in the air, and many of the weapons special effects are incredibly satisfying.

Even though this is a 2D game they do provide some graphical options upon launching the game. These include windowed mode, resolution, and graphic levels. The graphic settings seem to be the default Unity options and they all seem to be effectively identical.

The game has a few original songs that play in the menus that all sound fairly similar. They’re all very “epic” sounding orchestral themes, that fit pretty well into the downtime between matches. There are also a dozen different short song clips that can be used as “Victory Tunes” which are more varied in their sound. They’re all very fun and playful, and tend to be quite amusing at the end of a match.

Sound effects work well. Menu noise while mousing over options and making selections gets a bit annoying, but you won't spend too much time in the menus. Many of the different weapons use some of the same sounds, but most of them are satisfying enough. There are many silly, fun sounds tied to some of the more strange weapons as well that really ties the feeling of the game together. There’s nothing quite like waiting in fear as the pooping sounds of a Seagull lead to your imminent demise.

ShellShock Live is a fun game. It provides a lot of different options for game modes and weapon variation, as well as giving players many different ways to progress. When you can so easily just play a couple matches a day, the addition of progression really makes it so you want to keep coming back and playing it from time to time. Although there are certainly many other options for similar games, I would say for this price point it’s worth giving it a try with your friends.",Recommended,20 people found this review helpful 0,0

This game is a very fun time-sink for people who want something to grind in the background. That being said, the player base is very old, so the XP Grind is slow and everyone else you play with who are active are much higher level, which means you're unlikely to win often until you're in the high 70s-80s in terms of player level. Also, several of the weapons in the game are just bad, with seemingly no hope of them ever being rebalanced or buffed. New daily quests will be like ""Get a kill with X"" and X could either be great or terrible. The worst part about it though is that I'm pretty sure the chance of you getting that weapon is higher when you have that daily challenge, so it's either do the challenge or be cursed to see that weapon often (I'm looking at you, Counter 3000). The players are toxic and unhinged as well, saying anything from the offensive to the ""lol so quirky xd,"" there's very quite a lot of annoying people, which is a high downside to a game that's mostly a chatroom. If you want to slog for dozens of hours to get to the point where you can have fun in the average game, can ignore terribly toxic people, don't mind the game crippling you with bad weapons as challenges that get forced down your throat, and don't mind that a good handful of the weapons are actually detrimental to unlock because they're so bad, then this game is perfect for you as a normal tank battler. Otherwise, buyer beware.",Not Recommended,30,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Decided I should finally add a review for this.

Anyway it is a much better game than the flash versions with the main P2W element gone all you have to do is pay for the game and you're golden.

The good about this game is straight away the graphics compared to the flash is substantially better to the point of me going back to ssl2 and wondering if the graphics were made worse.

The main negatives are lack of people which can be helped by more people buying the game and due to the vast majority of people owning this game in the american time zones it is rare for me to be able to get a game during the day here, but once again that is only due to the amount of people who own the game.
The weapons are good in most cases but they seem to encourage close range gameplay over mid to long range and the xp requirements are just way to much for some weapons (shot, breaker, bulger to name a few)

But as it is still in early access there is much room for change, improvement and new stuffs.
I recommend people give it a try before you pass it up as it can become addicting ^^
This cat gives it 8/10 at the minute =^_^= €15 well spent

Edit: The game is now almost a year out and now with the recent boom in players it is finally beginning to feel like a decent game. I still recommend this game to all, it is now half the price it started at and at least 10x the player base it started with ^^",Recommended,16,1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
""Imagine Worms but with Tanks""

I found Shellshock Live after watching the Derp Crew screw around for a bit, and since then have found it sliiiightly difficult to let go of myself. It plays tribute to a lot of the older flash games, but remains current due to the one-man dev constantly updating the game with additional content that challenges hardcore and new players alike. The graphics are simple but bright and compelling, and the game offers hours of gameplay whether alone or with a group of friends.

An important aspect of this game that really entices me is the ability to upgrade everything. As you progress through 100 levels, tanks can be upgraded with new skills or parts, and new weapons can be unlocked. These weapons which are constantly being introduced can also be upgraded further to cause a outrageous amount of damage. Furthermore, the in-game store also offers a chance to purchase speciality themed weapons with ""gears"" that are earned throughout game-play. There are no micro-transactions which make this game stand out even further. Once you've brought the game, you own everything, which means people with a rich daddy can't get an advantage over you this way.

There are currently 8 game-modes available which respective challenges to keep people active on the servers. The aiming system is consistent and easy to get the grasp of, but new players can dive into the campaign levels to help level their tanks quicker and understand the mechanics before diving into multiplayer if they so choose.

Like all games, theres always going to be a group of party-poopers that tend to ruin the game for you. However due to such a large playerbase, you're likely going to meet some pretty rad players too, and you'll be able find more chill groups to play with. The in-game mute button also helps cease the cancer that might be pestering the current game, but you can use it as a tool to identify players before you allow them into your lobby for the next game. Rage-quitters and ""Ruler"" cheaters are always going to exist, so it would be nice in the future for more penalties to exist to combat this issue. Overall though, you're going to make friends whether you like it or not, because most people are pretty chill.


Shellshock Live is constantly changing for the better. Theres always new content, a great xp system, and overall fun people play with. I got it super cheap, but I'd be happy to pay a little more for the amount of fun I've gotten out of it.",Recommended,23,4

This is an EXTREMELY fun party game! I love playing this with friends and the campaign is somewhat interesting as well. You will lose hours playing this game becuase of the past paced matches. There isn't much of a learning curve and higher leveled people aren't too difficult for newer players to beat. The only downside for people may be that you need to have multiple friends in order to get the most out of this game, but luckily I was able to buy this game for many of my friends so it wasn't an issue. I definately recommend this game, ESPECIALLY when it's on sale for $4.19 like when I got it. Even without the sale, however, it's definately worth the money and the experience.",Recommended,16,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The game itself is quite fun, it's like the new and improved ""Scorched Earth"" of the 90's. For more modern references think Worms games from Team17 but without the well, worms. Lots of weapons to choose from albeit a lot of them are just upgrades of the others. Game has a nice campaign mode that can take quite a while, and of course. Multiplayer.

This is where the trouble starts. The community as a whole is rather hostile. In my short time playing I was randomly kicked from 40+ games just from entering and saying nothing, was harrassed numerous times, and saw some people exploiting modes of games to benefit themselves but in essence break the core mechanics of the game. One other thing to note, I did notice that physics seem to be slightly off or rather completely nonsensical in some cases depending on the angle your tank sits at. It's rather insignificant but it bugs me a bit.

In general, great game to buy on SALE, not so much full-price. For those not into these kind of games that are turn-based it's probably a pass, for me i'm glad I got it but I really do hope they work on the community more.",Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 0,0

Oh yes highly recommend this game, it's fun with or without friends.
Challenging singleplayer mode, lots of multiplayer game modes.

There's tons of things to unlock, a ingame currency to even further buy items/weapons etc...
Upgradeable weapons and tank.

Lots of server options.

Its about time I wrote a review on this gut punching game.

Pros:
- If you find yourself good at time based games you will most likely be a god. Shellshock can give you that adrenaline and the feeling of dominance
- Matches are easy if you've figured out the how angle and power works
- Also if you know how to use the different weapons of the game you're set (unless you have a ruler around your screen hot damn)

Cons
- Community is damn toxic at times;
- Teammates often leave when they aren't doing well
- Jerks who wank off at winning
- Devs should really add more weapons and maps
- What the ♥♥♥♥ is the ranking of this game

Notes ???
- MATH IS NEEDED FOR WIND GAMES AND REBOUND
- Tbh when you get into higher levels and like to play team games get good team members
- Usual problems for high lvled players:
- Getting targetted
- Kicked because they're high ranked
- Easiest way to level if your low are point based farms where everyone goes to the mid

Hey guys superwario here. Considering that I have over a 1000 hours I would say I have quite the grasp on the game. First of all, the mechanics for the game are simplistic yet there is so much to discover. With the amount of weapons offered and multiple tiers to each weapon allows for a deep development for the ways to interact with your teammates and enemies. There is also luck based weapons that allow for on-the-edge of the chair moments that can change the tide of the game. Would for sure recommend to anyone who likes strategy based games that can allow development in your tank/character.",Recommended,20,2

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Shellshock Live is a very relaxing game with a frantic assortment of crazy weapons to throw at your opponents. Your mission: shoot stuff at tanks to destroy them. It's literally that - no more, no less. You can shoot with everything - grenades, frogs, fish, sillyballs, MOONS, pooping birds etc.

Gameplay is simple:
At the start of the game you spawn with the set amount of health on a (randomly) chosen map, which can be in different team compositions, 1v1 through 4v4, or 1v7, or a free for all-murder-everyone mode. You get equipped with a set of weapons randomly selected from the ones you have unlocked so far. During your turn, you can select a weapon and a trajectory to damage your opponents. ez life.

It has a level-based system in two separate segments: you can level up to unluck new weapons and perks, and you can level up your weapons by dealing damage with them. You can level up by playing missions, or playing multiplayer games. Your progress depends on your participation (kills/dmg etc, with a bonus for being MVP), the amount of trickshots you hit, and - additionally - you level up for unlocking achievements. With each new level you unlock a new weapon and an ""upgrade gear"" with which you can increase one of your perks (damage boosts, shield boost, mobility boost and.. luck boost).
Leveling up weapons will result in having the possibility to get an upgraded version of the original weapon, which can increase damage, range, area of attack, number of projectiles, or simply the ease to use.

It comes with a bunch of different playmodes and settings to finetune the game to your preference for you and your friends

As an easy to play, laid back multiplayer game it's very suitable to pass time or to hang around with friends (definitely recommended to play with friends; which greatly enhances the joy you can get out of the game). It has a slightly nice balance between luck, skill and silliness, although on higher levels, the weapons you get can often already decide the game.

Pros:
- Entertaining gameplay
- ""Simple yet effective"" graphics
- Nice music and sound effects
- ideal to play with friends
- also suitable for grinding levels/achievements for those that need that to keep them playing
- Your tank can be a beachball. (not really, but it can be round and beachballs are round)
- MOONS
- GUPPIES
- BOUNSPLODE
- Piñata music

Cons:
Only one I can really think of, which can provide quite a drawback: At later levels, the game is frequently already decided by the weapons you get equipped with. There are a few weapons that are vastly more powerful than others, and the higher you get, the more this applies. This effect stacks with your positioning (which you can alter to an extent though, if you upgrade mobility); some weapons only work in close proximity or in certain areas. This goes up to a point where getting poor weapons, or only close-range weapons when in a longrange position, can result in rendering you unable to be efficient at all. While I would not consider winning the main point of the game, it can make quite a dent in your playing experience.

All in all this game is definitely worth it. I've received it as a gift, and have fond memories of playing it. Havent played in a while, both due to lack of time, and because the friends I used to play with rarely play it nowadays (the latter definitely influences me as its much more fun to play with friends). All in all I would definitely recommend!

I used to play games like ShellShock Live on those websites where you can play free games. Like armorgames, maxgames, stupidmonkeygames. But none of them were online multiplayer games. This game really hits the spot of amultiplayer artillery strategy turn-based game.

Players control tanks in a 2D landscape. They aim and shoot the enemy tanks to defeat them with their own in team or free-for-all matches. Shots can be fired after maneuvering its trajectory by adjusting its angle and power. Players up to 8 can play in a match. There are different game modes such as Deathmatch, Points, Assassin, Juggernaut, Rebound, Charge, Marksman and Shoccer. There are 339 weapons that can be obtained by leveling up. The game also offers stat and cosmetic upgrades for player tanks and its maps.

This game is absolutely amazing. The many types of different weapons makes the game much more interesting, as well as the many gamemodes to play on. The system for upgrading weapons is different from much other games, and also much more difficult, making the game harder and also more fun. The tank upgrade system is hard but not impossible once you get to a high level, but by then your weapons will be powerful enough for that to not matter. Overall this is one of my favorite games to play with my friends or just alone and I recommend anyone considering to buy this to stop considering and buy it now! It is very fun and I consider it underpriced, you don't need an incredibly powerful computer to run it, and its very fun to play.",Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 0,1

This game is overall a great game, but there are few flaws in the game.

Pros:

+ Great Graphics
Extreme improvement over the flash versions

+ Great Music
A cycle of calm and intense music with victory music makes the game much more appealing

+ Extreme Number of Weapons
Over 400 weapons to unlock and upgrade to destroy opponents with. More weapons are always in the making. (Although the average time period for new weapons could be better)

+ Addicting
There is a weird glitch making you go back and play over and over again.

+ Play with your Friends
Playing with friends makes the game more enjoyable than with some random jerk

+ 9 Different Game Modes
Be the last one standing in Deathmatch, inflict the most damage in Points, destroy 1 tank at a time in Assassin, steal other's voltage with damage in Charge, attack a ball to score in Shoccer, become the sniper in Marksman, team up or destroy all in Juggernaut, become an expert at imagining segmented parabolas in Vortex, and become the master of trajectories in Rebound.

Cons:

- EXTREME luck factors in game
Random starting weapons, weapons with RNG, one tank gets a close x2 damage, easy to impossible bumpers in Rebound the game is full of RNG. Luck has a good impact on who wins, however the more skilled a player, the higher chance of victory.

- Could be better Community
Many players of this game are toxic, but there are a good handful of players that are fun to play with.

If you aren't sure to buy this game yet, you can check out the flash version (ShellShock Live/ShellShock Live 2) which are both free. The Steam version has much more content, and is instead play to win, not pay to win.",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 1,2

Possibly a review of Worms as a franchise rather than just WMD specifically.

I've enjoyed Worms for a long time, not just for the MP, but mostly the Single Player. Worms is a strategy game that's both simple, and also has absolutely no RPG elements. There's no grinding a unit or worry about how terrible that level up was for Lyn or farming for equipment and hoarding for later missions. Every mission in Worms, is a carefully crafted area to give you a fair but hard trouble (At least, later in the game. They start off jokingly easy of course). The later missions will outnumber you 4 to 12 worms with twice the health, and it's you'll feel great when you outsmart their dumb-but-superaccurate AI.
Worms MP is probably the most popular though, and many people play it as a joke for stupid fun. It's the type of game where when you make a mistake, it's pretty funny how it stacks up. It also has goofy weapons such as a super sheep and even a Grandma. Despite the stupid fun, I equate this game to Smash Bros in terms of ""You play it for stupid fun, but then you'll end up playing it as an esports"". This game has the possibility to be a legit competetive game with the proper ruleset, and Team17 is definitely acknowledging this with their ESL support in WMD.

Worms WMD as an entry in the franchise is great. It goes back to cute 2D graphics with 60fps animations, rather than stupid ugly 3D graphics in a 2D game with 30fps animations. The rope is back to being unrealistic (can rope straight up, fast, hard and not wiggly), large variety of weapons, full length campaign and extra challenges, fully-featured multiplayer.
The surprise is what they added, crafting. At first, ""oh my god why does everything have crafting"", then I realize the genius. This diminishes the RNG of crate drops by being able to craft what you want, but the real improvement? You have something to do on someone elses turn. No more waiting boringly. Speaking of which, this game switches turns fast (I recall an earlier Worms, there's a 10 second wait from when a turn ends and when a turn starts)

Highly recommend this Worms in particular, and the franchise in general.

3578,8,Worms W.M.D,"Posted: 10 August, 2020
I recommend this game, as it is lots of fun, but at the same time there are reasons I would not recommend it. Let me explain.

As a single player it offers a variety of missions and challenges, which can keep you occupied for a while. But competing against A.I. gets boring quickly, because of how predictable (and bad) your computer opponents are, and then you really want to play against other humans. If you’re in a household with other family members or have real life friends to play with, it should be ok. However, if you’re a single guy living alone, like me, you have to venture into the online world to find people to play with.

For many years, I have avoided playing online games on Steam, and here I was once again reminded why I made that conscious decision back then. Now, let me first say that I did meet a bunch of nice people to play with, but, unfortunately, as always, there are a few bad apples that tend to stick out. I was barely 100 online games in, and was already confronted with the most foul language you can imagine, rage quitters, people kicking me from games, just because I won the previous one and certain “top players”, who think they are God’s gift to humanity, just because they are skilled in an online game and don’t shy away from reminding you every 2 minutes of it. These people can really ruin your online experience. If you’re a parent and you allow your child to play this game online, you may want to bear this in mind. I don’t know if these are kids or adults who never grew up emotionally, but I have ZERO TOLERANCE for this kind of behavior, especially the foul language (which goes as far as rape and death threats). I don’t care what your mental disability is, I WILL report you.

Other than that, finding people to play a game with can take a while. At times the lobby is pretty much empty. Of course, this game is already 4 years old, so naturally most people have moved on. But when you do have a game with a bunch of good people, it sure is a lot of fun. Being able to use vehicles, mounted guns, hide in buildings and craft tons of insane weapons is awesome!",Recommended,124,10

Worms. Worms 2. Worms Armageddon. Worms 3D. Worms Forts. Worms: Open Warfare. Have they made enough Worms games yet? More than 20 games exist in the main Worms series, and there's still games like Worms Blast and Worms Crazy Golf that take the physics of the Worms games and apply them to other mechanics.

What improvements were made from, say, Worms 2 (1997) to Worms: Reloaded (2010)? Umm... Worms: Reloaded did have hats. Don't get me wrong, aside from the period where things went off the rails and the Worms games went full 3D, many of the newer installments have been quite good, but they just haven't really added or changed anything worthwhile. I would be perfectly happy playing one of the original games.

Worms W.M.D is literally a game-changer. W.M.D takes the classic 2D Worms formula, and adeptly outfits it with enough new shiny mechanics and enhancements that it's a wonder it wasn't done before.

This installment of Worms adds vehicles: tanks, helicopters, and mechs, etc. Each vehicle has a set of disadvantages and advantages, and they all look and sound amazing. The drillboat is capable of traversing land OR water, which can be extremely useful in certain situations. While you can cause some major destruction inside of these vehicles, don't get caught in a bad spot; it's going to hurt when one of them explodes with you inside. Additionally, the game adds machine guns, flamethrowers, and other stationary weapons around the map for you to use as you crawl around the map. Nothing in this game feels superfluous, and it all has a reason behind it. I've found myself realizing game after game about the sometimes not-so-obvious merits and side effects of the new map elements.

Over the years, I've bought new Worms games and enjoyed them, but frequently found myself disappointed when some of the great classic weapons were removed. I'm proud to report that W.M.D brings back ALL of the best weapons from the series, as far as I'm concerned. Banana Bomb, Concrete Donkey, Super Sheep, Holy Hand Grenade, Sentry Gun, Carpet Bomb - they're all here... and they can be upgraded. In Worms W.M.D, a new crate drop has resources that you can use to craft weapon upgrades, as well as new weapons. This means that you can upgrade your Concrete Donkey to an Angry Concrete Donkey, which falls through the earth covered in FLAMES. The Shotgun can be upgraded into a Training Shotgun, which has laser sights on it. And if you are having a hard time finding the classic Ming Vase, the Dynamite upgrades into it, which makes sense, as having them be separate item slots would be redundant. The Ninja Rope is back again, and the physics are actually shockingly similar to the classic Worms games, which will be a relief for roping veterans.

Maps now will usually have buildings on them if they are enabled. When inside a building, your worms can crawl through their tunnels and seek strategic vantage points. If you don't have any worms inside a building, you can't see any enemies that may be inside. It's very well done, and adds an extra stealth element to the game.

While the game still very much shines as a multiplayer/party game, the single player modes are engaging and exciting. There are many challenges of different sorts for you to complete, and as you complete them you will unlock various goodies, such as new speech banks (accents) for your worms.

The sound effects, particle effects/explosions, and environments are all fantastic and set a new standard for the series, too. Excellent.

Having played MANY of the Worms games in my lifetime, I can confidently say that Worms W.M.D is the best game in the series. It honors the wisdom of the original games by retaining their strengths while innovating in just the right ways. If you have ever found this series even remotely interesting, you need to buy this one.",Recommended,82 people found this review helpful 3,0

Sure, I played Armagmeddon for hours too.
Later when the 3D episodes started I stopped playing it; especially because T17 made you pay for DLC. But with Worms W.M.D I have got a full update to Armageddon.

I don't want to put too much technical detail into this review nor any spoilers.
I love Artillery style games. Worms simply went beyond with its possibilities.

Worms was always hard, that's what makes it whileworthy; I always have the feeling that I could improve any single turn that I make. That's why IMHO the most powerful ability is the Reset Mission button. In W.M.D a mission might easily take you several days to finish it to your satisfaction, especially the later ones (if you don't cheat [a walkthrough is a cheat too ;)]).

Another plus is that once I bought the game, I didn't have to pay for DLC (All-Star-Pack and Forts expansion). Thanks for this Team 17, back to the roots.

In W.M.D I don't miss anything in comparison to Armageddon. Except one thing: I like Armageddon's progressive electronic soundtrack more than W.M.D's mellow easy listening style whatever. But there also might be a workaround for this. [Or maybe Team17 could add some classic or new tracks. ;-)]

All in all: If you like Artillery, get W.M.D. If you like(d) Worms, get W.M.D, if you like Armageddon, then don't throw it in the trash, if you want an unforgetable evening with up to 6 or 8 players (best with friends, or if you ever wanted to banana-bomb the **** out of your little brother or sister or your parents), get W.M.D... and for the funny moments in the game, get W.M.D.",Recommended,65,0

One of the better modern Worms game to date, but is it better then Armagedon ? Well that's always a difficult question as Armagedon holds so much nostalgia for many people, so it's always a given people will say Armagedon is better in every way which is well deserved since Armagedon was the most pure Worms gameplay in the franchise and the peak on how gravity,wind,weapons and general gameplay felt but people kinda wear the Armagedon rose tinted glasses a bit too much and tend to sadly shun changes or additions to the worms formula which is a shame.

So is it better ? Personally for me I'd say it's almost equal to Armagedon because it has a lot of fun new elements while keeping the core formula intact but it does do one thing kinda worse which is subjective and that's the physics for rockets and grenades which seem to have a lot more drop and odd behaviors which i wish it was more armagedon-esk, if the physics behaved more as Armagedon's I'd say WMD is maybe the better game but that's not the case, the physics in WMD aren't bad, they just feel kinda odd at times to me and it's sorta the only major thing i'd say keeping it back.
Now, the new things added into the worms formula via WMD feel like they compliment the game fairly well, such as the addition of vehicles which is something i wanted to see as a kid back in the 90s even, has finally been added to the classic 2D worms gameplay and they're a neat feature that adds a new fun,cool and silly gameplay element to Worms. If it bothers you, you can easilly turn it off in the options, matter of fact all the new additions can be pretty much turned off if you really just want the most basic worms gameplay.

Another addition to the formula is the fact you can now enter buildings, they're no longer just shapes in the terrain used in the environment, if there's a house you can now enter it and peak out of the window to fire which is pretty great and in my opinion a nice step forward for the franchise without going overboard and without damaging the core fun formula.

And one more thing they added is crafting, while waiting for your turn you can dismantle weapons and use crafting materials to craft weapons you need. Got a bannana bomb but want a holy hand granade ? Dismantel it and use the materials to make a holy hand granade. You can also modify existing weapons, such as making the bazooka leave napalm after hiting its target,craft a super flying sheep that farts out gas as it flies,craft a super bannana bomb which you can controll on when it detonates,craft an even more powerfull angry donkey,make your regular grenade into a sticky nade and so on and so on.

The rest of the game is pretty much what you expect from Worms, there's a nice campaign to mess about in with challanges and practices, an online mode that supports up to 6 players with the promise of bots finally being added into online play soon, something which i haven't seen happen in a long time.There's fair amount of cosmetic hats and voice options for worms to make your own team and maps can be easilly made in the similar way as Armagedon and uploaded to the workshop to be quikcly downloaded. There's also an XP leveling system that gives you more cosmetics for completing campaign missions,playing ranked or what most people will be doing which is playing either locally or online with some friends in a party match for fun.

So the only two things i somewhat don't like in Worms W.M.D are the physics for some weapons which feel a bit wonky and the art animation style for the worms doesn't look pleasing to me, everything else in the game looks,feels and sounds great, i especially love how there's now debris flying and bouncing around on the map after an explosion and then dropping into the water which makes it feel more satisfying, the art on the maps also looks good but as i mentioned a bit earlier the art on the actual worms just doesn't look visually appealing to me, for me they look like they were drawn in flash by some newgrounds artist and then animated in that style too, it just kinda looks a tad cheap to me but that's just my personal view on the art style used for the worms.

Overall i think it's a pretty great addition to the worms franchise and i hope it maybe catches on some more and gets improved by the devs since sadly every attempt from Team 17 to have a definitive worms game the community will move into has failed and i think this one has the chance to be that worms game that could bring majority of the small Worms community together in one place instead of having everyone spread about into so many worms games.",Recommended,54,0

If you have never been near a Worms before, all you need to know is that it is a single and multi-player (local + online) turn-based strategy game in which teams of funny little Worms try to murder each other with a vast arsenal of conventional and unconventional weapons, and the destructible background reflects the violence taking place on its surface while adding new layers of possibilities. And failure can be hilarious.

I have fond memories of the Worms series since 1995. There has been a peak in 1999 with Worms Armageddon, and since then it has been a bumpy road that timidly tried new things here and there but never a solid offering with all the features that are expected to be present. The potential of the series was diluted by entries that thought they were trying some new things while constantly dropping the good stuff from the previous episodes. Strangely, overall no real progress was made and more was lost than gained.

Worms W.M.D still has some of these issues. The map specificities (fog, earthquake, gravity) from a few of the previous entries (mostly Worms Open Warfare 2) are lost. The dynamic water weapons from the 2.5D entries are missing too. The funny videos are long lost since Worms 1 and 2. The ability to draw maps did not come back (however, it is now possible to import pictures again). And finally, some details such as deeper customisation and some rope features (length) will not please die-hard Worms Armageddon fans.

Apart from those nit-picks, however, Worms W.M.D is the strongest entry in the series since Worms Armageddon. Most features are there, from the local multiplayer to classic commando missions. The 2D graphics are gorgeous, the Worms re-design is great and the overall feel is more military than goofy. It runs well (apart for the somewhat slow AI), binding new key inputs is possible, and so on. Overall, it is solid. But that’s not enough to set itself apart. So here come the novelties.

Buildings that can be entered. Good hiding places and protection, while putting tunnels back to the heart of the series. Mounted weapons that add a layer of danger. And most excitingly, vehicles! Tanks and mechas, both can jump and are easy to handle. Then helicopters, which end up being a very useful taxi for those players that dominate you and fly back to safety without burning jetpack fuel or having to master the rope. Mmmf, I have mixed feelings about that. Whatever I think of the helicopter, all those additions completely re-write the dynamic of the game. It feels a lot less static for us that are not masters of the ninja rope, and also I think the basic movements, albeit slow, are much smoother than usual since the Worms don’t get stuck just because of a small slope hindering their slimy way. And finally, crafting. I hate crafting, but thankfully it is not obnoxious here. Can be a life-saver to get a new jetpack, or eventually craft a concrete donkey if you have enough parts. Why would you craft anything else? It’s the most reliable.

To conclude, Worms W.M.D is not the perfect game. I will always miss the explosive violence of Worms 1, with its maps and bridges full of mines for chaotic chain reactions. The die-hard Worms Armageddon fans will not have every single feature that they are used to and expect to find. But then Worms W.M.D is better than everything else that the series has recently brought us, with its own novelties that are enough to justify its existence. Good, solid entry, that I hope will be expanded upon rather than dropped in favour of a quick new episode that forgets the good things once again. If it’s your first Worms or if you casually like the Worms series, or if you need to find something new to play with your friends, this new Worms is an easy recommendation, albeit a bit expensive for now.",Recommended,62 people found this review helpful 0,0

Thumbs up for Worms becoming an esport!

Also, easiest drinking game ever:
1 death (of your worms) = 1 shot (of alcohol or milk)

You'll be dead after 3 matches.

The good ol' Worms you know and love with a fresh new look!
The updated graphics (the terrains are especially BEAUTIFUL) really capture the lighthearted fun of Worms (though I was a little suprised they went for the vector style as opposed to cashing in on the current pixel fad, I suppose that makes the game a little more timeless) The controls are as smooth as ever! The new tanks, turrets, choppers, and mechs (oh my!) add an amazing new aspect to this beloved classic. Multiplayer is great with new 1v1 ranked matchmaking. The current DLC (and more to come) really adds to the fun. It truly might be the perfect Worms game, taking all of the great aspects from the old games and adding new features that really are icing on the cake.

Now for my story...
I was raised on Worms, I've played since the Dreamcast days back in '99 (Armageddon) and honestly it is one of my favorite videogame franchises of all time. Worms has always had the amazing ability to satisfy the hardcore and casual gamers alike. I can't count the number of times I've introduced it to people (who have suprisingly never played) and their first impression is always ""This is weird"". But after the first match they are hooked! This feeling for me never gets old, spreading the magic and wonder of Worms and after all these years the lil' guys still got it!
Thanks Team17 for all the memories and for staying true to your roots. I can't wait to see what more is in store for W.M.D.

EDIT: Currently pretty buggy (terrain not loading fully, weapons glitching, lots of crashing on multiplayer, etc) at least for me. Also, multiplayer quickmatch lobby is a little messy- everytime a player enters or leaves it 'unreadies' you so you are constantly hitting the READY button (which is almost a like a game in itself!)

A review from Worms Armageddon veteran.

Another clunky cash grab from Team 17 bloated with unnecessary bells and whistles, while the game itself isn't nearly as smooth and enjoyable as Worms Armageddon.

PROS:
+ Slightly closer to WA in terms of graphics, customizability and game feel than previous entries.
+ Now you technically can play good-old custom game modes like shopper, WxW, rope race (no bow'n'arrow though), doesn't mean it will be as fun and smooth as it used to be.
+ You can customize your team's looks.
+ Runs without slightest hiccups on a modern systems, unlike WA.
+ Proper SteamWorks integration for multiplayer.
+ Big enough single player campaign, because people buy this game to play single player, right?

CONS:
- The game's physics are really bad, everything is too heavy and there are no options to tune it to your liking. Even the ""Low Gravity"" item isn't there anymore. Forget about efficiently roping around, bouncing grenads off terrain for cool skillshots or making something skip on water.
- Weapon category and hotkey layout is a mess. In WA it was like F7+Space+F7 and you're on a rope with parachute selected, ready to traverse the map without worrying that a slight mistake will end your turn. Here parachute is on F2, because... I guess Team17 doesn't want you to have convenient hotkey controls...
- No adjustments for weapon power or rope length, which cripples experience from barely playable classic custom modes.
- The worms are too small. As a result, you have to zoom in too much to see what you're doing and not see the bigger picture and vice-versa.
- The multiplayer is almost dead, even despite the expected influx of new players from the game being included in a recent bundle. What little playerbase it has are kids with little skill and bad manners.
- Importing custom maps isn't as easy and straightforward as it used to be, who needs that huge community-made Worms Map Database anyway? Have a useless Steam Workshop!
- No option to import custom voice-banks, flags, victory tunes or gravestones, the vanilla ones are 'meh', and there are no voice-banks that don't sound squeaky.
- Crafting and vehicles don't add any depth or fun, they just break the balance and add unnecessary complication and confusion.
- Turrets are broken no-brainer OP trash.
- Competitive preset is too limiting, which means that you don't have many tools to diversify your tactics, only your skill at throwing grenades and shooting bazooka matters.
- Team 17 haven't released any updates in months, and probably moved on to making the next low-effort cash grab.

Avoid this game, don't let the devs cash-in on your nostalgia, this game is gravely inferior to WA in everything, except performance on modern PCs and Steam integration. Isn't very fun on its own either, especially with that ridiculous price-tag.",Not Recommended,212,70

game browser is utter ♥♥♥♥♥. it shows both games that you can join and games that are in progess (which you can not join). and for some reason the list keeps refreshing NON-STOP and it is BLOATED. you can't even scroll down to see other games. selecting and joining a certain player's lobby is the only way to play non local multi. there is literally not a single filter option for game browser. you will see a bunch of player names with map names in a list, and no, you are not able to sort the list by region, name, mode, map yadda yadda...

i can just keep goin on, but its a waste of time.

The game is great, really is, BUT...

It refreshes every second, bringing you to the top. Whenever you pick a server, you have milliseconds to double click, or you're just gonna be brought back to the top and try all over again. You think it sounds worse than it is? TRY IT OUT. It's not flawed, it's not bugged, it is COMPLETELY BROKEN, as in: you're not gonna be able to play a single multiplayer game, no matter how patient you are or whatever, it just doesn't work.

Literally, I'm not hyperbolic, please tell me how to play a multiplayer game. Developers of the game, TEAM17, how do I join a server? The ""quick game"" option just brings me to a server where the host is AFK. I've been trying all day, literally ALL DAY, to just join ANY single server WHATSOEVER. It can't be done.

If you're just gonna play for single player or with people physically by your computer, buy the game. It's awesome.

Finally another worms that has the promise of becoming the new worms standard. Over the past few years worms went in a few strange directions that didn't sit well with the now more than 20 year old fanbase. Mechanics were introduced that didn't bring back that old feel, but that has changed. I think this game will reach, or has already reached the level of Worms Reloaded, Worms 2 and maybe even Armageddon. A 2d worms, granted with some new weapons and mechanics that actually fit the theme this time in my opinion. Team 17 finally seems to be listening to the community and have made a roadplan accordingly. Obvious flaws such as no cross platform support whatsoever are being worked on and will be resolved in the near future. The game already has custom maps, and in the near future also custom community made hats!

It probably won't replace Worms Armageddon, which many of us have very fond memories of, but I don't think it has to. This game is certainly worthy being called an actual Worms game.

Worms W.M.D is a tactical 2D turn-based game where you have to make the short lives of other worms miserable with big guns.
The basic concept underlying this umpteenth installment in the series was already conceived in 1995.
Place some worms on an island and give them fat weapons to kill each other. The high dose of humor and crazy weapons, such as the concrete donkey, are not lacking and the recognition is certainly very high for old acquaintances of the series.
In Worms W.M.D you can also walk into buildings or jump into a vehicle.
If you're lucky, a tank, or some other very useful war vehicle, will drop from the sky near you, after which you can dive in to bombard other worms with bombs and missiles.
In addition to the tank, the game includes a helicopter, digger, mech and even a Rocket League car to use.
All in all, this provides an interesting new game element and the already large palette of weapons is expanded even further in this way.



Worms W.M.D is guaranteed to provide you with a lot of fun in the living room and or online!
Playing against your friends feels like old times and even after all the years since the first Worms game, the concept is still up to date.
The additions, such as making weapons and the vehicles, provide some diversity again and the online options also seem to be fine.

Over a 100 hours on record and I would also argue I have hosted the most games of anyone currently still playing the game with 60% winrate. I am here to inform you of the major misopportunity this title is and how the total package on offer here is probably not worth the commitment you will need to make to get the most out of it.

First off heres what I love about the game

PRO +

+Most beautiful worms to date seriously
+Great Maps & Generator
+Hide in Building neat
+Crafting is amazing you won't want to go back
+Giant frickin lazor
+Simple online steam multiplayer
+Overall decent weapon balance
+Turrets & Vechicles are nice option

Here are the major issues that need/should have already been addressed

CON -

-Crashes oh god why still months down the line, Worms has stopped working...
-Awfully annoying unskippable double sound effects at start of the game

-Some weapons round up damage instead of hits! aka the minigun
-They are running tournaments when ranked is dead! why not spend the money on maintaining the health of the game
-Player base is TINY due to zero community support, if it wasnt for steam this game would be 100% dead
-We are SICK to death of watching crates drop, make them just drop instead of float there is NO reason to give them parachutes most players dont know about SPACE bar to make it drop, destroys flow of the fun.
-Zero anti cheat in game you will encounter hackers at some point that make you auto loose before u win...
-Team 17 arent looking for feedback

In conclusion I LOVE worms but there is so much clear evidence that this was a lazy cash grab with barely any support of hardcore players, combine that with a game that is not the most user friendly worms both parties are screwed over and its a hard sell to say that you should get this over Armageddon. Not a single Team 17 employee has contacted hardcore fans with hours of play to ask for much needed patch advice.

Multiplayer near completely dead despite launching just last year. Campaign (why would you bother?) a complete and utter deadloss, featuring AI that can and will perform pixel perfect maneuvers to land on single pixel landscape that you didn't even know was there, or produce a game ending fluky backwards-bazooka shot that manages to send one worm into the air, and knock another into the water.

In addition to all of this, the game somehow manages to fiddle with physics, gameplay and make them leagues worse than the game they released that perfected it nearly twenty years ago. Pretty astounding considering they've been regularly releasing the same game for the last 20 years. The only thing remotely new is the introduction of DLC, a shít crafting mechanism and a few e-celebs.

Buy Worms Armageddon instead. It's a better game, has an actual community and is half the price of this. Not even a cheapo humble bundle (how I stumbled across this) could inject life into this.

Would be good if the online multiplayer component worked properly. The lobby browser is mostly filled with greyed-out games that you are unable to join (either because they are in progress or perhaps don't even exist anymore) and any attempt to scroll through the list to find an open lobby is futile because the page constantly refreshes and sends you to the top for some bizarre reason. To even join a match via lobby browser is a game in itself. The alternative is to use quick match which will find you into the most ""appropriate"" lobby but what you get is a host that is AFK.

Worms W.M.D is the latest installment in Team 17‘s long running artillery strategy series about warring annelids. Due to popular demand, the game’s developer decided to go back to the series’ roots and make a true 2d game, though W.M.D still presents many changes over its predecessors.

The basic gameplay mechanics are the same as they’ve been for two decades. Players command a team of worms (which may be customized with different voice packs, gravestones and visual styles) and must defeat an opposing worm force using a wide variety of wacky weapons. The action still flows perfectly from turn to turn, and drowning enemy worms is as satisfying as it was a decade ago.

Worms W.M.D‘s presentation echoes Worms Armageddon, a game which most longtime fans of the franchise still consider as the best. From the detailed 2d art, to the removal of some controversial features such as classes or water physics, everything screams “your childhood favorite is back!” This doesn’t mean that W.M.D doesn’t try a few new things though. Team 17‘s new game introduces several new concepts to the strategy franchise, with varying degrees of success.

Chief among the game’s new toys is the ability to pilot vehicles and man static weapon emplacements. Worms can now get in the driving seat of tanks, mechs and helicopters, adding some interesting dynamics to the battlefield. Taking command of a helicopter and raining fire from above as the enemy team sits in an oil barrel filled zone never gets old. The static guns also offer new strategic options, as players have to choose between mobility and firepower, and the mounted weapons platforms can be destroyed, dealing damage to their operators when that happens.
The second game-changing addition is the crafting system. Worms can now collect resources (or dismantle old weapons to obtain the bits that make them work) and craft new weaponry, making an already unpredictable game even more chaotic. Enterprising players will rapidly learn that they can actually use the enemy’s turn to craft new gear, a welcome distraction when the opposing commander is laying waste to your troops.

Players can now make use of buildings to shelter themselves from enemy bombardment or prying eyes. Sadly, the execution isn’t as polished as one would desire, and sometimes it’s hard to tell which part of the environment is a building, and which is just part of the map’s decoration (a problem that was already present in Worms: Clan Wars, although that game didn’t feature buildings in the same way as W.M.D)

Worm customization, a hallmark of the series, has been given an incredible amount of detail. There is a leveling system that gradually unlocks more hats, gravestones, voice packs and music, making players feel as if there’s always something new to try out.

The game’s content is as plentiful as the customization options, with a generous amount of singleplayer missions and challenges, and an extensive multiplayer suite. Worms W.M.D also features Steam Workshop support, letting players download new maps created by other gamers with the included level editor.
Worms W.M.D is a successful reimagining of the long running artillery strategy series, mixing Armageddon‘s colorful visuals and tight gameplay with some welcome additions. Team 17 has created a new classic, easily recommended for both newcomers and longtime fans of the franchise.

Every Worms sequel is a few steps up and a few steps down. While new additions like vehicles and combined weapons are fun, it removed some of the fun aspects of last game (clan wars); classes, water physics and workshop intergration for hats and soundbanks.
Because of this, it doesn't feel sequel, but rather an alternative. The search for an ultimate Worms game still continues.

When it comes to dev's roadmap, they have a hard time following it. Half of it didn't make it in the game and they won't communicate what they're planning this year. If you don't have the slightest intention of putting something in the game, don't put it on a roadmap.

If you own Clan Wars and you like that game, there is not much reason to buy Worms W.M.D. If you never played a Worms game, you may like this game, but you could literally buy any Worms game because it hasn't changed much over the last 10 years.",Not Recommended,31,4

Hmm, what to make of Worms WMD. When a new Worms game is released I think ""why should I buy it? I already have several Worms games"". Well, a glowing review from Ben plus the fact it was pretty cheap on special caused me to give it a go. I really wasn't losing out that much buying it, really.

I enjoy it. I pretty much only play single player stuff (campaigns and matches against computer enemies) so my thoughts are obviously regarding that particular aspect of the game. The overall 'feel' of the game is great, the physics and control are spot on, unlike Reloaded, which just felt... off in some indescribable way. The fundamentals the game gets right, and that's a good start.

Having a new Worms game means a wnole new set of single player missions, which as I mentioned above, appeals to me. Giving secondary objectives gives some incentive to replay missions to try to chase full completion of missions, which is something that I'd like to do when I've gotten through them all. There are plenty to get through, so it will certainly keep me busy.

Having access to community maps is a great addition, I've downloaded a heap of maps to play random matches on, and I've enjoyed a lot of them, especially the ones that are recreations of Lemmings maps. They seem to bring out some fun games. For some reason user created speech banks aren't an option, which is very disappointing- it was one thing that was great about Armageddon. I loved my Zapp Brannigan speech bank!

I have at best mixed feelings about crafting. I get where they are coming from, but it injects luck as a factor too much into the game. I wish that the weapons that are available thorugh crafting were available in non-crafting game setups, but sadly that's not the case. It gives me something to do while the other teams are takig their turns (and I think the computer teams were programmed to faff around on purpose to allow time for crafting) but overall I'm pretty meh about it.

I like the addition of vehicles, them plus the turrets you can use add some variety to the gameplay. Their propensity to explode after not a huge amount of damage is done to them is always a factor, just as planning how barrels and mines will behave needs to be planned for when making your move.

I've played Worms 2, WWP and Worms Armageddon extensively.
WMD was an opportunity to create a fun sequel but it disappoints heavily.

=== The good ===
-Vehicles are awesome and bring new ways of fighting each other
-Graphics are great
-UI looks nice
-Airstrikes are awesome
-Many cool new weapons with cool accompanying effects (airplanes, u-boats, etc)
-Ranked matches are awesome

=== The bad ===
-The game plays too slow. The animation times should have been cut in half (waiting for crates to drop down, animation of the concrete donkey, general weapons behavour, the worms themselves). The AI needs to think for 15 seconds before it makes a move. Why is everything so slow?
-None of the popular schemes that people actually play are in the game
-Baseball bat is disabled in the first 3 rounds for unknown reason. Did the CEO get owned once and decided to nerf it? Because it's clearly not coming from player feedback (see below)
-No low gravity
-Particle stutter and lag despite being a 2D game and having a monster PC with a 3090 (even after putting every setting on low)
-You can't change the girder with the arrow keys. Also disabling arrow keys by default. Why would you do that?
-The most pressing issues of its predecessor remain unchanged: buggy and frustating jumping, ninja rope still never does what you want and is even more frustrating, retarded AI despite having had over 10 years to fix it
-The water has become like a calm sea for some reason instead of wild and dangerous looking
-News feed is unclickable
-Aim controls have acceleration which is not helpful especially when time is critical and you want to aim right
-Did we really need crafting mechanics?

=== Summary ===
WMD added a bunch of cool new stuff but at the same time neglected a bunch of critical things which created a half assed sequel. Is Team17 asleep at the wheel? Are they aware of the schemes that people actually play nowadays in the lobbies of Armaggedon? Where is Kaos, Super Sheeper, Mole Shopper, Shopper and many others? They could have made an actual fun revival by looking at what the remaining player base is doing, and they ignored it. You only have to look at the player lobbies for proof.",Not Recommended,101,0

I felt nostalgic for Worms Armageddon, after not playing for over a decade and decided to see what the progress was like on the Worms series over the years.
Came across WMD on sale and decided to give it a shot.

It captures the essence of Armageddon quite well but fails to offer any of the conveniences that made it an enjoyable time sink.



AI
Is it just me or is the AI significantly dumber than I remember?
70% of the time they're dumb as bricks.
25% of the time they work normal and actually hit.
5% of the time they'll pull of some ridiculously accurate shots, like bouncing a grenade off of multiple walls and reflect them perfectly onto the target.



- Typically wastes 20-30 seconds of their turn doing nothing.
- Constantly toggles back and forth between weapon choices.
- Walks to vehicles, enters and then exists, walks away again towards the direction it came from.
- Constantly drops mine/dynamite, takes a couple of steps away and stands around within exploding distance.
- Occasionally they'll fail to calculate an attack, so they'll either keep skipping or just randomly shoot at the terrain in front of them.
- I once ran into a rare scenario where 2 AI worms were left, both were stuck in positions where they couldn't seem to calculate an attack, so they did nothing but skip turn. Walked away for 10 min, still no progress and since there's no way to force a draw/sudden death for the round, I had to exit the match and start all over.




- Love the new maps, buildings, vehicles etc. as It all offers some decent replayability.



- A lack of bridges and a really bad seed system seems to produce consistently boring maps.
- If you occasionally find a good seed, or find one online that produces a detailed, complex map, there's no mechanism to save it in game.
- Even worse, the seed input won't even let you paste the seed, so you have to type it out number by number every time. Fine don't give us a seed manager, but how hard is it to allow us to paste text?
- Map maker and most workshop maps seem useless. I'd rather have a seed manager.





- Love the new crafting system.
- Love the new weapons and customization options.
- Love the scheme management. Allowing me to set up different configurations depending on the game intensity I desire at that moment in time.



All of the reasons below make the game a huge time sink, but not in a good way.

- Cannot disable the replay option in any of the single-player campaign modes, as it's tied to the ""scheme"" (which cannot be modified for campaign) rather than a global option.
- Replay gets triggered extremely easily, usually every turn or other turn. More often as the difficulty progresses.
- As mentioned above, no seed manager. Generating a good map seems impossible at times.
- No way to force sudden death/draw via ESC menu like with Armageddon. If you die early you have no choice but to sit around and watch the AI make stupid decision after stupid decision, turning what should be a couple of rounds into 10+ minutes of your time wasted.



As much as I want to complete the game, I'm really finding myself turned off from WMD because of all the annoyances that force me to waste time doing nothing.
Free time is a resource I don't have, don't make me waste it by watching your dumb AI take 5 rounds to kill a worm with 15 health.

Glad I bought it for $6, as I don't see any long term value in it. Maybe I'll buy Armageddon again.",Not Recommended,20,0

Been playing Worms since Worms 1 on Playstation. This certainly isn't as much of a milestone as Worms 2 or Worms Armageddon but it is still really fun with some new twists added in.

So what does this do you ask? Let me walk through them.

1. Vehicles: There are vehicles allover the map now, ranging from stationary machineguns to helicopters or even the Rocket League Octane car and many more. They all serve different purposes in different situations.

2. Buildings: Similar to Worms 3D you can now enter Buildings and walk around inside it for better cover. Kinda like making yourself a fortress with the burner tool but still different.

3. Crafting: In your weapon menu you now have a second flag for the crafting menu. It lets you combine materials from dismanteled weapons you dont want or materials you collected from crates. Is overall a nice addition to make you get that one weapon you were craving for but these pesky chests won't give you.


That said they seem to have gotten rid of the class system from Worms Revolution. No more heavy, scout, soldier or scientist. At least I havn't encountered them.

Overall a great game and lots of fun!",Recommended,15 people found this review helpful 0,0

Worms W.M.D has hands down successfully managed to topple Worms Armageddon from my personal Worms throne.

After all that 3D b***s***t, Team17 finally went back to the roots and delivered the largest, most fun and absolutely bonkers Worms game in more than a decade.

If you liked worms back in the day, you'll love this.

Pretty much one of the best turn-based / limited time battle royal games of all time, long long before the term Battle Royale was known beyond the confines of Asia, having been birthed by a legendarily trashy film called Battle Royale with Takeshi Kitano. And that conclued the random trivia as well as this review.

I must say that after customising my worm squad, the bouffant brigade, and naming the cast of this unsightly crew after Pulp Fiction characters I was already content with my 30$ purchase. I then played three games with varying weapon combination and map generation to test the new elements, crafting, buildings, vehicles, etc... In conclusion I still have a nostalgia erection 3 hours later, this edition to the Worms franchise should be a staple in everyone's steam library.

A game that very much deserves the mantle of ""Best Worms Game Since Armageddon""! There are a couple of issues I have with the game, such as how a weapon can occasionally bounce in a way it shouldn't for how it's flying and what it's going to hit, and how the game still glitches with indestructible terrain at times. But the weapons are top notch, the crafting mechanic adds a new twist to the game (that can be if that's not your bag of tricks), the game is still getting support a year down the line. And for the Armageddon acrobatics out there, the Ninja Rope mechanics are more fun than before now that Parachutes can be activated at will as opposed to after bumping into a wall, meaning you can fling yourself over ludicrous distances and still land on a dime!",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 0,0

As a big fan and someone who has over 1k hours in Worms Armageddon, I can say that WMD has impressed me. The vehicles and crafting are fun to play with and fairly balanced. The art style is clean and fresh.

There is however some downsides that keep me hanging on to WA, but hopefully will be added in updates.

1.Scheme customizability:
- Can't play mole shopper, theres no mole bomb in this game.
- Can't play hysteria, you can't set turn time to 1 second.
- Can not set mine fuses to random.
- Can't set power of weapons like you can in WA, nor can you let worms spawn with the new craftable weapons if they are an upgraded version. Eg: a worm cant have a ""Cluster Bomb mkII"" at the start of the round because it MUST be crafted.
Overall the scheme customizer and map editor still feels incomplete, but i have hope that T17 will update them.

2.Rope knocking physics: It takes too much force to knock a worm compared to WA in my opinion.

3.MAP EDITOR: Please make a WA map to WMD map converter.. enough said. The current map maker program is not fun to use and has to be run when WMD itself is closed. It would be nice if it were integrated into the game with more features.

4.HP Bars: They disappear... WHY!? sometimes we need to see who the leader is in shopper schemes while we are moving around...

Overall I have had a lot of fun playing basic schemes like intermediate, classic mode and ranked. but for more complex schemes I go back to WA.",Recommended,22 people found this review helpful 0,8

Not as good as Armageddon. Missing modern QoL stuff, missing old sound packs and overall less entertaining.

The stage graphics and environment are good though, but the game play is missing.

Some funny / cool weapons are missing too (like longbow), but in the other hand you get some other cool weapons.

Deserves a lot of patches and changes to actually be a good game tbh.

Basically another Worms game, which remembers one to Armageddon, but which does not reach the same quality and options.

Positive Points:
+ Usable Vehicle like tanks, mechs, helicopters
+ Stationary Weapons like flamethrowers, sniper rifles, mortars
+ good old favorites like concrete donkey and banana bomb
+ build your own weapon by materials you can find in crates or by destroy other weapons

Negative Points (only multiplayer):
- some options from armageddon are missing like configuration of damage and radius of weapons or random timer mines
- no latency information for other players
- desynchronized players
- wrong drawn maps, which cause:
-- stuck worms
-- inaccesible vehicles and weapons
-- terrain is drawn and one thinks one could jump/ walk on it, but there is actually no terrain, so one falls into the water
- relative small player base
- no option to kick afk-player
- list of current hosted games: when you scroll down to find a lobby, the list jumps to top over and over again, so you can't scroll down from time to time
- game seems not to be developed anymore and still has some critical bugs as described above

I can not recommend this game for multiplayer, after I know this. Though it can be fun in roughly one of three matches, but only because of the ""worms-factor"" you may remember from other Worms games.
If you prefer playing in singleplayer this might be still interesting though.",Not Recommended,28 people found this review helpful 3,0

An excellent entry point for newcomers to the Worms franchise, and for long-time fans, an awesome ""spiritual successor"" to Worms Armageddon.

Worms W.M.D. is a triumphant return for Team 17's iconic series, seamlessly blending classic 2D design with innovative features like vehicles and crafting. The game excels in cartoonish 2D conflicts, introducing new elements without losing the original Worms charm. Multiplayer shines with chaotic battles and a vast arsenal of weapons, though the single-player mode falls a bit flat. Worms W.M.D. successfully refines the proven formula, striking a balance between nostalgia and innovation.

It's a must have for Worms fans and I still recommend it for others looking for a fun and rather unique multiplayer experience. Great for LAN parties!",Recommended,16 people found this review helpful 0,0

Having been playing Worms since the days of Worms 2, World Party etc. I've tried to be fair to this game, but it's just a terrible addition to the Worms franchise.
The camera flits all over the place during your turns and ruins quickly chained shots (such as shotgun shots) - especially when firing offscreen.
The vehicles are a fairly mixed bag as to their ease-of-use and usefulness.
The crafting could have added an interesting element to the game, but instead is horrible to use and instead wastes valuable turn time.
Finally, the developers refuse to listen to the community and implement a gamemode where all weapons are available, so you can't just have a good old-fashioned slug-fest using whatever you like.
On top of all this, there's no point in ""competing"" for the World Record scores, as hackers have ruined this mechanic with 0.00 second wins on each of the stages, and Team17 doesn't care about doing anything about it.
The only positive thing I can say for this Worms game over others is the art style. The ""hand-drawn 2D look"" they speak of in the Steam description does look great. The ""best worms experience ever"" line however - so far from the truth.

Overall, highly disappointing. If I could get a refund, I would, but unfortunately I've spent a few hours evaluating it - as all games should be given a decent chance, and this is beyond Steam's refund time limit.

If you've ever heard of Worms you probably know what it is about. Worms never change, defeat the enemy at all cost. WMD is latest in the series wich goes back to its full 2D style with beautiful hand-drawn graphics. It has new weapons and as a totally new thing; vehicles such as the mech, tank and helicopter.

Great game. It's like a modernized Worms Armageddon. The turrets, crafting, and vehicles were a bit concerning to me as I'm sure they were to a lot of veterans, but they are incorporated wonderfully and fit in well.

The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish there was more single player content. There are a decent handful of really cool single player missions, and there are a lot of training missions as well. But, once you're done with all of that, the only thing to really do offline is make yourself interesting matches against bots.

Basically, Worms Armageddon with simple and fun crafting, cool vehicles and building interiors.

The Super Sheep training was too simple though :P

- - - -

Edited from my answer in the comments:

It's a lot like it [Worms Armageddon] to me.

The balance is different on weapons, weapon speed, gravity, jump height, fall damage (and fall threshold), but it ultimately feels a lot like Armageddon.
Most of the iconic weapons act really close to their Armageddon counterpart, like the Super Sheep, the Ming Vase or even the worm selection thing.

It feels like a sequel, with the addition of vehicles and crafting: taking base features and expanding upon them.
Vehicles add more liberty, more movement, and specific strategies. Crafting allows for less wait time between turns and make the crates more crucial.

Even the UI feels really close, with the wind display, health bars, fonts...

And finally, singleplayer features feel a lot like Armageddon: training (Super Sheep training \o/), missions as a campaign, the team editor with its iconic voices. I miss the map painting editor though!

There are a lot of differences, obviously, but it really feels like Team 17 went back to Armageddon and expanded upon it.",Recommended,19 people found this review helpful 0,2

Used to play world party with my brother way back in the day. Bought this thinking I'd get a bit of nostalgia and fun party game action. Honestly, I feel like this game doesn't really offer much more than the game I knew way back when. Playing this now it just feels kind of clunky, it takes too long, I don't like the crafting elements (partly because it just adds extra minutes to what I consider a quick part type game, sort of going against the core design IMO) I don't like vehicles they seem unnecessary and overpowered. Absolutely hated the camera, seems to lock on to things that are not actually where the action is happening, it’s too zoomed out, it’s too slow to move etc. something about the camera in this game really bothers me, it just never seems to be where or how I want it to be. It’s not all bad however, the graphics are simple and clean. It can be a fun game to mess around with friends. I like the customization options. IMO the main thing the game failed on, is simply they should have been busy polishing what they had already design wise. Just adding a massive number of fun weapons to the arsenal and just make sure everything runs smoothly and effectively. Instead I feel like I got about the same number of weapons as entries that are years old, and some clunkiness to the game that seems present now.",Not Recommended,32,0

Great fresh look to the roots of the Worms franchise. The new weapons and the crafting system add something fresh to the game and makes the game somewhat more suitable for online multiplayer. Rather than a hot seat game of ""beat your friends in the game or beat them with your fists afterwards"" style that would prevail some 15 years ago. But such thing is still possible with the game.

The game mechanics are very similar to those of Worms: Armageddon. Both in terms of gameplay and a variety of scheme settings. The best new thing are buildings which are fun to use and can play vital part in a match. The vehicles are also interesting to see in the game although a lucky vehicle spawn can quickly turn tables in a match.

As someone who fell in love with Worms games at first sight, which was sometime around 2001 or 2002, I'm glad that this game came out and has a dedicated dev team to take care of the game and keep adding new themes and weapons. I paid the full price for the game and it's worth every penny. If you see the game on sale, it's an absolute must have!",Recommended,15,2

Pros:
+ It's almost as good as Classic Worms Armageddon. Even better in some aspects.
+ Works perfectly on modern Windows & Linux systems (!), supports 4K.

Before I begin the review I just want to say that I am not interested in the multiplayer experience, so anything related to multiplayer including the issues others are having are excluded from this review. I am only interested in the single player content, so that's what this review is about.

To begin, I remember playing Worms for the first time way back in the day, and I always loved this game. Worms always reminded me of a game called Tank Wars which was the first game with similar physics that I have ever played. I really enjoyed Tank Wars, so I was already hooked to Worms.

In regards to Warms W.M.D, I think this is the best version of Worms yet! The game runs smooth for me, their is a large variety of weapons to choose from, there are now vehicles and turrets that you can use, and you can even craft new weapons in the game!

The 2d artwork is great at suits the game well, much better than the 3d graphics. There plenty of different terrain and building types, and the random map generator offers a lot of flexibility when creating a variety of different maps to play on.

The customization is great. You get to name you worms, setup their outfits, voice, tombstone, etc. You can also customize the weapons, game related parameters, etc.

One thing I really like about Worms W.M.D is the large selection of different game modes. You got training, campaign missions, extra missions, bonus content, etc. You can also create a custom game where you can setup teams including alliances. I really love alliances! I create a team of my own worms and then I ally myself with an AI team which I created vs another AI team. It's a lot of fun working with you AI friends to defeat your AI enemies! Who needs multiplayer when you got AI friends to play with! The AI is pretty decent too. To be honest, the AI is doing better than me, lol!

Anyways, I totally recommend Worms W.M.D to anyone who likes these kinds of games. It's a fun game, it has lots of replayability, and you can play the game with your custom created AI friends! Again, who needs friends, when you got AI friends! Their such great friends, better than some of my friends in real life! So, go on, go for it, pick this game up, and have some fun!",Recommended,11,0

But I can't recommend this game when such basic bugs are still present after game being released 4 years ago. Same with other Worms games, they publish a game and very quickly drop support and move to another one. I still play this game sometimes, but it's love mixed with hate.

It's bit baffling that this game feels exactly like Worms 2 back in the day when played it with friend shoulder to shoulder at 90's, there hasn't been almost any kind of upgrade in gameplay. Targeting with mouse and over all better controlling and not misusing your armament would have been welcome change over years.

Well there still is new ""wormable machines"" which worms can control and wreak havoc among their enemies. They feel pretty necessary due how campaign and missions are built and pretty much always enemy team has good lot of worms while yours has only 1-3 most of the time. Combat missions are pretty neat to play, but the challenge ones are usually quite tedious and precise to do.

Other new thing to me is weapon crafting in which you can scrap old weapons to make some new with materials. Basically all major weaponry will be left to be experienced in other game modes than campaign and similar missions, but then again playing local co-iop with controller was pretty bad and it felt like it wasn't any way updated to these days standards. Only one controller was usable and that means you can't craft while friends turn is going on, usually you are able to craft on own and AI's turn.

So overall felt like had plenty of negatives to say about W.M.D., but still really liked playing it and enjoyed good lot of those played hours, but still could be different if last title would be much more recent one and seeing how little has been improved in 20 years is truly quite baffling.",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 1,0

Definitely the best worms title release since Reloaded. They have taken away a few weapons which I miss, but that is not an issue in the long run.

They've added buildings which you can ""hide"" inside now, which is nice. Vehicles are also a new addition, and they are not too OP, despite what your initial thoughts may be. Everybody loves the helicopter, of course. Weapon crafting is also in the game now, and its great. Every turn, you can dismantle weapons to get resources, which you can then craft into new weapons on subsequent turns.

As for the gameplay, it feels good overall. Shot power and and wind effects seem well done. It is still possible to do some trick shots with grenades, though I find their bounciness seems a little extreme.

Customization is also plentifull. Lots of options to make your worm team unique.

Multiplayer can be a little sparse at times, so your best bet would be to get a few friends to buy in. Weekends are a little easier to find games.

Overall, this is a good return to its roots for the Worms franchise. I personally love artillery style games, and think everyone should give this one a shot. (See what I did there?)

Finally, a good Worms game after so many disappointments! The controls are very responsive, the physics feel good and are very consistent, customization is extensive, the game is surprisingly atmospheric, and it sure as hell is fun! It has some massive improvements over other titles in the series, such as 8 worm teams, larger maps and (at last) a good launch. The vehicles are (to my surprise) balanced, as is everything else, including the pre-order content, and it runs flawlessly. The game is gorgeous, the sound is excellent, (it honestly has some of the best mixing I've ever heard) and the slightly more 'gritty' feel this game has compared to the previous Worms titles makes this entry into the series stand out from the crappy consolised Worms games of the past decade.
And as for a comparison with Worms: Armageddon? The game's different enough that it justifies a purchase of both.
My only complaints really are that some of the hats and soundbanks are locked behind a level system, and the slight indroduction of luck-based gameplay within the crafting system. Other than that, this is easily the best Worms game since Worms World Party, and I honestly think with a bit of support from Team17, which they have shown they are willing to give, this could be the best Worms game yet.

Good job Team17! Recommended.",Recommended,24,0

Worms W.M.D is more Wormage.

its a stepback to what worked in the 2d space.
and the added new features are welcome additions but can be turned off if you want a more classic gaming experience..

The game is solid has a well developed style i could wish for more variations in landscape themes but what is there works and is great fun.

with Workshop support for customized landscapes.. it can continue to have countless levels you can download.

most of the new features are fun and doesn't interrupt but gives more uncertainty to matches and creates more depth to a already well established franchise...

First off, this is a very fun game.

But I can't in good faith recommend this game to anyone. ""Full Controller Support"" is a blatant lie and the QA department did not test this out very much, if at all. Input issues have been prevalent since launch, and many PC review outlets have documented this. I personally can't use the keyboard; it simply won't work, so I have to use a controller. My friend can't use any controllers (360, Xbox One, or keyboard/mouse), and Team17's support basically told him that he should revert back to Windows 7 because they're able to enjoy the game from their own rigs. The developers delete posts on Steam from consumers (like me and my friend) that complain about the lack of updates on input issues that have persisted through patches.

To me, that says all one needs to know about the state of this game. It was rushed and has game-breaking bugs that are currently either being ignored by the developers, or they don't know how to fix them so they're just deleting flame posts to cover their products' reputation. I really hadn't played much Worms since Dreamcast and only really got this game to play with my buddy, but he had to refund the game as support was non-existent.",Not Recommended,21,4

Save your money. There's very few people who actually play this online and the ones who do are the same two or three who are at the top of the ranked leaderboard and you'll likely get beat. I can't imagine how long these few players must sit waiting for a ranked match because they are literally the only 3 players I've encountered online.

To put this into perspective you start out at a very low rank, so I expected to play against people my own rank (ya know new players?). Nope, I get these guys, top rank you can acheive, top of the leaderboard. Difficult to get excited or want to continue playing when its the same players who have obviously gotten very good at this and playing them feels like trying to beat a professional [INSERT CHOSEN SPORT] player when you're a regular person who casually plays sports.

The singleplayer isn't anything to shout home about either so unless you have a friend to play this with don't bother but then again I'm sure the other worms games are just as good if you already have them. Or you know if you're a sadist and want to make friends with the French guy, Russian guy and Spanish guy (I think?) then go for it...but yeah you can't chat during a game either..so just enjoy getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trounced by a team of worms screaming ""OMELETTE DU FROMAGE"".",Not Recommended,43,3

A great couch co-op game. Not the best worms game.

Pros:
- Sheep on a rope, just wow
- Weapon crafting is very cool
- Worms have never looked so good

Cons:
- Maybe this is nitpicking but I loved the awards after a round, now each player gets one award so no more worm of the round or cockroach awards etc..
- Vehicles aren't great. It's cool seeing Team 17 bringing fresh things to the game but helicopers are basically unlimited jetpacks since you can enter and exit vehicles as many times as you want per round, even after a shot.

Worms W.M.D is probably one of the best 2D games you'll ever see in this gaming era!!

From the creators of it's predecesor games, such as Worms Armageddon (1999) and Worms Reloaded (2011), here comes the Wormage that you've never seen before!

PROS
Based upon the old engine - Worms W.M.D was focused upon it's predecesor's game mechanics. If you're one of the players who tried Worms games before, then you'll adapt the gameplay quite easily.

Graphics - It brought tears to my eyes when I noticed that everything... Was hand-drawn. This just proves the fact that games can be Art! It took me awhile to even locate myself from how beautiful and detailed the landscape actually is.

Vehicles - The mind-blown thing since the Teaser Trailer was the Tank, right? Well, a quick spoiler. There are Tanks. And Helicopters. AND Mechs (And Octane Battle-Car) for you to control the tide of battlefield!

Mounted Guns - Machine gun, Flamethower, Mortar, Sniper Rifle. The only weapons deployable in the Landscape. Use them wisely!












This game easily became one of my favorite games of all times! Recommending this to EVERYONE! Fall in, Maggots!!!

In my memory, Worms Armageddon was the first videogame I ever consciously played, so it makes me extremely happy to know that Team17 is still pushing strong and not disappointing with new entries, like Worms W.M.D.

The simplicity of the game and given that the concept has been in practice for over 2 decades, almost 3 at this point, makes it so this entry is terribly well polished. I couldn't find a single glitch or bug in the game and every part of the game felt like the original Armageddon, but newer.

More weapons, more voices, more customization, more tools, crafting system, lots of single player content, etc.

If you like a good turn-based artillery game, I can't recommend this game enough.

As someone who grew up playing the Worms series, diving into Worms W.M.D was like reuniting with an old friend. This game flawlessly recaptures the quirky charm and tactical fun of the original titles, while infusing it with modern enhancements that elevate the experience.

Firstly, the gameplay remains true to the series' roots – a chaotic blend of strategy and humor. The addition of new weapons and vehicles brings a fresh layer of strategy without overcomplicating the classic formula. There's something incredibly satisfying about orchestrating a perfectly timed bazooka shot or a devious ninja rope maneuver.

The art style is a beautiful homage to the original, maintaining the cartoonish appeal but with crisper, more vibrant visuals. Every explosion, every wacky weapon effect, feels like a celebration of the game's legacy. The sound design, from the iconic worms' voices to the satisfying booms, contributes to an immersive and entertaining environment.

Multiplayer is where Worms W.M.D truly shines. The laughs, the rivalry, and the unpredictability of each match make it an ideal game for friends and family. Whether it's a friendly bout or a competitive clash, each session is a rollercoaster of emotions, from triumphant joy to comedic despair.

Perhaps what's most impressive is how the game balances accessibility with depth. Newcomers can jump in and quickly grasp the basics, while veteran players will appreciate the subtle nuances and strategies that can turn the tide of battle.

In conclusion, Worms W.M.D is a masterful continuation of a beloved series. It preserves the heart and soul of Worms while introducing enough new elements to feel fresh and exciting. This game is not just a trip down memory lane; it's a reminder of why we fell in love with the Worms universe in the first place. It's a blast (literally) for gamers of all ages and a testament to the timeless appeal of good, old-fashioned fun.

Everyone is giving this a very positive review, sadly i'm going to be one to give it a negative one.

This review is coming form a person who loved Clan Wars and loved Revolution even more (i have a playtime of 350 hours between those two). I really liked the water physics and the roping system in those games. I enjoyed how i could play around turrets by flying fast or making them role down hills. I also liked worms customisations that made an inpact on how you played the game (i'm talking about the classes)

Me and my friends played this game with strategy - always thinking about where to put worms just so would not be knocked out, we found out a lot of ways to play around turrets and avoid being washed off of a cliff.

All of these things have sadly not been added to this game. This game is by no means bad - it's fun and enjoyable but i feel like the depth and some of the tactical skill needed to play has been removed.

Also it costs 30 euros... that's a bit steep for a Worms game.

In conclusion:
I would recomend this game for anyone who enjoyed the old classic worms titles. It's a fun party game that most people would enjoy.
I would not recomend this game for people who enjoyed the mechanics and depth that Revolution offered because most of those have been removed. (i know that this group is probably smaller but it's still nice to get my voice out there)

For you who are used to Revolution, this game does not have different sizes of worms and the physics are more wonky regarding ninja ropes and such, so it feels quite different from Revolution.

Worms W.M.D is a 2D artillery turn-based tactics game that can be played with 5 other players local or online where you need to strategize well in order to survive and kill all enemy worms. I am honestly not sure if I should recommend or not recommend this game because there are things that I liked, and things that I did not like.
PROS:
+ The idea of the game itself is good. You need to combine smart tactics, fine platforming, and good aiming skills in order to beat your opponents.
+ The graphics are quite nice, and there was a lot of details put into them. Map generation is also quite good.
+ Large variety of weapons and craftable weapons that makes the game more interesting.
CONS:
- I know that you are playing with worms, but, the game is too slow-paced. Worms themselves are very slow. Time between turns is long. Crates dropping takes an eternity as well.
- The game can get frustrating at some times, especially when you use the rope, or when you get stuck in remaining pixels of the map, or when your jump does not want to reach the other side.
- Multiplayer is quite dead. You get re-queued to AFK lobbies every time. I think I would have had more fun playing it with friends instead of single-player and multi-player with randoms.

Excellent party game with friends, loving the art style. Like using the editor to make my own assets, wish the editor was a little bit more developed in a few respects. Lack of custom speechbanks + gravestones holding back what could otherwise have been an infinitely customizable experience (but you can make hats and maps!). Crafting system is fun, and optional. Physics are goofy, nonsensical, and perfect, vehicles and turrets are a little wonky but it really just adds to the party game experience, which is what Worms has always been at its core.

The 30$ USD pricetag is certainly contentious but it's good to remember that this game actually got a physical release for the Switch, and as per Steam's store policy, a publisher using Steam to sell their game must match their pricepoint across the market. Game goes on sale regularly too (go steam), pick it up then!

To start, the graphics are much better in 2D than the ugly 3D of the previous entries before it. Vehicles add so much to the game and are a blast to play with. Buildings and crafting add even more strategy to the gameplay making it much more rewarding. The game is best played with friends in the robust multiplayer mode as the single player mode gets old fast.

Probably the only review I'm ever going to make on steam:

Dear Mr/Mrs Developer/s,

I want to thank you for creating the most under(rat)ed game on the platform we call Steam. Not going to lie, my friend gifted me this game as a joke when none of us knew what it was; but jokes on us because it has been fun through every single second of it, and continues to be. Some days we play it to practice our aim for other games, such as CS:GO (R.I.P that game since it became free) and Rainbow Six, while other days we play it to have fun and unwind.

This game, , has so much more potential than what it currently is at (even though it is already good). Whoever developed this game should seriously make an update to it because it can become something much more significant than what it is right now. It's a real shame to see not many people playing this game (an uncommon sight to see people playing on a server), but there still is a community.

I urge you to make an update to this game. You would make me the happiest man on the planet :)) Until then, I'll continue to spread the word to others about this game.

Kind Regards,

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
A fast paced FPS heavily influenced by Quake and it's Rail gun. Highly recommend checking it out if you you're a fan of arena shooters.

I was baffled the first time I saw what Q2 and Q3 pro players used to do. For the purpose of seeing their opponents more clearly, they were stripping textures of the walls and models in the game, leaving the game with solid color objects which helped them aim better, reduce lag and so on. The same kind of 'design' is what attracted me to Ratz Instagib, beside that Instagib word in the title.

For those unaware, Instagib is popular FPS mode that originated in Quake 2 and was popularized by Unreal Tournament. It has only one rule - one shot, one kill. It means there are no additional powerups, shields, health pickups. If you miss your shot, good opponent will make you die instantly. Instagib is basically mode-for-all - you can snipe or rush, whatever you find suiting, with weapon that's reminiscent of Quake's Railgun and UT's Plasma Rifle.

Ratz Instagib is gaming title completely dedicated to Instagib where you take on a role of cute little rat you can customize with random items that drop after the game in various well known modes such as duel (one on one), deathmatch (free for all), team deathmatch (you probably get it), CTF (capture the flag) and freezetag (the same game we've used to play as kids, but in the streets).

Game consists of 13 official maps and heck a lot of unofficial maps. Official maps are very well designed, although there should be some pointer about number of players because some maps are way too cramped for 5+ players. Unofficial maps are... well, it's hit or miss really. Some that I've played are pretty good, while others are seriously horrible. There's really handy and easy to understand map editor available in the game which you can use to create your own maps. I think Ratz Editor is probably the easiest map editor I've come across in all my years of gaming.

An important aspect of every FPS is movement. In Ratz, it's really fluid, and you can change direction at any point suprising your enemies and delivering vengeance after their miss. I had immense fun bunny hopping and circle jumping properly for the first time. I never did it properly in Quake and that made me dead meat in every single match. Ratz is really simplified and works wonders even for the first time players. Additional way to control your player is quasi rocket jump you can use to boost yourself to higher ground in the game.

This is a game of skill - it means you will probably meet a bunch of veterans in the game already, but don't be discouraged - after two hours of play your eyes will already register the movement of Ratz stars and your fingers will try to emulate. All of a sudden, you will be climbing the ladder and ending your matches fourth, third, second and even as a winner. Ratz Instagib succeds where most FPS multiplayer games fail: you can have fun both winning and losing in this game. One of my matches, a two on two team deathmatch ended with my team winning 80-79. Those were ten most intense moments of my day.

There really isn't anything negative to be said about Ratz Instagib, but two fair warnings must be given out. First, game is using color scheme which will make your eyes bleed at one point, so taking a break is something you should do every match or two. Good thing is you can easily change color of enemy models, even in the middle of the match so you can see them better. Secondly, player base is really not that big, that's why I am afraid to recommend Ratz Instagib at its full price, although it's completely worth it. However, at current discount price (the first and lowest I've ever seen) of 0.79 €/$, it's a steal, and people should be beaten for not purchasing it right now. Currently, on European server that I use to play, I had full TDM and DM matches and you can always arrange a duel with players via online chat. Unfortunately, matches like Capture The Flag are harder to organize, it's probably wise to ask for people to play in community forums and add them to your friends list.

Ratz Instagib is intense, completely skill-based simplified shooter that brings back the glorious days of solid color textures aiming to drain your eyes dry and present you with Carpal tunnel syndrome. Damn good time, I have to say.

I can't remember when I had more fun with the game I've purchased after selling few Steam trading cards on the market.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
pros:
- 1minute to download
- Extremely addictive
- Very skilled (similar to first Quake: fast, accurate, bunnyhopping)
- There are some skins but not too many cosmetics overall in order not to distract too much from the gameplay
- Soundtrack (gorgeous jazzy-DnB)
- Even playing with 600 ping your game will feel super smooth


- lack players sadly
- workshop with maps from the community could help the game to grow


It may be my new favorite game, i would recommend any fan of old-school fast-paced FPS (Quake style) to buy it without a doubt!",Recommended,48,4

The game is pretty dead but I love it to death. you can find a lobby or two during peak hours but you can expect to see the same small community again and again if you choose to play. Finding a full lobby puts a grin on my face from ear to ear.

the mobility is pristine. you move significantly faster if you keep jumping. you can rocket jump with right click but it doesn't do damage and you don't take fall damage. so you just bounce around clicking on people at full speed and if you click them then they die. beautiful graphics. wonderful soundtrack. if you like playing first-person shooters with your friends then buy the four pack for you and your mates when it's on sale. this game is $0.89 and $2.49 for the four pack on the steam winter sale when I wrote this. totally worth it.",Recommended,32 people found this review helpful 0,2

Triple Monitor Unknown
Framerate Cap 120-144+
FOV Yes, 2 Sliders
Key Rebinding Full
Controller Support/Rebinding No

PC Port Quality

The options are extremely extensive. You can map all of the controls including toggle/hold zooming. You have two separate FOV sliders for general and while zooming (up to 160 degrees) and separate mouse sensitivities for each and separate x/y axis adjustment, and y invert. You can toggle almost all of the visual effects like bloom/vignette, as well as outlines for players and objects. You can control the the color/style of everything from the crosshair, to your in-game name, the enemy and team colors, two level saturation sliders, etc. It has auto contract color picking, and the only thing better I'd like would be per-level enemy color selection. I use a red-pink, and I have to manually switch them to a green or cyan for the red/black level. You can turn off hit decals, force the default beam and death animation for enemies, hide/move the weapon model. It's a ridiculous amount of customization, and it runs great too. It doesn't have a dedicated fullscreen mode, and while that sucks, it's an issue that all Unity devs have to deal with. It starts up, loads, and closes very quickly, and the menus work very well, making mid-match changes very doable.


It's by far the fastest game I've ever played, and it feels extremely good. I found the zoom function unusable at first because of the static sensitivity, but then I found the sensitivity scaling slider, and it works great. The players are pretty small objects in the environment, so extremely long ranges happen frequently, but the movement is extremely fast and close range engagements happen often so you need a higher sensitivity to do well. So having the zoom and essentially two separate sensitivities, really helps. The sliders are numerical, so you should be able to keep the mouse to screen distance ratio the same at both FOV values, with a little math. I do wish you could disable the death animations of your own player, as certain ones can shoot the camera across the map and I don't find it very appealing.

The game is rather limited in terms of modes and maps, though a map editor was just announced and one would assume that comes with workshop support. That's good for the future, but at the moment it feels limited. The gameplay is so satisfying if you have a knack for it, but I did have a problem. I played for 2 days without issue, nothing feeling unfair at all, but all of a sudden on the third day, it because quite inconsistent. The player count was at 1600+, vs the ~700 of the two days prior. It could be my connection, and though my ping was only ~30, the game got drastically less fun. The boost (rocket jump) function is essential for quick acceleration which makes you a hard target, but if it outright fails to activate 15% of the time, you die because you stay in place when you should have shot off in another direction. It was much harder to see this, but there were also instances of shots missing randomly at all sorts of ranges. The game was updated without patch notes before I played the 3rd day. I had zero issues in this respect for about 4 hours of play across the two days prior. It could be my connection, it could be the update, it could be the servers, but whatever it is made me not want to play when I loved it the days before. It's so dependent on that speed and responsiveness, that if anything takes it away, the fun is gone.

There are two things to unlock in the game. One I'm fine with, while the other is problematic. The beam shape and death animations are unlocked via by getting achievements tied to killstreaks, the highest being 3 Monsterkills, which I believe is 6 in a row (not just without dying, but in very quick succession as well). Some of the others are tied to winning x number of the various match types. I mean I'd strive for zero unlocks at all, but these are harmless. Next is customization items for your character, that are given via a random drop system. Thankfully there are no microtransactions tied to it, but I still really do not see the point of it. It limits player choice and expression right out of the gate, and it just gets stupid people to blow $80 on some half-assed textureless 3D model on the steam marketplace. The game is so old-school and consumer oriented in every other aspect, that this one system contrasts immensely in what is a paid title. Better this than microtransactions, but it's needless regardless.


I think the rats are unappealing, and I'd like to toggle off the death animations and gore effects, but the levels and overall visuals are nice. The menus are very basic but work without issue. The levels almost all look straight out of Mirror's Edge and I really like them. I'd love to view them in full color, but the advantages of having the level saturation <~30% are too much to give up when really trying to do well. I will say though that if per-level enemy color and saturation settings were an option, that would be amazing. If you want the most advantage the way it is now, the best option is to go with low saturation, unless you want to manually adjust it before every round.


At it's best, I love this game. It feels amazing and nailing awesome shots or streaking is hugely satisfying. That said I would be wary for multiple reasons. If connection problems occur, the fun goes out the window because of the insane skill requirement. I also play on a 120Hz display with ultra-low motion blur enabled, and I'm not sure how well it would really fare without that, again because of the insane speed of everything. Finally, player count could be a real issue at some point. For months before the Free Weekend that's occurring as I write this, the game had less than 20 players. And because of the price it's offered at, I'm not sure how many players will actually buy the game and continue playing after the promotion. It has no single-player content, so unless you have a friend to 1v1 against, you're boned if no one else is online. The game has a 1v1 mode vs a random player, but a tiny pool of players means the ranking system can't really do it's job well and you'll be matched with the same insane player endlessly. I'd more than recommend it on a very cheap sale or bundle because that's sure to bring in some players for a while and the low price means even if you can only play for that week, it's not as much of a let-down as it could be at a more substantial price point. But that's up to the buyer, as some expect an hour of fun for their dollar, while others might want five to ten which is very achievable in the current market. It could use some small tweaks, but most of all I just think it needs a consistent playerbase. It's still early access, so an official release plus an even more substantial sale could very well make that happen. Because of the intensity and limited maps/modes for now it's not really something suited to binge-play, but it's something I could easily see hopping on every day or two for 30 mins to an hour if that was an option.",Recommended,38,3

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I use to play this a long time ago when it was a browser game on kongregate.com. The first time I played it, I knew it had potential.

The game is exactly what it says - you're a bunch of rats hopping around playing instagib. There's free-for-all, Team deathmatch, freeze tag, capture the flag, duel and even a little survival mode to mess around on, all using only railguns. The movement feels very smooth. There's railjumping, and bunny hopping is a lot of fun (and the key to success).

Another thing I feel compelled to mention is the customization in this game. You can almost edit everything from simple graphics options like toggling Bloom and cell-shading on/off, to wall and/or prop saturation, FOV, HUD, enemy colors, your rail color, death animation/fx, and your rat itself with cosmetics. The music plays like a little radio in the corner and you can hit pause to change it at any time you want. The music kind of has that late 90's feel, reminds me of the Dreamcast days. It's awesome.

The game has a lot of maps for an Early Access game and is getting great support from it's lone developer who is active on the forums listening to suggestions and squashing new bugs rather fast, which is always great. I'm impressed with how far this game has gone and I can definitely suggest this game, especially to those who loved playing instagib mods back in the day.",Recommended,26,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
What can I say about Ratz Instagib? Well it is a railgun, instagib multiplayer shooter which incorporates the rocket-jumping mechanic familiar to Quake and Team Fortress 2.

The game is surprisingly simplistic; move around and shoot, however a combination of rocket-jumping and the 1-hit-kill railgun create an intense, competitive environment where timing and precision is your key to success.

Not only does Ratz bring back great memories of Quake II railgun battles and Unreal Tournament's instagib mode, it has its own merits—primarily the level of customization which creates a very level playing field and a very personal experience—you are free to individualise almost all aspects of the game from the colour of your railgun beam to the colour of your name, team mates and enemies.

The newly introduced item drop system is purely based around cosmetics which maintains the balance and integrity of the game.

Game-modes include Team/One man army Deathmatch, Freeze Tag, CTF mode and most likely more to be introduced in future updates.

Updates seem to be introduced on a relatively frequent basis but at this point, the game looks very much like a finished product:




These features successfully disguise the fact that it is an early access game and are the reasons why I highly recommend Ratz Instagib!!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unlike what I normally do, I won't just put a couple of lines for comedy and call it a review,
This'll be a review with ""hardly"" any comedy.

So, Lets get started with this, you're a rat with a deadly laser pointer that blinds people and obliterates them, who can also jump 2 metres in the air with help from it's TF2 soldier powers and stands on it's hind legs.
From that, All I can say, It's better and deviats from the normal theme of bad guys, Good guys, Soldier, Shoot shoot guns.
So yeah, Basically buy this game.

Now, Onto the drawn out bit;
Pros;
-Good movement capabilites
-Weird idea, But it's fun
-Very colourful
-Great art style
-There's an option for anything, From colour of your enemies, To every character of your name, Even your laser.
-Mutli player is fun
-The community is nice... Well... Out of the 10 people who play on the euro servers (we'll get too that)
-Brilliant for practicing hand eye co-ordination and improving reflexes
-Unlockables (Basically like hats and weapons in TF2 and CSGO)
-Good clean maps
-Very open

Cons;
-The SMALL community, This game needs more players, Many people will be put off with the fact, You'll spend 5 minutes looking for 1 game of deathmatch.
-The game puts you into games with higher skill groups if there is not enough players
-If you're coming from source games, The sensitivty is NOT the same, Be careful took me 1 hour just to find the perfect sensitivity, If you're stuck trying to find it if you play source games, Just half what you normally play on, Should work.
-Needs more maps, Once you play all the maps, It gets repetative
-The colours are very vibrant, Personally lots of bright red hurts my eyes, So the RED level is really hard for me to play
-Depending on what colour you put your enemies too, You might not be able to tell them appart from the background
-Too little unlockables
-Needs more customization (I'll come back to this later)
-There should be a counter on the side of each country which say how many people are playing and what gamemodes they are playing, Since I was waiting for a freezetag game for 10 minutes and didn't find one.

MY IDEAS;
-Add a couter to show how many people are playing on which gamemodes
-Add a unlockable which lets you design a laser design (Though make a reporting system aswell, Since people with draw unmature things with it)
-Like CS;S/TF2 has sprays, I think this game should have a custom logo you can put on your gun which you could draw ingame
-More gamemodes would be nice, Since everyone just play deathmatch
-A way too lower graphics for people who don't have good computers, I have a half decent computer and still get 50 fps.
-A way too make custom maps, Which could be voted on to be made into offcial maps, The more highly rated will appear higher on the page, And a dev can either accept or decline it.

IDEAS FOR NEW GAMEMODES;
Boss mode - 1v10, Boss can take lots of hits and you can only play boss at a rating higher than a certain amount
Jump mode - Jump maps, Get from point A too B with only rocket jumps.
Mini game maps - Custom maps which have been accepted into the game with devs approval

These were just my ideas, Hope I was helpful, First time typing something this long. :-D",Recommended,43,1

-No one hacks. Welcome to Arena shooters, where people are actually GOOD.
-Playerbase isn't actually that bad, 5 minutes max to find a game. Sometimes fully lobby.
-Movement isn't bad at all, you just aren't supposed to walk around / trying to strafe. Movement is perfect if you just jump / use boost all the time.

In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work - and their selves - to our judgement. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.


But there are times when a critic truly risks something - and that is in the discovery and defence of the New. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The New needs friends. Last night I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement.
They have rocked me to my core.

In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto; ""anyone can cook."" But I realise, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's - who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France!

I will be returning to Gusteau's soon - hungry for more.",Recommended,16,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Ever wanted to play a tf2 class which had the fast pace of a scout, the y-as craziness of a soldier and the aiming of a sniper?
Then this game is made for you! The fast pace and the even play ground makes this game 100% skill based while the random cosmetic features makes it just fun to watch yourself die and get blown like a balloon.

The only con I can call is the lack of alot of players, but the moment you find that person who's just a little bit better then you and can wait when you're going AFK,or play weird small mini games inside of the game then it's a real fun time.

It's difinitely worth a try, if you wanted to play a game with the aim needed counter strike,the vertical awesomeness of tf2 and the quake mode it originated from,just like the cosmetics and the speed and braindeadness of every call of duty game after modern warfare? Then this is it!",Recommended,51,5

CONS:
This is probably the most important thing: no one plays. The player base is insanely tiny. You pretty much need to coordinate with others.

PROS:
It's a great game. Straight forward mechanics with a high skill ceiling. Smooth game play with an elegant art style that makes it future proof.

THOUGHTS:
If the developers made this free and added a cosmetic system, they would probably make more money than they do now. A rework of rankings and adding a competitive mode would absolutely make this blow up. It's a shame the current model is so unsustainable.",Recommended,17 people found this review helpful 0,1

Extremely simple and skill intensive. I appreciate all the options to customize the game such as map saturation, player colors, FOV slider, hide weapon models, beam trails etc.

The online is mostly dead but there's usually 1 or 2 lobbies for free for all deathmatch. No one is playing the other modes like capture the flag or freeze tag. As if the playerbase wasn't low enough there's two types of people that kill the game even further.

1. A player that can actually aim and has accuracy over 20% will cause most of the players to leave. Then you're stuck 1v1ing this pro.

2. People that vote for that awful Minecraft map that has 0 verticality, lava hazards, and is just a really narrow enclosed loop.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Ratz Instagib, a game I played really early on, and now that it's on Steam with noticeable improvements, prettier, more maps, more customization, unlockable cosmetics, more game modes, private matches, and more fun.

The game is for people who hunger for the 'Instagib' game mode, like me, because its hard to get really good ones nowadays, aside from the old ones that has it, but this game has a focus one that one game mode only, which is Instagib, meaning insta-kill, one shot one kill, and this one is a great one, and as far as I know, it's the best one.

All the game modes are great, duel mode, death match, team death match, capture the flag, freeze tag, and survival. I haven't tried freeze tag yet, but everything else is nice, fun, and competitive, the most competitive an FPS can be actually, and it's not just doing matches and winning, there's a skill progression in which the game monitors your skill and ranks you accordingly. There's also unlockables that you can set a goal for to unlock, these unlockables are only cosmetic and will not change the games simple fair and competitive nature.

The one thing I have an issue with is the same issue I have with any multiplayer game only, and that is it doesn't have bots to sustain the game if there are no players to play it at any given time, so keep that in mind, but it has a game mode in which you can play the game and shoot at things, and that is the survival game mode, it's a solo or coop game made where you (your self or with your friends) go up against a horde of unique (land and flying) enemies where you have to dodge their slow orb-like projectiles, and shoot their core at the center of their bodies, so it's not normal bots of the same type as you with the same weapons, but it's good, requires more precision, and good to play solo or with your friends as coop. It's better than nothing one would say.

For the asking price, for the fan that I am for Instagib, and for the content that it has and future content that it will have, it's worth it, even more so if they add normal insta-gibbing bots to play with.

tl;dr -> If you were born during the Unreal, Quake, and Scouts-Knives era, then pick up this game already. It's sniper paintball with boosting. And everyone's on speed. 11/10.

The developer was kind enough to give out a bunch of keys when this game launched on steam, and a good friend got me a key even though I had missed the giveaway by 15 minutes. I was very excited to feel all the nostalgia of my instagibbing days. The experience was satisfying and great.

If you enjoy instagib (one hit kill) gameplay, boosting (shooting the ground to shoot yourself upwards), twitch shooting, and an intense, fast-paced FPS experience, then you will enjoy this game.

As a disclaimer, I always try to avoid mentioning the price of a game if I feel that its mechanics make up for any monetary value, however, for the current price ($9.99), the game is more than a finished product for an early-access game. Believe me, you will get your money's worth for this price if you are looking for a no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ instagib experience.

The aesthetics are very good - the levels are nice and bright and colorful. You can customize everything from the color/type of your laser beam, to the type of explosions when you kill an opponent, to the color of your character model (and your opponents'). Personally, I prefer to have the environment in greyscale and the enemy in a bright, pop-out color (red). You can even change the color of your name in-game. When you shoot, it will leave a paintball-style mark in the color of your laser - by the end of the match, the area will look like a paintball battlefield. The music and sounds are very good, especially if you like electronic music.

The controls are typical of a traditional FPS, however, you will need to get used to the instagib style if you are a newcomer - boosting (shooting the ground to propel yourself) and constantly moving is a necessity to survival. Being able to shoot from a far is also essential (you can play around with the FOV, however, I feel that the max setting is a bit disorienting). Be warned, the instagib community for most games is relentless and unforgiving, so don't be surprised or disheartened if you have a hard time getting kills. From the servers I've played, the community seems very friendly. There is no tutorial, and the learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with FPS games - in particular, with the instagib game mode.

Gameplay is extremely fast-paced - you must constantly remain on the move. There are a variety of game modes, like deathmatch and team deathmatch. The online community is fairly small, but still decent - you might not always have a full server. Everyone dies with one hit, and you can shoot across the entire map. Staying mobile, timing your boost jumps, and maintaining battlefield awareness (this is where the high DPI players will get to flex their skills) is critical to doing well in this game.

Overall, the instagib game mode is represented very, very well in Ratz, and anyone interested in that style of FPS should definitely check this out.

Recommend!

What an awesome game. Old school insta-gib action. Start the game and and start playing, no long load times, no BS.

Positives:
-Gameplay is awesome, lag free smooth as hell action. Quick movements like in the old school shooters and if you're a fan of those you will love this game. You can sort of ""rocket jump"" too with the booster thingy of the gun.
-Bright and colorful cartoony graphics, which are decent. You can spot enemies easily. The default enemy color works best against almost all the maps but if it doesn't work you can always change the enemy colors from the options menu.
-Music is EPIC, like one of my favorite tracks in any game.
-Lots of options to adjust, you can even take your FOV upto 180. You can adjust your beam color, the enemy ratz's colors. Hell you can even customize colors in your name.
-Ratz fortress 2, introducing hats will please hat lovers like myself. You get random drops like in TF2 but if you don't like them just sell em on the market. Literally free money.


Negatives:
-Despite having lots of game modes like FFA ,TDM, CTF, DUEL etc you will only find players on FFA. The other games are mostly abandoned and no one plays them.
-Servers are mostly empty. You get some traffic at evenings but i couldn't find a match whenever i tried playing in the day time.
-Some technical fault with hit registration, i noticed a lot of times i hit the enemy and i hear the hit sound even before they (or someone else) kill me but my kill doesn't count. I am gonna assume that has to do with lag compensation or something like that.


Conclusion:

Get it if you're a fan of old school shooters such as Unreal tournament and Quake. Loving this game these days. I would highly recommend this game.",Recommended,21,0

Ratz Instagib 2.0
Summary
Ratz Instagib is a skill and aim-based arena FPS. It's fast-paced but very fair - each player has the same loadout: a perfectly accurate railgun and boost jumps. This is what makes the game so skill-based and competitive: you have to put your training to the test because you won't be getting lucky with any of Counter-Strike or Call of Duty's spray RNG. It's a great way to practice aiming, even if you're not in it for the cosmetics, rating, or high scores.

A great little game to play with friends. It's a good and simplistic FPS arena-shooter with lots of user-generated maps yet its a lot more casual than you may expect from an arena-shooter. The chill drum 'n bass soundtrack also adds to the calm vibes. As the name suggests, it's a one-hit-one-frag game. You only need to know 3 controls - WASD, left click and right click. Even with this simplicity, it is hard to master air-strafing and aiming whilst travelling at great speeds.

This is a wonderful game. It's simple but well made, there are plenty of settings to fine-tune the graphics/controls, and the gameplay loop is super addicting. However, my absolute favorite part of this game is the music; It just fits so incredibly well. The soundtrack consists of fast (and somehow very relaxing) drum and bass/electronic instrumentals that do an incredible job of setting the atmosphere of the game. My only issues with this game are that the playerbase is next to non existent, and while there are bots, the AI isn't great.
All that being said, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this game if you have at least one friend to play with. I've sunk hours into this game by just having casual conversations with my friends while playing. It's a really good game to zone out to.",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 0,1

Ratz Instagib seems like a normal FPS at first. You just frag other playerz with railguns, zooming around the map. Typical twitchy shooter stuff.

But soon the immersion starts to consume. The hyper-real rat shrieks n skreels is infectious in ur neural pathwayz. Their beady eyez followin n traceekin your every chomp n scurry. You realize YOU have morphed to e-rat. Just anutha digi-rodent blipscurrying fru the micro-tunnilz of the simulationssssss

You start glitching thru walls finding secret tunnels and alcoves full of hypnotic blinking LED lightz and apparitions of mouse overlords. They are controlling this realm, manipulating the cheese supply that we so crave. The maps become an Escher-like maze of platforms and ladders leading to more elite hyper-cheese only the Anonymous Mouse Master Hacker Squad can manifest.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This review is constructive criticism ONLY. I suggest that everyone try the game for themselves and form their own opinions.

-PROS-
Ratz maps
Instagib
Soundtrack
Multiple Gamemodes
Clear effort was put into this game
The devs have actively updated this game and I definetly see them completing it, which can't be said for many early access titles.

-CONS-
Movement feels absolutely terrible
Characters feel weightless (personal con, may not bother you)
Rails inconsistent with objects
Inconsistent boosts
No auto team balancing (in Team Deathmatch at least)
No way to see pings on players
Soundtrack (It becomes repetitive and annoying after hearing it for the 20th time)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I bought this game as a veteran of FPS games, growing up with the likes of Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament, and Counter Strike when I saw this game I was instantly excited. From the videos here on steam and the reviews it appears to be a great nostalgia stimulating experience which will have you thinking back to ""the old days"" once again.

After watching the steam trailers and looking at the reviews I had somewhat expected it to be a standalone railgun type game on ratz maps.

What I got was a game where the movement feels awful, to the point where I'm not even sure if I'll ever touch it again for that main reason. Maybe I've become accustomed to other games styles of movement but something about Ratz Instagib's style of movement rubs me the wrong way. This is something that every player will have a difference in opinion on and has to experience it firsthand to fully understand what I truly mean when I describe it as awful.

You use your gun to boost in a similar manner to rocket jumping in Quake/UT, that's another huge mechanic that just feels really badly done and would benefit if it was made into a simple double jump/boost maneuver instead. Often times after boosting at an angle to propel myself forward and increase velocity I found myself slowing down instead, that's a huge problem in a game where it only takes 1 shot to kill you. I also at times found myself pressing the boost button only for it not to respond and end with me dead. Boosting is also the main way to get around the map, however there is a jump feature but after many attempts to string together more than a few jumps to gain speed and move around the map I found that it was largely ineffective.

Another issue would be the fact that rails are inconsistent with objects, quite a few times I was killed by rails that just seemed to magically go right through the object I was dodging my opponent around. I'm not sure if this an intended feature but I'm going to assume not since it couldn't be repeated on a consistent basis.

Looking past these HUGE issues there's tons of little ones that stuck out to me almost instantly. The lack of auto balancing teams in TDM leads to 2v1 situations on a consistent basis which honestly just amazes me that the developers didn't include a key feature like this before putting this up for early access. There is also no way to view current players pings to tell if someone is truly lagging or not, once again something that should be in the game before putting it up for early access.

Another small issue would be that players just generally feel weightless, this is something that may not bother everyone but I found it to be extremely disorienting after many years of enjoying other similar games.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entire game needs some real changes so that it will feel solid enough before this game comes out of early access. The boosting feature should also be re-evaluated to see if it can be made more consistent as well as experimenting with the possibility of removing it all together in favor of a better alternative. Adding additional music to cut down on the repetitiveness would be highly advised as well. Overall, the game would be fun to play if they could tighten up the movement and that's the real deal breaker as of right now for me.

I really want to like Ratz Instagib and I intend to try and continue to play it and keep up with the development but I cannot recommend that people purchase this game in it's current state. However that does not mean this game is bad what-so-ever, I'm finding myself enjoying the game a lot even with what I mentioned above. You need to play the game and try it for yourself, cause it's blast. It is currently on sale for $6.02 USD and usually sells for $8.99 USD, I feel that at this discounted price that I have gotten my full moneys worth and honestly would of purchased it at full retail.",Not Recommended,74,3

The Modern Golden Gun
Ratz Instagib is a multiplayer-only arena/twitch-shooter taken after a popular Quake & Unreal Tournament mod - instagib. This game mode is known for its one-hit, one-kill style of play and to excel at it, one must truly become a master of reflexes, map awareness, and precision. Unfortunately, the popularity of arena shooters has heavily declined over the recent decade, but Ratz Instagib manages to bring back the cult classic game mode many of us used to once love and cherish.


There are 4 different public server regions to connect to upon launching the game: United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. I live in the US and the ping for the US server has been fine on my end. User experience may vary depending on the location. Alternatively, you can also create a private server for friends to join.


There are currently 6 different game modes supported in Ratz Instagib, described below, along with leaderboards.








There are 13 official maps, however, you can download and play a multitude of Steam Workshop maps due to a native level editor (RatzED). At the moment, there are over 300 Workshop maps to play on (including popular Unreal Tournament maps) that have been generated by other players.


In a normal match, your game rank, hit % and # of frags (kills) are presented. The game ends when the frag limit or time limit is reached. Depending on your game rank (how well you performed for that specific game, frag-wise), your player rating will adjust accordingly. A 5 level global rating system is used to rank players among Duel/FFA game types.


A core feature of Ratz Instagib is its player customization and urge to attain unlockables. The current character model has 3 accessory slots and 1 headpiece slot to display vanity items. Along with this, you have the option to customize beam color, enemy color, frag types (death animations) and beam types. Almost every visual aspect can be personalized, such as: FOV, crosshair types, etc.


The level editor (RatzEd) is relatively advanced, yet user friendly. RatzEd allows you to control lighting & player start locations, import unique meshes, and create custom textures along with providing basic level editor options (furniture, toys, objects, voxel units, etc.).


Along with general FPS movement, you can jump and activate a boost (aim at the ground/wall to propel yourself). This boost mechanic changes up how many of us used to play the game mode, as boosting can provide a much more controlled and powerful gap-closer/maker than dodging ever could. It is also important to know that controllers (gamepads) are not officially supported.


Ratz Instagib is a great and addictively fun product. I have yet to encounter any problems regarding ping, disconnections, matchmaking, or the player base. Although the instagib game mode and its nostalgia is what makes this game shine, the player customization options and friendly level editor (along with the vast amount of currently released Workshop levels) earn it a recommendation for any fan of twitch-shooters or players looking to re-experience the instagib game mode. With such a lack of similar games in this genre, especially on Steam, Ratz Instagib definitely shines above the rest and deserves a chance to be in your library.",Recommended,7,0

A Dazzlingly Bright Gem With Fatal Flaws
It's not often that you can come out and say what I'm about to say, but Ratz Instagib is unironically the most fluid arena shooter that I think has ever been created. Maybe other games have different weapons or more iconic maps and sound effects, but when it comes to raw movement and the way a game handles raw aim, nothing does it better. It's hard to sound serious when the game's theme is so silly, but I'm not joking.

But there is a little problem.. Actually, it might be a really catastrophic problem for most people. The game is utterly dead. I'm not just talking about one of two lobbies with full player counts or anything like that, I'm talking completely, 100% DEAD. Despite that, if you head over to the community tab for Ratz Instagib, you'll see people constantly asking to play and trying to see if people can organise game nights. From what I've seen, these only sometimes become a reality though. As it stands, the only real action you can get is if you have a friend or two that you want to verse and you host a game yourself (which isn't hard). If you do try to find a game, you'll quickly get put into a practice waiting lobby where a single bot roams around. The bot is somewhat okay, but doesn't challenge you in the way a real player might.

So should you buy this game? If you have a love for arena fps, and you feel intrigued by what's on display here, I would recommend it, but you simply shouldn't buy it at full price because the product isn't even all there right now. I can see some random community spike happening in which the game gets a die hard fanbase that actually do play every day, but as it is now, the game is functionally a fun verses experience with friends at best, and an aim trainer at worst.

I have to recommend the game though, because it truly is a hidden gem, and everyone that has played it knows as much. This is a rare case of the community of players knowing how good a game is, but not being able to keep it alive due to how hard it is to find a public game. The solution to most people is to make the game free so that there's always enough players coming in to try it out, and so new players actually have a good experience because they can actually find a game. But that doesn't seem like it's ever going to happen, as the developer is very aware of this and doesn't seem to agree with it, or maybe they just don't care.

Either way, hats off to them for creating a true masterpiece of fps history. A game that ticks all the boxes for many, but a game that will likely fade into obscurity, only to never be replaced by anything as satisfying.

_____________________________________________________________________

, I just have to say that this game has one of the best soundtracks ever. I love the liquid jazz drum and bass on display here and I think it's a great showcase of a lesser known, but ultra enjoyable genre of music that I've loved for as long as I've known it. It's quite calming for an fps, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do, which is get you in the zone. The speed is satisfying and the percussion vocalizes the almost rhythmic element that arena fps has always had. It's an absolute standout to me and I highly recommend looking into the tracklist on youtube even if you don't purchase the game.",Recommended,10,4

I first wrote this review in early access, but it is now UPDATED as of 2017-03-17

Ratz Instagib is a no-b*llsh*t, super fast-paced shooter where anyone can jump in and learn how to play in seconds. At the same time, the gameplay is almost completely skill-based and your aiming and movement skills (which can take weeks or months to master, especially the aim) directly determine the outcome of the game.
The game mechanics are as simple as it can get: you only have one weapon, the railgun, which is a one hit kill and you can boost in any direction (kind of like a rocket jump) by right clicking. The enemy hitboxes are extremely small and movement is extremely fast, which means that you have to be really good at aiming to hit your enemies.

Pros:
+ Very fast paced gameplay
+ Balanced, competitive gameplay
+ Responsive and smooth controls
+ Lots of customizations in the options menu (enemy colors, beam color, nickname color, X and Y mouse velocity, and a ton of other graphical options).
+ Performance is pretty good even though the game is made in Unity. I'm getting ~300-400fps on a i7-4790k and Sapphire r9 270x running at 1920x1080@120hz, I'd never expect an unity game to run so fast.
+ Multiple gamemodes
+ User-made workshop maps
+ Now allows connecting to a custom server

Cons:
- Could've included non-instagib gamemodes with the standard arena fps weapons and pickups

I highly recommend this as it's a lot of fun and also a great aim warm-up for games like Quake.",Recommended,11,1

TL;DR: This game does a great job of being original and fun, It really does have a good style that not a lot of shooters can pull off now-n-days. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to sit down and have a blast with friends. It's worth full price but if you can pick it up on sale.

Okay, before I talk about the gameplay let me address a few things. First, you play as a colored childish rat that looks like they are trying to take over the world. Second, prepare to either feel like a god or rage more then sith lords that don't get their way. And third, don't play this game without friends, because it's just not nearly as fun w/o a rage buddy.

Alright, first pros:
- Fast paced
- Fun movement
- Lots of items to customize your rat
- One shot kills
- Special kills (Head shots, crouch shots, both having different animations)
- Unlockable beam and frag types
- Unique game mode Freeze Tag
- Fun ranking system
- Ranked play
- Can customize your name to anything with a rainbow of colors, You can even use "" ""
- More that I can't think of atm because this game is just too awesome

Cons:
- Getting stuck in a game with really high skilled players can kill it
- There are blatent hackers in some games
- Movement sometimes bugs out
- No invisible walls to keep you in the map
- Lava pools suck
- This game can result in massive amounts of slurs and profanity

Overall:
This game is amazing, with only a few friends in a game you can have more fun than most other shooters. The movement is very momentum based and is super fun and fast. Each map feels like it's telling some form of story, and the coloring is amazingly done. This game does a great job of being original and fun, It really does have a good style that not a lot of shooters can pull off now-n-days. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to sit down and have a blast with friends. It's worth full price but if you can pick it up on sale.

Ratz Instagib is the culmination of a masterpiece and represents the essence of hard work. After playing it for a brief amount of time, it is evident that mechanically, the game asserts its superiority against other first-person shooters. The movement is carefully articulated in the way in which it grips players. It almost seems like it devours any sense of reality. As minutes pass, perhaps even hours, players will find themselves fully engaged in the combat, drenched in the very pools of sweat they generated themselves. On paper, the game is quite simple and may seem it lacks depth. However, deep down it contains elements of addiction, determination, and passion. The constituents that lurk beneath the unforgiving presentation of the game creates an unforgettable atmosphere. Experiences forged by the player cultivate and expound throughout the gameplay. The game truly holds a wealth of content. The immersive functionality breathes new light into the genre. It almost seems as if it follows the formula of first-person shooters while straying away to convey uniqueness. In this way, the game is oddly comforting, offering a sense of familiarity while still providing an exhilarating thrill.",Recommended,9,1

Ratz Instagib came out of left-field for me. I discovered this game on the last week of 2016, when a friend of mine mentioned it over dinner. Later that night he bought the game for me, and I've been hooked ever since.

The game's instantly familiar to anybody who's spent their fair share of time playing arena FPS games, specifically ""instagib"" game modes or mods. You're given a weapon with lethal power and perfect accuracy, held back by a relatively long cooldown time between shots (in Ratz, it's fast enough to allow for follow-up shots after whiffing a target, but you're not rapid-firing this thing). You'll need to hit enemies to earn frags, while dodging their own shots. All of the maps are oversized human interiors, giving the feeling that you're rat-sized in a familiar world (another reference to arena FPS games and the popular ""rats"" style of honey-I-shrunk-the-kids custom maps in Quake, Unreal Tournament, and especially Counter-Strike).

The game offers plenty of customization, both in the form of extensive options (another wonderful concession to the tweak-loving arena FPS crowd), player avatar cosmetics, and even custom maps.

Ratz Instagib is a celebration of the Arena FPS and its community: From the giant bedroom maps to the tight instagib gamemodes and even the drum-n-bass soundtrack that makes me feel like I'm playing my very own frag compilation video. Fantastic custom map support, a plethora of options with support for minimal-visual ""pro-gamer"" settings (and even coloring your name!), and unlockable weapon effects based on player skill show that this is a game made by arena FPS fans, for arena FPS fans.",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
""Jeez, this game looks terrible! Why would I ever buy this game?"" You may be thinking as you look at it. In my opinion the screenshots of the game just don't do it justice. Ratz Instagib is a GREAT game to just sit down with friends, or even yourself, and just play some rounds. One of the great things that I love about this game is the simplicity; Walk, jump, boost, zoom, and shoot. That's all there is to it. Yes, it's a frustrating game that makes you want to throw your keyboard at the nearest living being. And sure, it's not a GRAPHICS OF THE DECADE game. And no, it doesn't have thousands of weapons that shoots rainbows out of your ass while dubstep blares. But the gameplay is just too fun to pass up. It's a fast paced game that gives you and amazing rush when you get large kill streaks. Just go play it, you just might love it.",Recommended,7,1

Online Community is dead. You're better off with games like UT or Quake and using instagib options in those. Way more versatile and bigger community than this will ever be.
Oh yeah, any items that drop and you receive will also go into your Steam inventory and it's not tradable or marketable. wtf

Got this game as a gift. I like it. It would be perfect except for one thing. The hats you can put on your cat dont have ear holes for your cat ears. If the hats you got had cat ear holes for your ears to poke through. It would be perfect. I also dont like that the headphones hat are the only option to change the monotenous music that never stops. I couldnt find any music volume controls in the game either. I would like to turn off the music but leave the fishing/fish/water sounds on but there was no option. Other then that it was a fun game.",Recommended,80,6

I think many phone games should just stay on their tiny little screens, but there are some I've enjoyed on PC. I really want to make some witty comment like Cat Goes Fishing has me hooked, but I really don't feel that strongly about it. It's fun, in a casual, play a bit here and there way, which seems to be the phone game mantra.
Cat Goes Fishing does take a bit of strategy, as you have to use smaller fish to catch larger ones, while trying to get the bait to the fish you want to catch. This layered approach to baiting fish may seem tricky at first, but keep at it and in no time you'll be a master baiter.",Recommended,574,15

I bought this for my young daughter, but it was too hard for her to play.
I ended up playing it and it was overall quite fun.
My only negative, which actually is quite annoying, is the hats.

My rant on hats.
The current system is you every time you find a hat, you get to keep it and lose the one you have, or vice versa. Some hats you can 'rebuy' that you found. Others you cant.
Ive read that the hats can 'possibly' respawn randomly at times and be found again.
The problem with this system is that it sucks.
I, an owner of many hats, do not see the need to rebuy my hats i already aquired, much less some for some reason that are mysteriously never available to even buy again.
Honestly if i could rebuy ANY hat ive already found id possibly not even mention it.
Thats however not the case.
I should be able to swap to any hat ive already found any time i want, and only have an option to sell the crappy ones ones i honestly may want to sell, not because i have no choice.

This really sucks how they have it set up atm.

That all said.. the game is still decent enough and as annoying badly implemented they have done the hats..

If they fixed this.. id say the game was completely awesome. HINT. HINT.",Recommended,54,0

Okay I will be the first to admit that people slap Cat on to something and call it a day and it sells like hot cakes. It has become almost a trend in gaming to put a Cat or funny animal into an unusual role and forget the importance of game design. When it comes to Cat Gone Fishing, the adorable aesthetic aside. The game is very well designed and highly addictive. Yes, it's a cat holding a fishing rod and it is adorable but that aside the core gameplay of Cat Goes Fishing is what I enjoyed most about this game. With dozens of upgrades available for your rod, boat, radar and more, you will turn your Cat into a fishing machine as you begin to battle the monsters underneath the surface. Cat Goes Fishing is a wonderful game to just load up and completely just fall into and relax while you play it, discovering even more aquatic animals after you think you've found everything. The only true complaint I could have about the game is it's lack of options, Cat Goes Fishing shows its mobile roots with no shame. While this may be disconcerting to some, I found the positives of this fun and adorable game to far outweigh the bad. Besides, guys, it's a Cat wearing a hat and fishing! Come on! It's adorable!!

This is an adorable game that looks casual on the surface but does actually have a deceptive depth of gameplay. Well, as much gameplay as you can get with a single cat click. It's cute, it's fun and in a few minutes play you'll be hooked. After playing WoW for so many years, I never thought I'd admit to fishing being enjoyable but this game really lured me in.

With a bit of purrsuasion in the form of different baits, you catch the fish and sell them for money or use them as ever increasing temptations to catch bigger and betta fish whilst warding off hordes of hungry tiddlers.

Did I mention your cat can wear hats? Purrfect. You don't need to be a brain sturgeon to realize this is worth buying - it only costs a few squid!

I knew ""one more round"" syndrome before, but now I know also ""one more fish"" syndrome.
When you look at those screenshots, you're thinking: that game is not for me. I thought so too, and now I can't stop playing.

VERDICT:
Even if you think you don't like such games, you should try that. You may be surprised.

This is honestly a super fun game. I would like to say it's relaxing, and to be honest at the start it is, but then as you get into late game fishing it turns into screaming at your monitor as the stupid fish you don't want intercept you at every turn. The fish are interesting and funny, have their quirks for catching that are fun to learn as you go. It's very rewarding when you spend a long time and many many many many attempts to catch one fish then you finally get it (I'm looking at you cave shark....you jerk.....and you dragon). I highly recommend the game because you spend all your time enjoying it that you don't even realize that the sun is up and you're late for work. 10/10",Recommended,29,0

Well, this is a surprisingly fun game. It looks exactly like it's shown on the product page and plays exactly as you might imagine. You simply cast and reel, upgrade as you earn cash from fish caught, finish quests (which might be catch x number of this type of fish, cast this far, this deep, etc...).

That is basically it. Although it is one of the most simplistic, basic games I have ever played, it's ability to provide a very fun, casual experience is almost peerless. Cats love fish, so wouldn't this be fun, right?

That is pretty much it. Try it. You are almost guaranteed to enjoy it, and it will provide a nice break for when you aren't sure what else you want to play or just don't feel like playing anything else.

Its an addicted ""flash"" game where you play like a CAT and you sitting up the stream and catching the fishes. You earn money and XP so you can LVL up and also buy some better stuff.

There are also some RPG element. Like you can were a hat/cap, can use other Rod, ...

There is also a kind of ""shop type menu"" where you can buy better Rod, a rocket to throw farther, ...

Also there is a lot of different kind of fishes ... and not only fishes.

what an awesome fun this game is, i loved every second of it.
lots of upgrades, Rods, Boats and fish types, the Realism mode is where the real fun at <3. main Difference between Normal mode and Realism is that fishes will fight back and won't be caught easily, you need to becareful or they will escape your bait.

the pace of the game feels right and you will reach your new upgrades fast enough that it never gets boring as you reach new depths and discover more and more fishes.

This game is amazing. At the start of the game, you are sitting there on a piece of land with just a simple rod to your name, as you progress you find new fish, each separately rated, each giving a certain amount of money. Eventually you do more quests and can get special upgrades to help you on your journey such as sonar or a mini-map. Eventually you get enough to get a boat and venture out further. You discover new fish and animals, you get new fishing rods with new upgrades explore further and further. You then go deeper and eventually find hats that give special bonuses. That's all assuming you are casually playing. You can play in realism mode which will make fish fight back. There's tons of lore to explore and you can keep playing for hours. There's a way to beat the game that (I guarantee) you won't be able to find without looking it up.

There are only a couple bad things to this game though. It has a lack of story line to it, it has tons of things you can look at that keep you thinking about before you started your journey, but not much story line. It has a weird money system as well in which you can get a fish, that say, is worth 64,000 in game cash. at that point when you get that its 1/5 of what you want for your next upgrade. You progress fast, then slow, then fast again. From my experience big fish worth a lot respawn 1-5 hours a time. This ranges per fish. This game also takes a lot of google searches on your first run. The last thing about this game is the downside in realism mode. I love how the game on this mode makes fish be able to fight back, but some are too powerful. A fish that is at spawn but very deep down, even with the best fishing rod and the best upgrades, can't be reeled in normally without tons of effort. You usually have to cheese the game and make it come directly above your rod and then pull it in, in less than a second.

Other than those, its one of my favorite games.

Cat Goes Fishing is a simple but very cute and fun indie fishing simulator. You play as a furry little cat and in front of you lies a vast sea to scour and fish. You start on land with only a basic rod. Then you can sell the fish you catch for money to buy improved fishing gear, boats, and plenty of other items to help you catch some of the bigger, more challenging, and rare fish. There is a good amount of customization which allows you to develop your own style of fishing. The game is very relaxing and casual, and the simple controls makes it easy to play. Still there is plenty of action and strategy involved in wrestling the fish back to the surface without being eaten by bigger fish. There is a large and unique variety of fish, and a organized log to keep track of the fish you caught. Each type of fish has its own behavior and specific location that adds to the challenge of catching it. You can also find plenty of hats to wear in the sea that add a nice bonus and cosmetic to your cat. Cat Goes Fishing is short, though there is a surprising amount of depth and a lot of charm which makes this game highly replayable. This game is well worth the money and the time spent.",Recommended,22,0

At first it looks innocent and calming.. Once you get into it, you'll see the world this game has to offer.. it's not that deep, but it has some depth.
Also if you're a first timer and overachiever, do not play the classic. Just go for realism for 100% achievement.

When you're frustrated at the game.. just remember after you unlock better rod and better boat, the game will gradually become easier (duh).

Overall I can recommend the game with the price tag, my only cons is that the graphic is merda (italian). I mean not the artstyle but the graphic resolution is maximum 720p.

Avoid buying if you're easily bugged with blurry gameplay and if you're using higher than 1080p resolution monitor or bigger than 24 inch monitor.",Recommended,14,5

This is a ridiculously cute and relaxing game. Cute and relaxing does not also mean boring, however. There's always things to work towards (catching certain fish, acquiring new gear, etc.). I was honestly surprised that there's enough to strive for in Cat Goes Fishing to keep me interested. The amount of money you earn is reasonable for what you catch/how difficult the fish is to catch, and you earn it at a good rate, too. This means when you're eyeing that $50,000 boat, it won't be days until you have it; you will probably be able to earn the cash in half an hour, 45 minutes (or less if you don't purchase certain items that enhance your casting, like rockets. Zoom!)

Finally, the music is simple and pretty, and rounds out the relaxing gameplay perfectly. For under $7.00, it is well worth the purchase.",Recommended,15,1
4108,118,Cat Goes Fishing,"Posted: January 23, 2015
Cat Goes Fishing is a casual, cat-induced, 2-D fishing ‘simulator.’ The goal here is to use an array of tools, including rods, boats, even bombs in conjunction with upgrades to complete a host of quests.

The casting mechanics are fairly straightforward, as there are only three buttons you’re likely to ever use. Click for casting/reeling & A/D for movement. There is no tutorial as of the writing of this review, but getting the general sense on how to start casting to maximum effect is quite simple. There isn’t any Menu either.

While, the casting & movement mechanics couldn’t get any simpler, there is some depth on how you choose to complete the quests. There are many different types of effects you can apply to your rod to target or dissuade various types of fish or to augment other elements. There are also tools both temporary & permanent that will come in handy.

As you catch fish & complete quests, you will level & accrue currency. As you level, the quests get progressively more difficult. However, from my experience, there does appear to be a degree of randomness with respect to the quest system; old quests will pop up time & again. The quests will progressively get more & more grindy. Completing them will require you to farm currency for pro-longed periods of time, before you can purchase the necessary items & upgrades to complete them.

Yes, does have an array of hats. They are obtained by catching them so keep an eye out. The sad part is that you can’t collect them. You can only wear one hat at a time. Each hat provides a useful boost. Be wary of accidentally selling a hat, as it is easy to do.

There is an in-game catalog giving various details on the different types of fish, so it may yield some assistance in catching your desired fish.

The artwork is exactly as shown in the screenshots. The background scenery is under-utilized & quite bland. The sound is one uninspiring track looped continuously. Luckily, it can be muted with the ‘M’ key.

In conclusion, I wouldn’t label as a fishing simulator. I wouldn’t recommend it to those who love fishing & desire that experience, albeit through the eyes of a cat. Rather, is a game you pop in when you have a few minutes to kill, just for the posterity of seeing a cat catch some fish, while wearing a snazzy hat.",Recommended,19,1

Def would recommend. Overall 8-8.5/10 game for me. I usually don't leave reviews for games but I had a lot of fun playing this one. Calm music and pretty simple gameplay. Can be a little stressful when you want to catch the harder fish but that made the game fun for me. Was nice that they updated the game after a while and added new content. I had a good time and I felt like it ended on a good note after catching everything. Worth the 7 bucks tbh

4110,120,Cat Goes Fishing,"Posted: April 13, 2023
A cute little fishing game that starts out simple and gets more complex as you level. As you upgrade your gear, you decide on your rod and boat loadouts to catch progressively bigger fish and find cool hats. There's even rockets to make your cast go farther, and bombs to... well, get rid of pesky fish that might have gotten in your way.

Cat Goes Fishing is a pretty relaxing game, with fun moments of celebration as your strategies succeed and you manage to catch the exact fish you were after. Realism mode adds a little bit more difficulty to the game, as you have to reel in fish more carefully -- pretty great if you'd like a bit more challenge!

The only downside is that there really aren't any instructions, but if you keep catching fish and doing the quests, eventually you'll unlock things and figure out the next step.

Overall, relaxing and fun, with a bit of a strategic challenge!",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 1,0

A hesitant recommendation from me.
The game itself is pretty fun, though it's very grindy, and there isn't much in the way of an endgame.
But the biggest problem, by far, is the spawn rates. The game gives you quest, which revolve around you catching a specific fish. It encourages you to explore, and some of the stuff you have to do to catch certain fish is pretty interesting. But, because of the spawn rates for certain fish, it can become very, very easy to get soft locked on quests, because the fish you're looking for literally just don't exist on the map at that moment. They will respawn eventually, however this can take as little as a few minutes to hours upon hours of waiting for the fish to return.

It get's very frustrating very quickly when you get stuck, especially when you haven't done anything wrong. Sometimes, for no reason whatsoever as far as I can tell, certain fish will just disappear, leaving you stuck halfway through a pile of quests that can now no longer be finished.",Recommended,16 people found this review helpful 0,0

The game `Cat Goes Fishing´ turns out to be a minimalistic but nice pastime. It impresses with simple graphics in a sweet retro style. More setting possibilities would help, for example to switch out the music, which gets on nerve after a few fishing successes. But it is a good alternative to your yoga exercises in the evening.

I don't often review games because I am lazy, but this game deserves it. I am a 32 year old gamer and my fishing experience goes back 28 years. I played all the fishing games. A few truck simulators, all the farming simulators, most the cooking simulators, house fipping,thieving, pc buildings, job etc. This game is different then them all. Team work isn't wanted its absolutely needed. There is no fish feed, no glamour for the solo person with 50 fishes at the end you just get to celebrate the win while your countries music plays on the score tab. Its a very, very different game. I am not super familiar with this genre having only played cat mobile games for a few hours but the people playing this game are passionate. A lot of them take everything super serious which has its ups and downs but mostly ups. The player base is small enough you start to see the same people in games, but its large enough its always possible to find a full server to play on in less than 5 minutes. There is so many niches to fill in this game I suggest watching a youtube video before loading it up. The strats you need to win in this game take a lot of team coordination (average game has around 10 diff squads all geared towards diff tactics to help you win). I'm semi drunk and rambling but I really enjoy this game, yes there are times where you are getting crushed and you basically spawn in, run for 5 mins and die but those are few and far between. After a few games you get the hang of it start your own squad so you can have some control on where to place down spawn points. Who knows, maybe someday you'll have the balls to lead the entire 50 cat team as captain.",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 0,0

To be honest, when I first saw a bit of gameplay, I believed it to be a stereotypical fishing game akin to those found on Facebook, I was wrong. Cat Goes Fishing is an amazing game, and I would personally rate it high on the list of my favorite games of all time. Its simplistic design, its calm and relaxing music that can be changed by simply throwing a hat on, the gentle meow the cat gives off when catching a large fish, the annoyed groan the cat releases when catching a fish that's been sullied, the beautiful design and colors, the plentiful variety of upgrades for the cat's fishing rod, I digress. If this game somewhat intrigues you whatsoever, watch some gameplay of it, and if it still intrigues you, buy it, or peer pressure your friends into wasting more money on you.",Recommended,18,1

This is a very relaxed game. You play at your own pace but there are plenty of obstacles in this game that require some strategy and, quite honestly, a bit of luck. Really enjoyed playing through, collecting hats and delving further and further into the depths with improved gear. I wasn't able to catch every fish in the game yet so i will return from time to time to try to catch them all but after hitting lvl 50 I had completed most of the catalog and missions began to repeat themselves so it lost some steam. still fun to play on the side while waiting for another game to finish downloading or waiting in queue.",Recommended,15,0

Starting as cat with a basic rod the controls are simple, you can play this with one hand. Fishing up the smaller species initially and selling them will reward you with money, which is used for purchase of better rods or upgrades to current equipment. The game then introduces you to it's quest system, completing these tasks rewards larger sums of money. While questing the fish catalog becomes useful as it will display all species in the game.

Sometimes fishing in the depths you may discover rare hats, which not only look cute on cat but give large bonuses to both your fishing abilities and values of catches. More tongue in cheek one-use items available later include rockets and bombs but everything has it uses. In these cases scaring away packs of fish or making your cast go much further with cheaper rods. Boat travel is also included, but I have not progressed that far yet.

Content wise, If you check the store page the developer mentions and I quote.
""Regular updates will bring new fish, boats, hats, and entirely new mechanics to the game, extending your experience and offering new ways to master the game. ""

Addictive and enjoyable for all ages. Easily recommended.

Other than yarn, cats love fish! So instead of this cat waiting on it's master to give it fish, it'll give itself fish by fishing!

This is a game that's more about the atmosphere, casual play, and steady pacing. Not intended for rushing through the content, but to cast your line and hope you get a big one. The music is soothing and relaxing as well.

There is some strategy in play here, whether it's to lure or avoid fish, or try to get a specific fish. Be sure to keep an eye on your money too and try to make a profit per fish or load of fish. Buy a boat or better rods for bigger fish. Can even modified your rods for your own benefit.

The price is good, but wouldn't hurt to wait for a sale either.

Cat is gonna have a feast when he's done with this pond!

Try your luck in realism too!

Played 4 hours straight first time playing.

Good game!

Fun, has personality, and the Dev is listening to many ideas and feedback.

I wish I could give a more detailed review but if the trailer/gameplay vids draw you in like they did me,
give the game a shot, you will probably like it too.
It's simple enough that it's fun, but has enough depth that it keeps you playing.

Only thing I'd consider a downside is the endgame.
Once you unlock everything (I haven't as of yet though) then there's nothing more to accomplish.
However the Dev is taking ideas on end-game content so hopefully this will be remedied in the near future.

This is honestly surprisingly fun. I've played for over 40 hours so far, and I still find it fun to go back to if I'm bored. Catching every fish has proven quite difficult, but still achievable; I have 2 fish left to catch. The game is easy to pick up, there's only a couple buttons that you use regularly. The money aspect of the game doesn't last long, as you can max out all your equipment very quickly, so the end goal is to catch every fish. Classic mode is great if you're getting a feel of the game, but Realism is more fun. That being said, there will be a lot of frustrating moments when fish get away (I'm looking at you cave shark), but generally that frustration doesn't last long. Most fish are simple to catch - get the right sized bait, and dangle it in front of them - but other, rarer fish sometimes require something more complicated. You may need a certain fish as bait, maybe live bait, maybe turn off your sonar or even light! To add to the complexity of the game, there are hats and rod upgrades, which offer buffs to help your progression, whether it enhances your gameplay, adds multipliers, sets a time of day, or something else, they prove very useful. All in all, the game is a fun way to spend your free time when you don't feel like playing something intense, and I would definitely recommend this game to you if any of that sounds interesting.

The Mean Greens is a colorful, fun third person shooter made with the unreal engine. I will list the pros and cons of this game.
Pros:
+The game is colorful and enjoying to look at, maps like ""Art table"" are just riddled with colors, the lighting in the game is done right too.
+It runs like butter on my pc, and on my cheap laptop, I can't really imagine anyone experiencing framedrops with a decent setup.
+The music is catchy and nice to listen too, I had a smile on my face when I first heard the song during operation birthday, or hearing ride of the valkyres during Bathtub bash.
+Everyone has all the guns at all times, there is no reason to complain being killed.
+Each map has it's own game mode, all with different varieties. Modes like team deathmatch in the Table top wars map, FFA in the art table shuffle, Attack and defend in Operation birthday cake, and one of my favorites which is bathtub bash, a mode where you must ride rubber duckys to reach flags and deliver the flags back to your ship.

Now If what I said above is convincing you to buy the game, what I say next can probably change that.
Cons:
-While there are a ton of different game modes, some quite work out. In the map Operation birthday, the objective is to assault a birthday cake and light as much candles as you can while the enemy team stops you. After around halftime, the sides switch, so if team 1 lit 10 candles, all team 2 has to do is light 11. If team 2 lights 11 within the first minute, you've already won the game, and must wait the next 3 minutes until the round ends to be declared the winner (Which I think is stupid). Some game modes just require suicide to win. In the game modes Kitchen run and Deep freeze, all you have to do is run to your objective and do the action it tells you to (such as pushing the enemy cup off the table or unfreezing your dinosaur), so you can play the game for 4 minutes in a straight up tie, but 1 enemy touched your cup just slightly, and you lost the game.
-The servers can be absolutely horrible at times, you can hit join game and be waiting up to 3 minutes just so it could tell you that you failed to connect.
-The worst one would have to be-
The game is completely empty, I hit server browser only to find out there are 10 players online in TOTAL, if you are lucky you can find a server with maybe 6 people, and people usually leave during it. The game is fun with people to play, and no one ever plays.

Conclusion: I don't see the $10 dollar price being worth it up to now, I bought the game on release and I still don't feel like it was a good buy, but I can't not recommend this game, if you have a couple of buddys that will play it with you it's an excellent choice, otherwise wait for the price to be lowered. I see this more as a game that should be free to play, it's amazing but all it needs is a community to play it, and not a lot of people will pay for a game without players already playing it.

30 mins in & this game is incredible & absolutely worth the 99 cent purchase.
You'd be dumb otherwise. You can flawlessly create servers & have people join,
amazing UE4 graphics that run 100-144fps most of the time, max settings,
FX-8350, 8GB DDR3 & 6GB OC GTX 1060.
I wanted to buy it a couple yrs ago, but of course, nobody wanted to play it.
It really sucks when the PC community is so attached to games like CS:GO & PUBG 24/7 (being a long time player of both) which are extremely greedy and not willing to listen to the community, but rather throw in 1,000 microtransactions.
Then you have games like these that have a ton of super fun maps that're creative like the train map, roll the giant hamsters into their cage & can ride them, the bubblebath with a giant rubber octopus and rubberduck boats with flight of the valkyries to float across to the otherbase in fast-paced, quickspawn action with easy gameplay/controls, nothing to it.
Games like these deserve more recognition, i hope more people play this game.

8/10 for $10, but an easy 10/10 for 99 cents, can't beat it.

Update: 2020 & we back, baby.
Got some new maps, optimizations & a console release on the way.
That's great news, just hope the game stays buzzing since they plan on raising the price
back up again with console launch. I just don't know if that's a great idea
when the game isn't very popular at $5, I'd keep it at $1 or even free.
Maybe they'll be able to figure something out. For now it's funner than it ever was,
however it needs some proper bug fixing. Sometimes only able to move my mouse
if i aim, holding down right click, having to hit my ESC key twice & get back into the game
so i can properly play, sometimes hitting enter flickers the game in fullscreen
instead of opening chat to speak, and one of the BIGGEST things that it has had an issue with
since launch: You CANNOT join on friends, it will not work.
You'll join their game via Steam & end up in a completely random game,
and with no group/lobbying system, it makes getting into games with friends
more difficult than it needs to be. Other than that, great job on the updates,
still super fun & i still recommend it, it's worth more than $1, i just hope it gains more traction.",Recommended,204,0

How do you breathe life into a few years old game that has no real existing player base? Well, if our game is an online shooter, follow the path of Virtual Basement and Code Headquarters, drop the price to a buck for at least a short time, announce it with enthusiasm, and then be there to support your game despite it being several years old with the knowledge that, by doing so, you are basically giving a lot of new players a fun and inexpensive experience that they might otherwise never have known about, which in turn gives your game a whole new lease on life.

Story

Nada. Although you can extrapolate and make it the story of yo as a kid with your friends, setting up your little plastic army men in different scenarios and having them duke it out.


All things considered, The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare doesn't really do anything special from a gameplay perspective. To me, this game is not so far off of what Team Fortress 2 is, albeit with far less gameplay options.

Basically, you join an active server and start playing. There are five weapons available (assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, bazooka, flamethrower) plus grenades of course. There are no skills, rankings, or anything else to separate players. Each player is on the same footing in each game with only skill and luck separating one player from another. So, each battlefield is uniquely fair from start to finish.

I personally have only played on 20 and 40 player servers, where it's either every soldier for themselves, or it's team objective, and that is strictly determined by the specific map selected by the players (or chosen randomly if that option is selected by the majority). There is a kick option, but I haven't seen anybody use it yet, which is great since the one real issue this game has presently is there aren't enough ""official"" servers to host all the new players, which can make for long wait times waiting for the larger servers to have an open spot. Fortunately, you can create your own game, and can rent servers if you prefer as well. Plus, the longest wait I've experienced waiting to get into a server has been like a minute or two. Not bad considering.

There is one bug that is at play in a lot of matches, which we'll call the reload bug. Shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles will often bug out and not allow reloading. So often in fact that outside of people asking for votes on specific maps for the next match, the most common thing you will see in the in game chat are questions about how to reload your guns lol.


Well, as you can imagine, a game about little plastic soldiers is going to feature artwork that is whimsical and childlike in appearance. This takes the form of the various maps, which are all children's scenarios for playing war with your little plastic peeps. A bathtub, the kitchen counter, a literal sandbox, an artist table, and so on. The graphics are perfect for what this game is. Nothing mind blowing, but definitely appropriate.


The audio is fairly standard for online shooters. Nothing too memorable. There are tunes, there are sound of battle, etc...
The audio isn't really the focus for this game, but it works such as it is even if I'm hard pressed to really think of anything that stands out.


Stupid fun. Pick up and play goodness that presently will only cost you a buck. Best buck I've personally spent in a while.",Recommended,84,1

Short description about the game
It's basically a TPS, in a toy universe, the soldiers, the weapons, are actual toy figures.
The environment is funny, you can see big sponges, huge candles. Basically, everything is bigger than you.

Gameplay
About 10 maps, different game modes which are all fun, you all start with the same weapons, you don't buy ammo, you don't call for 'air support', or such.
It's a pretty simple and minimal game, and i love it for that, lately i've been too annoyed about the lack of actual fun shooters/online games that are also minimal.

Community
Well, it's too early to talk about the community, but, you shouldn't consider it much, basically, toxic players are in every game.
However i made this small section in my review to tell you a funny store that happened to me earlier in this game.
Someone randomly said 'Votekick X', i tried to defend that one 'X' because it didn't seem fair since he didn't do anything. That 'X' that was votekicked, actually votekicked me and said 'lol'.


First of all, the devs seem like they take care of the game, and they seem to be interested in actually solving problems, i point these out for them, in case someone slipped the details on the forums, and they actually read my review.

- Sudden loss of connection, happens basically, after almost every match, sometimes before joining one.
- The 'Find Game' option, often finds a game that is already full, which can be quite frustrating.
- There is too much ""invisible unwalkable space"" (sorry, can't really describe it better as English is not my main language). Basically, you can walk too close to a teammate or you will be blocked by some invisible space. Which can be bad if a teammate is AFK in some sort of small space. You can't walk past him even if there seems to be plenty of space.
- The votekicking can use some improvement, but i am pretty sure it's a bit obvious, and you probably didn't work on it so far because you were focused on the game itself.

So far, so good, i received this game as a gift, a beautiful gift that make me chuckle quite a bit upon seeing it. Also, brings me alot of childhood memories.
Damn you, nostalgia!

NOTE:
Regarding the lost connection issue, i think it's because of the ping, when you browse for servers join the ones with the lowest ping.

I would love a Steam Workshop for this, and some easy ways to create content for it :)",Recommended,108,11

As my childhood was all about army men games and figures, I was so excited with this game the moment I saw it, and it really does not disappoint me at all.

Pros:
+Super fun, fast pace gameplay.
+Ten different maps in total and each map has a unique objective: capture the flag, light the birthday cake candles, push the enemies' cup off the table etc. and my favourite is playing football, where each team need to put the ball in the opponent's goal while trying to blow the enemies' head off at the same time :P
+5 different weapons to switch easily between at your liking: assault rifle, sniper, shotgun, bazooka, flamethrower.
+Gorgeous graphics, and run extremely well.
+Very good and relaxing soundtrack.
+No competitive feeling, simply just fun, best thing to play after a stressful day.
+They have even added female character models now :D :D

Cons:
+No vehicle like tank, armoured car, mounted MG on jeep, anti-aircraft etc.
+No speciality class, no character customization.
+No bot to play with at night when everybody is sleeping, and the game has some connection issue, best way to play is browse from server and do not use the join game in the menu.

The little content aspect is actually acceptable for the price, but still it does even better than many triple A titles recently, which ask for 60 dollars but offer even less content than a 15 dollar game like this one!
For 10 dollars on sale or even when at full price I still think it's all worth it, and if you are a fan of army men you don't even need to read the review to decide, you must get it now!!

My review so far....

+ve points

No OP players due to class/upgrading weapons/spending a ton of real money getting better things - everyone starts out with the same weapons, it takes skills to master them.

Lovely graphics and the maps look beautiful - sometimes there are a few things that spoil this... but 99% of the time it looks stunning.

Good clean fun.... you turn on, go into a map and just start shooting. I can see teams of five people, using team speak, really making something of this. I can see tactics etc being used to win matches amongst five friends.

There are a few different game modes... the one involving the fooz table is my favourite so far... basically you have to score a goal whiles killing other army men!!

Plenty more scope... I haven’t played loads yet... but i'm gunna suggest my mates get this so we can all have a go.

-ve points

There are only 5 people on each side.

There could be more customisation/weapons to make the game more in depth.

There could be a chat function so users with microphones can communicate if they want too.

I would love to see swimming and parachutes... but maybe I am greedy!

It is difficult to get a game at this point in time... although I do realise this is brand new and not many people have got it yet. (hence I have no really factored this into my score)",Recommended,99,11

After watching BulletBarry play this game on more than one occasion, it looked like fun and I wanted to try it out for myself. I Must say the impression Barry's vids gave me is quite correct, it is fun indeed and I like the game.
This will become one of my go-to games when I just want to have fun and chill, Maybe I'll even get some copies for my friends in the future so we can get our own little funfight going on...

Even the devs surprised me, kudos are due for the swift respond I got on my question I posted in the discussions. Lots of devs leave their customers simmer in the discussions limbo, but not here, I got a response within the first 24 hours of posting it.

This is one of the few games that has surprised me in the last years and it certainly deserves a try, I bet you'll love it, if only for the great setting that it provides...

Pros:

+ Nostalgia
+ Graphics and attention to details is top notch
+ Sounds are good
+ Maps are amazing


Cons:

- Multiplayer only
- Slim to no games
- No bots

The Mean Greens – Plastic Warfare reminds me a lot about Army Men back in the day. The concept, the graphics, sounds, and most importantly the maps make this game a childhood memory that has come back from the plastic graveyard. The graphics is using the Unreal 4 Engine, and then the attention to details on the army men, maps, and background are all done very well. The sounds and music fit the theme perfectly. The UI is simple and clean – ammo, objective status, health, etc. The gameplay is smooth and feels similar to the old CoD titles but with a 3rd person view.

You also have a variety of guns, but some of those guns are in need of a tweak (either buff or nerf). You can use the environment to eliminate your opponents. For an example, you can use the foosball to run someone over with it while making a score for your team. Another map has cars racing around and you can bait them (the enemy) onto the track and watch them get flown off the table.

Unfortunately, the game is multiplayer only and finding a game is pretty much slim to none. When I did manage to find a game, it was smooth and I didn’t notice any lag/disconnects. I’ve heard of some players doing special events or scheduled days to play this game so that way people can actually have a full-fledged match going on. Adding bots could help out the multiplayer scene. If someone is playing with bots and someone joins their game, they are then placed on the opposite team and they replace one of those bots. When someone else joins the game, then they join one of the teams and replaces a bot; etc.",Recommended,37 people found this review helpful 0,0

For old school gamers who played the old Army Men games, this feels like the online spiritual successor to Sarges Heroes 2, minus the campaign, witty dialogue, and comical antics for single player. However, for an online game it's really fun. The maps are fun and creative, there's a nice mixture of childlike whimsy with level design, and the fact you can be snipped accross a table in an instant. It has the old Army Men level design feel into it. Every map has an objective and there's always something intersting about the map, (from the really fun soccer ball game level to the really annoying graveyard level.)

I love this game. I'm addicted to this game. It's far from perfect, but its gameplay is top notch, and if you put the time in, your reward in skill gained pays off. The maps are all extremely imaginative and feature many different game types/modes. The graphics and music are high quality and and supplement the gameplay well. There is no single player (besides a tutorial), no bots, no progression, and a fairly sparse player base at times. I would love all of those things to be better in the future, but for now, this game still stands out as the best online TPS ever to me, and it's the only one I really play. The dev team continues to be active in improving upon the game and adding more content, so I have nominated it for ""The Labor Of Love"" award. (2017, 2018, and 2020) Pick the game up if competitive gameplay appeals to you and you are willing to boot it up now and again to see if there's a match going. It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun.

The developers have recently stated that bots and some sort of ranking/progression system are both coming in the near future! It's a great time to buy if you've been on the fence on whether to purchase or not.

Edit 2: Bots for deathmatch and team deathmatch modes are in! They are a bit limited as they will only use the assault rifle or grenades and only work on the aforementioned modes, but they have good aim and react well enough to have a decent K/D when filling in slots online. They are a bit goofy and can be countered by a skilled player to moderate success. I don't think you're going to have a very fun time playing alone against a full match against bots, but it is possible and a nice option to have. Even if the game is empty of real players, you might end up playing with some other actual players eventually if you host your own server, because the server browser is back, both Steam and in game. When players join a match with bots, the bot slots are replaced by players, and there is one community server with no bots allowed.

In addition, cosmetic ranks are in, which is a cool small thing to reward no lifing like I do and racking up tons of hours. The ranks show a picture next to your name in lobbies and team lists in game. Your rank can only increase on official servers, and you get XP from kills and objectives at the end of a match. Because of this lack of progression on them, player hosted servers are ""just for fun"" in a way, and there are servers that allow for more players (20, 40, or otherwise) rather than the game's default 10 player design and limit. These big servers are a fun distraction, but don't all feel great due to an obvious lack of balancing. Unfortunately, ranks may even be tied specifically to region servers, rather than all official servers, (or there is a bug), because I only see my high rank on U.S. servers and it's back at the initial rank and never progresses on European servers. Along with the ranks are experience/kill count leaderboards, but surprisingly not one for K/D or any other purely skill based records, rather than just time spent playing in the long run. It would have been cool to have something more skill based like missions for rank, but it's not necessary. You can now also change and permanently set your soldier player model from a small set which even includes some new ones, yippee! There's even a set of ""new"" maps that are remixes of old maps with different layouts/obstacles and objectives. It's all new versions of Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch/Capture The Flag, and it's really great to have a bigger selection of both types of deathmatches while playing with bots. The map count was already impressive, but now it's almost excessive, and the development team seems committed to continuing to update the bots and add more maps/game modes.

Overall, the last big update with bots and ranks (and character selection and ""new"" maps) makes this game worth the purchase full price and without a doubt if/when on sale, but it must be said that the online is often pretty devoid of players when at non peak times, which even then is only usually one full match, or rarely, two. This game has sold one million copies on Steam, so it's sad to see that a lack of these recently added features early on may have contributed to difficulties cementing a player base that sticks around and plays often. If you can deal with playing with friends or bots only, as well using the Steam and in game server browser to check at different times throughout the day/week if people are playing, (or check official Discord/forums for times), you will get your money's worth on this title in the quality of gameplay alone. Grab you and your friends a few copies of the game in the Steam Summer Sale, (going on at the time on this writing), and wreck some plastic! I'll see you on the battlefield!",Recommended,19 people found this review helpful 2,0

[English Review] (Not my mother language so... sorry if i miss something)
The idea of the game is pretty good and seems to be fun to play with friends, the problem is... THE GAME IS DEAD, nobody is playing and that is a BIG problem, you enter to a match where only 4 persons are playing (actually just 1 puts effort in the game xD). I think that the game should be Free to play so people catch interest in. I repeat, the idea and gamemodes seems cool and interesting, but if no one is playing... makes no sense toa MULTIPLAYER game.

[Spanish review]
La idea es muy buena y parece super entretenido para jugar con amigos un rato, pero el juego esta muerto, casi nadie esta jugando y eso le quita muchisimo interes, entrar a partidas que se supone podrian ser para 20 personas y que solo haya 4 de los cuales uno solo le pone ganas. Creo que para que mejore deberia ser Free to Play. Repito, la idea y los modos del juego estan muy buenas e interesantes, pero si no hay nadie jugando... un juego MULTIJUGADOR deja de tener sentido.",Not Recommended,56,5

Purchased this when on sale back in 2019. Played it with friends for a total of around 80 minutes. It was good fun, but that's all I ever got out of it. The game is now more than six years old... It's probably ok for it at this point to be suffering from reduced player numbers.

But that's probably not good enough reason to downvote the game. Games have a life-cycle, technology moves on. It is a good fun game, more fun with your friends, but there are now other titles which are just as good, if not better... Go try some of those.",Recommended,19 people found this review helpful 1,0

The game is good, I bought it for 0.81 euro and I think I would be okay even paying the full price for it.

You will see other people complain about it having a tiny userbase. That is true, but for me this is not a serious issue because I played with the bots and it was fun. They are not very intelligent bots, they are at the same level of the old Unreal Tournament games. They run around and shoot whatever enemies they see. It's okay for me, I bought this game to have fun not to challenge myself.

Awesome TPS reminiscent of the old Army Men games. Design and stage aesthetics are incredible, gameplay...less so. Not that it's particularly bad, it just doesn't live up to the inspired art direction. Maps feel large and varied, but most are linear without forwarding spawn points, which leads to a lot of stalemates on objective-based maps.

For me, the clear passion and inspiration that went into the stages and throwback gameplay were worth the price of admission. There are no loadouts, classes, or levelling systems. Just dead-simple, fun Green vs. Tan gameplay.

As an addendum, developers are set to add at least 10 (!!!) more maps, along with gameplay tweaking as time goes on. I still think it's worth the asking price but, if you're looking for more, they're apparently looking to deliver.",Recommended,20 people found this review helpful 1,0

If you've ever played any of the armymen games by 3DO, this tops every last one of them.
Game feel changes from TF2, to Quake, to GUNZ the Duel, and even Mario Party across maps.

Easily the nicest looking game I've played this year too.
Physical Based Rendering done right in every possible way, realtime reflections, motion blur.
If Hitscan sniping is your fancy they have that too and it's pretty damn solid.

Genna plays The Mean Greens. A shooter where you play as plastic toy soldiers in unique and colourful maps. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...

The fact that you play as toys in this game allows for some really imaginitve objectives and maps.
For example, a kitchen map has you zipline in by a string attached to plastic cups. You battle in between gigantic doughnuts, bubbles from a sink, and your mission is to knock over the enemy cup so that they can't zipline into the level anymore. There are so many creative objectives placed on colourful and alive maps. It's a nice breath of fresh air in the shooter genre.

The gameplay itself is quite simple. You sprint, jump, shoot and roll. The combat at the moment isn't very in-depth. There are no weapon pick-ups, you just have all 5 on you at once. No killstreak rewards, or class systems. Personally, I like it. It's very simple and easy to pick up and have fun with. My only gripe at the moment is the game's cap is 5 vs 5 which leaves some of the bigger maps feeling a tad bit empty sometimes, although the devs have said they plan to raise that, as well as add more content in the future, which is great to hear!

That's really all there is to say.
Overall, simple gameplay but the fun variety of objectives and maps keeps the game fresh!",Recommended,48,2

The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is such a fun game and it's design is so charming I can't deny that much work went into the game, but sadly this games community is dead or dying fast at least.

The Mean Greens is a multiplayer shooter where you play as Toy Soldiers on maps which are designed to make you feel like a real toy. Like maps in a bathtub, art table, christmas tree and a birthday party.

The overall design of this game is absolutely amazing and it's charming to say the least. But the game has many faults.

First of all each map has a different game mode, so if you like a game mode like capture to flag you can only play on the map that has it. So if you don't like the map with Capture the Flag, well too bad you can't play it on any other map.

The gameplay itself is sometimes flawed. The game gives you five weapons a rifle, a sniper, shotgun, flamethrower and a rocket launcher. The problem is the rocket launcher and flamethrower aren't that good against enemies, so it boils down to the three mains.

The hit detection is another problem. While I didn't encounter it with any of the weapons expect the shotgun, it still annoyed me so much so that the only weapon I used was the rifle.

Graphically the game looks amazing. Every map looks colorful and vibrant and overall it's very pleasing to the eye.

This game also could use something like a level up system or ranks, cause to be completely honest playing a multiplayer game where your skill isn't rewarded at least for me isn't that fun. I would like to gain XP and earn something out of playing the game.

Overall The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is an incredibly fun game, but the problems and the dying community doesn't help at all and my honest suggestion is either skip on get it on a very heavy discount.

Pros:
+ Amazing Map Designs
+ Great game modes

Cons:
- Serious gameplay issues
- Dying community
- No level system makes the game unrewarding in a sense

I was interested in this game ever since I saw it being played by a YouTuber. It looked really good and fun and reminded of other games similar to it.
But after purchasing the game I found out that there isn't anyone playing this game at all.
So I haven't even been able to play at all. All I have experienced is the menu screens. What a dissapointment.

How can I recommend a game where the online community for this game is non-existent? Especially when it's what the game is all about. Now I read that the gamers do play at certain time on any given day. However, this is rather inconvenient for me and I'm sure it's to other gamers as well. Games like these that don't have the ability to play with bots can't survive that well when there are so many other choices out there on Steam.

At the moment, the game is just taking up space in my SSD. Precious space that could be used for a game that actually has people playing online(at all times), has a campaign, or practice with bots.


Definitly Not recommended and I will be getting a refund.

Introduction:
‘The Mean Greens – Plastic Warfare’ is a 5v5 competitive multiplayer team based game where you control one of the toy soldiers while fighting for various objectives on multiple stylish maps. Game itself seem to revolve around ‘Army Men’ universe, so those of you who played it back in the days will recognize it rather quickly and get that nostalgia feeling.

Few words about game universe:
For those of you who have never heard of ‘Army men’ franchise, here’s a short briefing: Game line is based around multiple toy soldier factions, who are divided by their color. It is somewhat humorous and satiric universe which depicts military conflicts in our common surroundings, like your average children’s room, or toy railway with train on it, etc.

Unfortunately, even though initial idea is interesting on paper, game line didn’t seem to catch attention of people and was a commercial failure. That, however, doesn’t mean that universe is entirely dead, as we still have games like “The Mean Greens” and open source remaining of “Army men 3” which, sadly, stopped its development in April 2018.

Gameplay-wise ‘The Mean Greens’ is an oldschool team based shooter where you can either take steady aim, or just randomly hop’n’shoot, taking out your enemies while trying to complete map objective. There are 5 types of weapons overall and you carry all of them straight after spawn. Each weapon is very specific and only works for specific goals: e.g. It’s useless trying to shoot at someone with a shotgun if they stand farther than 10 meters away from you, e.t.c.

It’s worth mentioning that ‘The Mean Greens’ features multiple gamemodes: In one of them you have to melt your dinosaur faster than enemy team melts theirs, in another you have to drag and drop the cup from the table faster than rivals and that’s not counting quite standard modes, like team Deathmatch and Capture the flag, which look quite dull comparing to previous examples.

Map designers deserve a cookie, as all of the game levels look unique, stylish, colorful and, most importantly, unrepetitive: One battlefield features underwater fights inside some aquarium, with fishes calmly swimming around you, while another map represents huge birthday cake where you have to light up birthday candles. Even tutorial is made via interesting way where players have to guess how certain things work.

Visuals of the game were already partially covered in a previous section, however it’s still worth mentioning that game is made on Unreal Engine 4, which basically guarantees top quality picture. Each model looks on a decent level. Overall gamma is quite bright and colorful, which can literally cheer you up if you’re in a bad mood.

However, if you’re still sad, even after seeing all these colorful places, plunging you in the childhood, the music will totally help you. Seriously, if there’s one thing that is done better than visuals, it is the music. Each map and menu features unique melody which suits funky combat just fine and can be listened to, even without the game. Composers did amazing job here!

















Overall ‘The Mean Greens’ is a game with great potential, yet somewhat poor realization of of some quite vital things. It could be a really popular game, but messed up server list ruins most of it. Can I recommend it overall, though? It’s more of a YES than NO game. Especially since you actually can have some fun if you gather up together with your friends and invite them to your own server. Things might change for the better once devs finally release bot support, so keep your eyes peeled to the news!",Recommended,15 people found this review helpful 0,3

This game looks incredible! All the visuals are so good and the aesthetic and all the looks about it are just perfect! The gameplay... it could use some fixin' up.

Although the game looks stunning when you actually play it you notice quite a few issues with it, here are the ones I have found so far:

40% of the time when someone shoots you there is no way of telling you have been shot, your health goes down but there is no red semi circle or even sound effect. The circle appears sometimes and I can't even tell if there is a sound effect for being shot.
The flamethrowers are way way too op. Maybe they're supposed to be a replacement for the knife but at close range they can kill you in less than half a second before you even have time to react, the gamemodes where its hard to be a flamethrowing ♥♥♥♥♥ are the best.
EXAMPLE: I was playing a CTF and on the other team there was a guy who kept using a flamethrower, by the end of the game no one even got to their flag as flamethrowers were camping there and our team managed to kill off the 2 people that actually tried to get our flag. The end results show the flamethrower guy had 32 kills 2 deaths and his other team members combined had about 7 kills (three other people). Our team of also four people had combined kills of about 20 or less. FIX THE FLAMETHROWERS PLEASE

Last of all I just want to say that the last time I played this game there were about 4 flamethrower guys in my server and I just got so fed up of jumping server to server just to find some honest people who actually use real guns that don't have infinite ammo :l and therefore I don't even want to play this game anymore until they do something about it.

I'm not crying about being a n00b, I'm just pointing out an easy exploit that ruins the spirit of the game for me. I will upvote this game but only because I do actually like the game; 40% of the players? Not so much.",Recommended,19,0

Plastic soldiers you say? Well, why not, it's not like this is the first time game used those. Suddenly an onslaught of soldiers looks kind of cute, instead of severed limbs you get shattered plastic and there is no blood. So apart from the theme, what is this all about? The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is a multiplayer third person shooter in which two sides of plastic soldiers, greens and tans, fight on a variety of über cute maps with their plastic arsenal.

Each side can have five soldiers at most and while you cannot pick different types of little warriors, you can pick from a variety of weapons to use. Each soldier carries an M4, sniper riflle, shotgun, rocket launcher and flamethrower from which you can choose on the go. Have you used all your sniper rifle ammo? No problem, take out your shot gun and run around for a moment while your ammo gets automatically replenished, that is if you live long enough. I would say that neither of these weapons is weaker than others maybe apart from rocket launcher; which however can fire just one rocket before having to replenish ammo. The gun handling itself is far from being unique as it is very arcade like, fitting with the theme of the game I would say. If you are a fan of realism... well, you would not be even reading this review so whatever.

Soldiers can duke it out on an astounding number of 10 maps (hi SW) each equipped with a different mode ranging from typical deatch match and capture the flag to candle lighting on a birthday party. The theme of the game let the devs to come up with some really unique arenas for the soldiers to fight in which is in my opinion the biggest perk of the game. Who would not enjoy a ride on a toy train around a christmas tree or an onslaught inside a Foosball. When you are riding a little gummy duck inside a bathtub you won't even care that the graphics are not exactly perfect and some textures could use a little more work which brings me to the next part of this review, graphics.

As I have said, the game is not the ""bestest"" looker on the market, devs of The Mean Greens tried to bring us a fully 3D experience and as many small indie studios kinda struggle with the delivery; However for what it is, the game is pleasant to look at. It is very colorful and one will forgive it the sometimes too rough edges and blurry textures. From a technical standpoint the game runs fine and I did not notice any major hiccups on an upper mid-end desktop. In settings there are plenty of options to fiddle with while trying to get a better performance from a lower end machine.

All in all, The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare is a pretty decent game which cannot, and in my opinuon should not, compete with the popular shooters like CS:GO or Overwatch; However in itself can bring a lot of joy if you are a fan of arcade shooting in an unique arenas while listening to a pretty neat soundtrack. The main question will be whether it can keep the servers running and populated and for how long. So should you buy it? For 10 bucks it is not a bad deal whether you are bored of competitive shooters and want to relax or want a not so brutal game for your young ones so feel free to grab it, it works and it's fun!",Recommended,21 people found this review helpful 0,0

+ The level design is incredible. Highly detailed and very creative. Each level takes place in a room of a house that is decorated with toys and a variety of unique structures that I found to be a joy to explore.
+ Lots of unique and surprisingly fun game modes. Things like ""Melt the Ice with your flamethrower and free your dinosaur before the enemy"" was one of my favorite.
+ I felt like the gameplay was decently fun, although fairly simplistic for a shooter and I personally experienced a small bit of lag.

- I felt like death came far too quickly. Every weapon seems to be able to kill someone in 1-3 shots which felt unfair at times as you can easily shoot people across the map. Especially considering that you start with every weapon in the game including the sniper.
- No bots. If you can't find a game you literally can not play the game unfortunetely.",Recommended,21,0

If you loved Army Men, this is a gem for you ^^

Only thing I found not liking in this game, is that it is too fast-paced for my taste, its reducing me time to enjoy maps and surroundings.

Beside that graphicly textures and models are awesome!
Sound effects and music well made, cant complain in any way.
Gameplay....It's ARMY MEN it brings instant flash-back from the past, and it can never get old and borring. Good variety of maps and game mods will keep you running it for a long long time, especialy if you get some of your friends to play with you.


Overall;
A very quality and fun game, safely recommended to every-day gamers.",Recommended,73,3

k.... it says i got 30 minutes at time of review and yes that's true. XP

However, I surprised by this.
First, not sure how many of you had a N64 and Army Men Sarge's Heros. This is exactly like that for the most part. Shooter themed around army men toy soldier.s. Pretty much what this game boils down to. Difference being this is only multiplayer. That's ok.
you can tell it's a low budget game. For it being that it is much better than similar low budget games.

The graphics are nice and clean. Everything runs smooth and seamless.

low point is. it being what it is. there's not many people on the servers.
However, there was enough I was able to play a few matches in my short time playing.
Which brings me to my point that i could see myself playing this more.. If only to play a few quick matches. while something else downloads or i'm cooking.

if it's on sale grab it like i did. 2 bucks.",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 0,0

I know what you're asking, is it like the Army Men games?

Well, not 100% quite. It is a good game, however. It's like the Army Men series, but a bit faster paced. There is no single player, there is no bots, and there isn't weapon pick ups or drops or the likes. You start out with all the weapons and they're poorly balanced.

The shotgun really out shines the main rifle, or all the weapons really. The flame thrower is a tad underwhelming and I find the reach is dreadful making it the worse weapon in the game. This balance can really ruin the game for some players. I also find the rocket launcher a bit too powerful as well, but it isn't like you have a whole lot of shots with it, so it isn't a strong complaint from me.

Though you will not get 5v5 games often, I did just finish a 3v3 game. I do not understand how this game got so many negative reviews for being dead when there is plenty of games being hosted occupied by players. It's not like it was designed for 32v32, you'll get a full game or near full game if you try.

The biggest complaint I have is level variety. You have a handful of levels that have, set in stone, only one mode of play. This means you can only play one level for capture the flag, only one level for free for all deathmatch, only one level for team death match, etc. The question is... why? Not only is it lacking levels, but it's lacking levels for game modes. It could easily implement the majority of modes on all the maps, but that isn't the case.

Ultimately, this is a fine game if you can get it on the cheap. It has great potential and I hope the developer can take advantage of it. It really could make a good Army Men series tribute, or reincarnation really.

Pros:
Nostalgia exploitation but satisfying
Good fast gameplay, easy to pick up and learn, good game to play every once in awhile with friends
Well made maps, all good looking
game modes creative and enjoyable, very refreshing, though some feel slightly similar to existing ones.
This game is still worked on frequent enough to not feel alarmed about the investment.

cons:
Dreadful balance system.
No auto balance, no option to join losing team in game, cannot switch teams when ""game is about to start.""
No single player, no campaign, no bots, nothing beyond PvP.
The crosshair is not perfectly reliable when used for aiming during situations where you might be behind cover; this is a common problem for other third person shooters as wel, consider this a nitpick.
Weapons don't always fire where you witness the actual gun pointing, this is especially noticable with the flame thrower.
Lacks a huge amount of variety in weapons, levels, gameplay, and many other pieces of content that can cause this game to have virtually no replay value in the long run. You're better off playing with friends an Army Men game emulator, even despite this being the newer take on the series.


Overall, I say 7.5/10 is deserved. Good game, buy it if you got a solid group of friends.

If the game were to ever develop bots and AI, this game has A LOT of potential to be a must have game for a group of friends. Whether it was to make a good campaign/coop mode, or perhaps a mode where all players fight a giant toy dinosaur or such, the potential is endless. The developers are currently looking into AI, but the results or implementation remains a mystery as of now.

To Developer:
This game needs
More weapons, see Army Men series for more. From mines and minesweeper to grenade launchers, you have options.
Vehicles and Aircraft. It doesn't have to be forced on all maps, but I do suggest you implement them in some maps for the sake of variety.
Make flexible game modes available on all maps (free for all death match, team death match, capture the flag, etc.)

The Mean Greens is a pretty solid and imaginative shooter multiplayer game (which was obviously inspired by the Army Men series of games), which at some point seems to have sold over 1 million copies. Unfortunately, online multiplayer is pretty much dead nowadays. I was able to find a match with three other people... but that's a rare occurrence.

It seems the game does have bots you can play against, but it doesn't provide a straightforward way of just setting up a match with bots under your desired game mode, which is a shame. It should just offer a simple ""Play against bots"" option. Also, the game does offer a short tutorial to teach you the basics of how to play, which is appreciated.

So, although The Mean Greens is pretty much dead, and it will most likely not receive any more updates, I DO recommend it if:

- You have friends to play with

- Wait to get it with a 90%+ discount

At this point, the devs should just make the game free to play to attract more players, maybe open up a Patreon or something similar for it, and advertise a Discord community so fans of the game can find each other, and set up more regular playing sessions.

Additionally, for anyone who marks reviews they dislike and/or disagree with as ""funny"", when the review in question is not humorous: Doing that is , and doesn't make your opinion the right one :)",Recommended,12,0

This game definitely needs more people.

The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare harkens back to a time when games had higher standards, a time that lived its' last days perhaps a decade ago or so.
When you get this game, you'll see that everything's in there already. Very few modifications or fixes need to be done. It has that rare combination of fun gameplay, fine graphics, clever map concepts, and epic soundtrack (the soundtrack is extremely catchy and was composed by three different people, which brings a harmonious variety of music genres into the fold). This is a stark contrast to the current blockbuster games which attract large numbers of buyers whilst [initially] containing very limited content.

The major curse that has befallen this game is precisely one of numbers. Namely, too few people are playing it. This makes most parties pretty much empty. And yet, the game is still enjoyable enough to be played in a 3v3 scuffle. I see that most buyers have resorted to handing out negative reviews because of that, and this is hardly fair in my book. The devs should consider introducing bots to keep the game on its' toes for what it's worth. does that, so why shouldn't they?

What can I say? This game surely stands out in several ways. I wouldn't necessarily say that it is an underrated game, but it cruelly suffers from undeserved neglect instead.

If you enjoyed , then you'll definitely enjoy .",Recommended,12 people found this review helpful 0,1

This game sure has some downsides. Still. But the best thing is that devs who doesn't seem to be a large group of people are still working on the game and try to stay in touch with the community at the game-related forums. They greatly appreciate players' feedback and seem to encourage it. That is what I really like.

So, What is ""The Mean Greens""? Well, It's a third-person multiplayer shooter based on the UNREAL engine, featuring, as might already know, toy soldiers. Gameplay is quite simple, but this simplicity somehow makes this game even more fun. Basically, It's just simple toy-styled game where you can just play and relax in the end of the day. Of course, there are different gamemodes and maps, and, talking about maps, they are very well designed, colorful and full of decorations. Graphics is nice, however, there are some texture pop-ups, but they are not very annoying. Another good point is that game runs nice on my aged hardware (AMD Athlon II X4, 4gb ram, XFX Radeon HD 7750 (1gb vram)). There are some troubles with connecting to servers, but most of them are already fixed.
All in all, The Mean Greens is quite simple but solid game which can bring your childhood back to life. You should definately buy it when it's on sale.",Recommended,13,0

The Mean Greens is a solid concept that turned into a half-baked game.

The music and environments give the game a polished veneer but the underlying gameplay is stale. Fast movement speed combined with rudimentary physics and piss-poor hit detection makes the gun battles schizophrenic and unsatisfying. If you still want to give it a try, good luck finding a single populated server. As of this writing, there are usually fewer than ten people playing globally at any given time.

Taking up the mantle of the Army Men series that's been dormant for 10+ years, The Mean Greens is a casual multiplayer third person shooter in which you play as a toy soldier fighting to secure victory for either the tan or green team. This take on toy soldiers is much more lighthearted than something like Sarge's Heroes on the Dreamcast as you'll be playing in recreations of everyday settings such as living rooms and kitchens while listening to some really charming, cheery music evocative of things like Toy Story play in the background. There are lots of well detailed maps to play on and fun spins on old game modes such as a Payload-esque mode where you escort a hamster in a ball into its cage while defending it from the enemy, or a full size foosball match where you must kick the ball into your opponents' goal. Everything looks great and it really gives this whimsical feeling that no other multiplayer shooter does.

However, there are some sort of strange design choices or afterthoughts that sort of bug me. As far as I'm aware there is no way to switch teams in the game which is killer for a small game like this you and your friends pick up to play together. Also, you start every game with all 5 weapons available to you as soon as you spawn and their ammo replenishes on a cooldown system. An interesting idea for sure, but just sort of strange. How many games let you start out with a sniper rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher, and flamethrower right from the get go? Not necessarily a negative, but it felt like there was nothing to find on the map, no weapons to get excited about or things to unlock. One thing that sort of bugged me was how your soldier just gets shot so unceremoniously. No reaction from him, no gun sway applied to you, and then you just die a quiet death. I guess they're toys so it makes sense but it just comes off feeling unpolished.

Overall for 5$ (Even as low as 99 cents on sale) it's a fun game to hop on with your friends from time to time. There are developers spending millions of dollars and years and years developing games like this so at its best it's a fun diversion to your main stable of games, but the aesthetics and music give a fun vibe that I haven't seen in a shooter like this in a while. Plus, how many shooters can you play giant foosball in while you kill your enemies?",Recommended,14,0

While this game is by no means perfect and could use improvement, I feel like it does its job pretty well for what it is supposed to be as well as its price. Not only that, but I feel like playing this game as a group of friends makes the experience all the more entertaining when all of you are bored and just want some casual quick fun. Taking one quick look at it can easily remind one of Toy Story, Army Men and the Pixar-esque soundtrack just helps reinforce this feeling as well, certainly suggested for anyone looking for a game that's goofy, completely casual and not complex at all. It is visually creative, despite not being the first one at doing what it shows in the game, and the graphics mixed with the soundtrack, gameplay as well as the fact it is a third person shooter just makes it entertaining enough. If you manage to pick it up during the Steam sales and you have friends you could play it with, you and your friends could pick it up and play together; So far that's what I've done myself.

=On short=

Pros: Cheap, casual fun, potential to be replayed every now and then, interesting visuals and music choices, super fun with friends, a game that's both easy to pick up and enjoy, regular updates and devs that are so far open-minded about their game, regular sales for the game, plenty of potential, fun to explore and look at maps.

Cons: Needs an option to let you set your language manually in the options (some non-english speakers may prefer the original english text), a few translations of the game are not really correct, toxic community, cheaters appear every now and then (thankfully there's a votekick option, though, so not too bad)

But The maps are just so awful, They look nice but thats about it. They're extremely linear and most games end up being a stalemate. The maps are essentially giant choke points and they get pretty boring rather quickly. Id like to see the devs update the current maps with alternate routes. Like for example with the bathtub map allow us to get on the walls of the tub, or maybe add a shower curtain for us to run or climb up to the bar that holds it up. Maybe the devs could make new maps that are more complex, release a few for free and sell the rest as a map pack. Im gonna give the game a 6/10 and I really feel like the maps keep this game from being great.",Not Recommended,27,0

The game with probably the worst selling title you can find but its fun, so much fun
More maps than Starwars Battlefront, all with their own unique mode, vibe and OST (wich is really good btw)

However, there are also issues, you mostly don't know you're getting hit, playercount is a tad low tnx to barely any advertising and some map balance issues (there is a map with boats that circle just to one direction wich is really predictable)",Recommended,22,3

After just 10minutes on this game, I am enjoying it so much I laugh and cannot stop!

Graphics: The graphics use the UE4 engine and are very pretty to look out, depending on the map! Maxed out it is super smooth, no glitches for me or a single bug. Very optimised and impressive for this little game.

Audio: The audio is deeply enjoyable too. It all depends on the map you are given! Example a Christmas map plays Christmas music.. A birthday map plays birthday music and the gun sounds do sound like toys. Very enjoyable soundtrack.

Controls: The controls are so simple to use, it makes the game super easy to pickup, play and go! Cannot complain!

Gameplay: The gameplay features a decent amount of style to the game, from pushing a cup off the edge, to lighing birthday candles, then some TDM modes, but to date of this review being wrote there is not much actual maps.. Also there are not many people actually play. The max I seen in a server was 6 people, some people kept joining but never stayed long.. The game needs more people, it needs more maps... I cannot complain about it, just the community needs to go and it needs more maps. Otherwise running around as a tiny army man is enjoyable in a huge scale world!

Would I recommend this game? Yes. It is cheap and deeply enjoyable multiplayer!",Recommended,7 people found this review helpful 0,0

When you have devs who can only say 'we totally have stuff coming soon' and never deliver stuff that is needed...your game will die. This game is dead, look at the pro reviews, notice how they even say that? Take the hint, don't buy this dead fish.

First, go check The Mean Greens steam db stats. You can clearly see when this game was in the humble bundle and how quickly(literally, within a week) the players left. Also you can see when this game had 600ish players...that also mostly left within 1 week.

Now that you can see that people have played the game and left quickly, lets get into why:

Little to no customization - Nothing to customize...no kits to make...nothing to make you any different than everyone else that plays. You don't even get to pick which kind of army man you are.

Weapons - You are given all the weapons from the get-go, pretty sure there is still 6 weapons, that is it. Nothing to work towards, everyone else has the exact same few weapons, no customization for the weapons, no skins...literally...nothing.

No skill levels or rank difference - this is a multi-part issue. Some of it can't be solved because the devs refuse to add what was needed from day 1, some of it is because the lack of players. There is ZERO type of ranking, match-making(other than the pathetically poor, REALLY pathetically poor 'join a game') or any other type of placement. If you DO get into a game, good chance there will be a good player on 1 team just dominating. That is no fun, not even a little.

No bots - For a dead game(yes dead, taking 12 months to get above 70 players during PEAK time is dead, go ahead and check, Dec 26th 2016 was the last time it had 70+ players other than just the other day) this is the worst decision, ever. No idea why there was no bots added in from the get-go. IF you get into a game, chances are it won't be close to full, if you can even get into a game when people are on.

No single player - This game is F'ing dead, and yet the devs don't want to release any single player. So...YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO PLAY. Literally. If no one is on to match into a 2-3 player game with(yeah...no one to match so no one to fill games) then you don't play, simple as that. Do you really want to buy a game that you can't play?

Lackluster devs - This one is a tough one. The devs have made 2 new maps since I bought the game...yet that is it. They KNOW it is dead and they need to do something...for some reason why that something hasn't been bots, single player, customization or any type of MM. The only thing they can say is 'totes have stuff coming soon, can't say when and can't say what...but totally believe us, even though we haven't done anything that has been needed in over 12 months, but we totally will deliver this time.'. They have been told, several times, but A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE GAME, the issues and what is needed. It falls on deaf ears and is met with 'oh we totes will do that someday'.

All-in-all I can't recommend this game to others. Dead game(check steam stats, don't take my word for it, see the pathetic player # yourself) add in no single player and no bots...that right there means NO PLAYING THE GAME(how da ♥♥♥ do the devs not understand this but keep saying 'we totally wish we could fix the playerbase count). No customization and no type of bracket/skill level difference to put the newbs with the newbs and leave the pros to their own kind.

If the devs actually fix the issues with this game and quit releasing something 'just to look nice'(2 new maps...that is it, but no bots, no single player, no customization, no ranking...not a dang thing to actually fix the game. A polished dead fish, is still a dead fish) then I will change this review, until then...I can't(and no one should, take that into account when reading the pro-reviews, notice how half of them mention it is dead...but they thumbs up...yeah...buy a dead game...) recommend a dead game to anybody, it is skeezy and sleezy to do.",Not Recommended,53,0

There’s a lot to be impressed by in The Mean Greens; Plastic Warfare. This thought began to occur to me when, after a good 15 to 20 minutes of waiting in the multiplayer lobby with no other players in sight, I began to realise how perfectly cheesy the music playing in the background was. It’s a delightful medley, one perfectly suited to taking pride of place in any respectable escalator, even down to the way it’s instantly forgettable from the moment you walk away. As time went by and many more minutes passed without a soul to be seen, it’s perhaps the only thing that kept me sane in those intensely dark moments of loneliness.

There were other things that did a great job at maintaining my sanity, however. The colourful menu screens were also helpful; the perfect tease for the vibrancy and craziness I could expect to be thrown into, once I’d mastered the arcane magic required to summon people at will to actually play the game with me. It gave me the same pleasure as knowing there’s a cake waiting in the fridge for when you arrive home from work; that anticipation of knowing that there is something to look forward to in your future. The fact that your journey home takes 15 years and the fridge is permanently locked kind of puts a dampener on proceedings, but hey… At least you know there is the tiniest possibility of getting cake. Or actual gameplay. This metaphor might be getting a little confusing.

The unpredictability present in The Mean Greens was another fun factor that kept me on my toes, and not knowing what would happen when I tried to search for a match proved to be gripping stuff. I could end up actually finding a match (unlikely), find myself in yet another lobby, or even be met with a loading screen that looks like it's loading into a match, only to freeze and crash back to the main menu at a moment's notice. It all proved to be incredibly uncertain and exciting, something that not many other games could offer in the same weird way. It wasn’t just trying to find a match which created such spontaneous moments, either. Imagine my surprise and delight when I tried to set the game to windowed mode, only for the screen resolution to completely mess up as a result. It created a situation where I was completely unable to click on anything, and was therefore required to force quit to desktop. I never knew what was around the next corner!

Persevere with this randomness for long enough, however, and with a little luck you might be placed into an actual match with a smattering of other desperate players – all of you finally free to play the game you’ve paid for. Unfortunately, this is where things kind of start to fall apart, because the gameplay just isn’t very fun. Take a good minute or so it to digest the poor quality soundtrack constantly on loop in the background, and then another minute to scour the map and find someone to shoot at, and you’ll soon realise that combat fails to provide any satisfaction.

For instance - shooting your gun doesn’t have any weight or sense of impact to it, making you feel as if you’re shooting marshmallows rather than bullets, and the simple task of knowing if you’re damaging someone or being damaged therefore becomes far more difficult than it has any right to be. Even getting a kill gives very little fanfare or rewards, therefore making all your efforts beforehand in taking the time to kill someone feel a little wasted. It’s disheartening, to say the least.

Each map being a different game mode is also a nice idea in theory, but for one reason or another simply doesn’t work when put into practice. There’s one mode that sees you capturing flags on a speeding toy train. This sounds exciting, but it fails to feel action packed in the slightest, due to the way every death puts you so far away from the action it can take upwards of a minute to actually get back to where you were. Another mode presents almost precisely the opposite problem; you’re meant to float on rubber ducks to capture flags, but considering you can pretty much see and snipe anywhere from the spawn area (Up to and including the other team’s spawn), there’s really no incentive to ever move from your starting position. On it goes, map after map, the sparse amount of players only making games drag out their limited welcome even further. It’s enough to make you long for the lobby screen again.

With all sincerity, however, let me close off this review with an observation; there’s nothing wrong with ambition. Indeed, the developers of The Mean Greens should be commended for taking on the challenge of a multiplayer only shooter, especially when you consider how saturated the market is with them. The problem comes in the fact that I simply can’t help but feel that there should have been a moment where a healthy dose of realism was infused into proceedings. There should have been a realisation that this game, even with all best wishes, could have ended up as the barren wasteland that is has turned out to be. Measures such as the inclusion of bots in the future may not save this game or even make it somewhat appealing again, but at least they would create something that's remotely playable playable. As it stands, however, this isn’t something that will keep you entertained.",Not Recommended,14,0

Currently, I do not recommend this game.

Seems like it's in Early Access and had to double-check - nope.

Once they fix the performace issues (input can be laggy to unresponsive, graphic settings must be dumbed down to actually be able to play on even a high-end system) this game may be worth playing.

I have to edit my review out of my respect for the developers, they turned a sour situation into a good one and did right by me.

I got this game at launch full price (I wanna say it was like, $20-25) and really enjoyed it despite the lack of polish and features, as well as the bugs and completely dead multiplayer. Understandably, seeing how the developers repeatedly failed to address the dead playerbase and breathe life into the game was really depressing, because then, as I still agree now, it has lots of potential.

Well, after leaving the game untouched for probably 2-3 years, I decided to give it a go again after I saw it was on sale on the home-page. Much to my surprise, the game has received some sorely needed polish and updates.

There are tons of new maps and game modes from the last time I played, the game plays buttery smooth, and best of all, the game has dedicated servers!

In the early days of this game's life cycle, the only way to play was to host your own server or join somebody elses-- so most of the time that meant you and a couple buddies would populate a server when you had time after work or on the weekends.

Now my biggest complaint has been addressed and while I am upset it took so long for it to happen, I will give credit to the dev team where it's due, because they've absolutely saved this game from certain doom.

This game is so much fun, especially in a 40 player match. This game has infinite replay value and as long as you have internet connection, you can play it to your heart's content.

Now, that being said, it's not perfect... controller support is native but not completely integrated in the game, and the weapon switching still feels too slow/broken to me. Playing with an Xbox controller for Windows feels a bit sluggish and unresponsive even with the sensitivity adjusted. I also think the M16 is a bit unfairly nerfed compared to the old game builds, and should have some add'l range especially considering it's quite literally hit or miss on the larger maps and there is no middle ground. I think the jump physics could use a hare of adjustment, or at least be adjustable on the server side. Having access to these sort of controls over the game as a host would be cool, maybe someday?

All in all, this is a completely fun and hilarious arena shooter that's 100% worth the price of admission!",Recommended,12,0

Update New: New cool stuff but no one to play with :(

Update: New Maps, New Gamemodes With Planes & Vehicles! & Server System Has Been Worked On - Update brought some people back to play, servers work and got a game within seconds, but still need a server browser, a way to check and join a server easily instead of using the auto matchmaking system, once that comes back or happens, and it works I can recommend it. If its on sale then its worth getting till its fixed but at full price at this time not so much.

Maybe along with the server browser in the next update allow people to host their own with mods & steam workshop maybe?

----------------------------------------

My Mean Greens Review:

Pros
- Graphics Amazing
- Gameplay VERY Fun
- Affordable at around $10-15
- Overall Tons of Fun (When the server stuff worked)
- VERY Nostalgic

Cons:
- Server Browser Broken for the life time of the game, it did not work
- Matchmaking system was broken too
- When you try to play you will either get an empty server or cannot connect at all!
- Slow Updates

(Keep in mind some of these cons have been fixed but too late, and there are still some issues)

The game amazing it had TONS of potential, level design was fantastic the game played really well and it was tons of fun when it did work with a full server
What pleauged the game was the lack of work and care taken for anything related to servers, connecting to the servers, the matchmaking system, the server browser that almost never worked

And that is why the game has got its current set of mixed reviews

If they want to bring this game back to life again like the amazing beautiful game that it is, the team has to put their ass into gear and fix the server issues already before its too late
and make it Free 2 Play, that could be another thing that could save this game if they fix the issue.

Another thing I have waited for and never happened yet is workshop maps, if that existed, man o man...

Anyways that is my review of the game as well some some other thoughts I wanted to get off my chest

Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics 10/10
Servers: 0.1/10

I bought this game because of the resemblance of Sarges Hero's of the N64 which I have fond memories of. This game is one of the best third person shooters on steam. The graphics are super polished, the gameplay is super fun, and the only thing negative I have to say is the community is a bit small. However you only need 10 players for a full game. Let's talk about gameplay.

There are different game modes. Some are like a game within a game lol. In one map you are in a foozball table playing a game of soccer while shooting eachother. In another game mode you are trying to summon a T-Rex by melting ice with your flame thrower. The guns are pretty cool too. M16, Sniper, Shotgun, Bazooka, you know... The classic All American Army arsenal. The game is the typical Army battle of green vs tan soldiers.

Do I reccomend? Absoluetly.

in the positive part it's a very fun game, if you ever played the old army men games and enjoyed them or you love playing as a toy soldier inside a kitchen or fridge or even a bathroom.. then there's a big chance you will enjoy it, the gameplay is fast and there's many maps with different objectives and on the graphics side it looks beautiful, still not sure why not many people are playing it, perhaps there's some game breaking bugs that I haven't encountered yet or there wasn't enough marketing, anyways i don't think you would go wrong by picking it up for $2 on sale especially if you want to have some great time with your friends :)",Recommended,6 people found this review helpful 0,2

UPDATE 7/20/17: They added two new maps that feature vehicles - one with jeeps/buggys, the other with airplanes. So far they seems like great additions to the game! They also nerfed the shotgun quite a bit so it is no longer the go-to weapon up close.

A fun and light-hearted shooter, worth every penny. The maps are well designed with a gamemode in mind, so there's no problem trying to adapt gamemodes to different maps where they may (or may not) work. The visual design is amazing and the skyboxes definitely make the illusion of being a toy soldier. Not to mention the soundtrack is AMAZING (its on iTunes). 10/10 would buy again!

Pro/Con List:

Pros:
-Great visual desgin
-Fun gamemodes
-Classes are balanced
-unique maps/gamemodes
-FANTASTIC Soundtrack

-Only 10(ish) maps
-Kitchen Run can be a clusterf**k

This game is great if you like playing with the little plastic army men as a kid or loved any of the Army Men series of games that came out way back. The downsides to this game are that there is no single player or even playing against bots, and nobody plays it online. I dont get why this game is so dead its beautiful the levels are well designed and the music is great. When i first got this game it was loads of fun to jump into a match and blast apart the enemy into bits of plastic or melt them with the flamethrower but now its just another game that sits in my library never to be played again, Even when using the steam server browser to find games and try to connect you usually cant.

Well that would be the players. You don't really see anybody ""playing"" this game. Online matches exist, but at the same time they don't. It's like a ghost town. You're forced to play bots or play with friends.

I like the concept of the game. Brings me back to when I played with the toy soldiers in the backyard. The maps are very well designed and the controls are easy enough to get a hold of. I may have only played less then an hours worth but I do recommend this game to people who want that nostalgia. Some of the games they have are entertaining. The Jurassic map I highly love. Who doesn't want to be a raptor and hunt everything down. The one Con I have with this game is the lack of players. Most if not all the servers are empty.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
[REVIEW UPDATE 2019] (excuse my spelling and grammar & strap in for a long review)

One of, if not the only game i will leave a review for because i like it so much !
This game has continued to grow on me despite playing since release.

There has been LOTS of big updates which has really flushed out the game and gives you countless reasons to keep playing.

The games Player base has tripled maybe even quadrupled since release.
Now daily having 800/900 and even 1000+ players on at a time,
filling up most of the servers. which is great!

==== WHAT I LOVE ====

There are a lot of different people to socialise with, have fun, make friends or getting help.
One of the best updates, Community workshop integration.
Allows for some serious player customisation with the use of Custom player models. With literally THOUSANDS of player models uploaded by the player base, and even more daily.
You can look how you want, be whoever you want to be and stand out from the crowd!

====================

The development team are constantly working on the game and fixing any major issues ASAP.

The latest HUGE update (7.0.0)
Added a whole new redesigned Plaza area
( which is where you will spend a majority of your time)

It is much more compact now but still plenty of room, enough to spend a good few hours exploring everything.
It is filled to the brim so there is plenty to do there.

-

There are a boat load of stores to spend your hard earned units on.
for player customisation, condo furniture or player accessories(held objects)

SO where do you get units to buy everything?

Well pretty much every type of game/minigames gives you way to earn money and the better you are the more money you will make !

You have repeating minigames on a designated open platform that everyone can take part in and try win, such as target practice, snowball fights, balloon popping and more!

You also have other game area's in the plaza such as;

- bowling which can take 4 people and integrated media players so you can bowl with your friends and listen to some music!

- laser tag, like the name suggests it's just like real life laser tag, two teams fight against one another in some laser warfare!

- casino where you can try your luck with already earned units and safely gamble for fun, with slot machines, poker, blackjack, spin to win wheels, the casino is a fun place to try get lucky

- arcade, currently a work in progress but will soon be released featuring classing arcade games like ski-ball, basketball games, whack a mole, air hockey and much much more

- trivia, again like the name suggests you can take part in trivia quizzes alone or with others to test your knowledge and earn money!

- typing derby, the last thing in the plaza specifically that you can earn money with, this is all about typing accurately but as fast as you can. the better you are the more units you will earn as always.

~
there are also a few more things to do like the Theatre to watch video's with large groups of people,

a rideable roller coaster & ferris wheel

burried tresure events and photoshoot spots to find around the map

*takes a breath*

==============================
7.0.0 Continued

As i said, this was a HUGE update but the best so far.

Along with everything we have went over this update ALSO added almost 400 steam Achievements and in game experience(levels) for everything that you can do.

So there is literally hundreds of goals to set yourself, and a lot of these take some real skill and dedication.

The plaza its self, along with games inside the plaza and other minigames all have their own achievements and exp(levels)
which can unlock you unique-
cosmetics, held items, trophies, badges and furniture

There are a lot of these new unique items and they all take a long amount of time to unlock them.
These are my personal favourite additions and what i have been trying to unlock and collect as much as i can!

=== Lets wrap it up ===

There is plenty plenty more i could talk about but i will just glaze over the rest as this review is long enough.

There are condos(houses) you can decorate to your hearts desire

More flushed out games you can play-
Minigolf, Ball race, virus, zombie massacre, little crusaders, planet panic
(with more to come in the future such as racing these are some of the best ways to earn units/money)

====== WHAT I DON'T LIKE =======

Despite all there good there is some bad, not a lot but some
Mainly due to the HUGE new update which is to be expected
Remember this is an EARLY ACCESS game too.

1- there are some instances where you can crash or your game will freeze
2- media players can rarely be bugged and stop working
3- random texture issues which makes them lose resolution
4- not all achievements are currently working or possible

Apart from that there's not too much more issues, maybe slight bugs in games but nothing serious enough to mention.

===== FIN =====
In conclusion, I suggest every single person picks this game up!

the graphics are absolutely beautiful & its seriously a cheap price for the quality and dedication from the developers.

so so so worth the price!
as i said i have around 700± Hours played already and that will keep rising!

Please try this game out and you'll soon see what i mean!
it may not be for everyone but it is certainly perfect for almost everyone!

I know you'll have a blast and welcome to tower unite.",Recommended,280 people found this review helpful 0,1

WARNING: long review, The first part explains what's in the game for those wondering. Skip to the bottom for the pros and cons. Also spoilers of what is in the game, for people who just like to explore blind.

Edit"" I am updating this review since a lot of changes have been made.

Tower Unite is a fun online virtual world that is similar to Playstation Home and Pixeltail's formal game, Gmod Tower. The main features of Tower Unite are the Plaza, the Condos, and the Minigame hub.

The Plaza is the central area of Tower Unite. There are plenty of activities such as trivia, bowling and Laser Tag. It also has stores and a theater. The theater is a place where you can upload videos from youtube or your computer onto the big screen. Then people in the game can gather around and watch those videos. Another main draw of the plaza is the casino. In the casino, you have multiple options to blow your money or make big bucks. There is also fishing, rides, minigame events, etc.

is a place to make your own. You can change it from day to night, customize it with store-bought items or use the workshop to make or use community items. There are several different condo options such as an underwater condo, a highrise, a theater, etc.

are one of the biggest attractions in Tower Unite. There are a few games in the plaza, but the main games can be found from the start menu or the teleport. The game is a variation of the game Infected from the Call of Duty franchise. There is which is a competitive version of Gamecube's Super Monkey Ball. is a vs game between the Knights and a dragon. is a capture the flag-like game with guns. is like a top-down Left 4 Dead game where you team up and kill zombies. Last but not least, is exactly what it sounds like (and incredibly addicting.)

That's the basic of what's in the game. Now here are my personal pros and cons.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Ok, where to begin

I LOVE this game. I love it with my heart. It's one of those games that I can't hate.
I've been playing since the Gmod Tower Lobby 1 days, and every day I boot up this game I ALWAYS have fun. And one of those reason, is the people who play it.
To the new players or the die hard fans, it's people who make Tower Unite. Without them, it would be an empty husk of a resort.

The Good
The game's got love, polish, and a loving dev team who've been stuck to this idea of a social video game hub for over a . Yeah, that long, and they've only got about 10+ people working on it. Considering the amount of polish this games got, thats amazing.

People say this game is dead or dead compared to Gmod Tower, and it really makes me sad when people bring this up in negative reviews, because yeah, it's not got a massive playerbase, but it's quality over quantity. The game isn't dead compared to Gmod Tower.
Fun fact - Gmod Tower's playerbase would range from 100-150, rarely to 150 on busy days. Tower Unite's playerbase ranges from 150+ on most days sometimes even thousands during updates, but often slightly lower during update droughts.

Another thing, update droughts. When there's large gaps between updates, people rush to scream , but the problem is, they most likely don't follow the Trello page [], or aren't in the Discord, which I can't blame them for, and I honestly wish that they were made more apparent to the community, perhaps even making community posts showing update progress.

The gameworlds are fun. Real fun. When people are playing it, which with such a small playerbase isn't too often, as a lot of the traffic is at minigolf, but when it does happen, when you get that rare game, its damn fun.

Microtransactions, specifically how there . In a market saturated with microtransactions and lootboxes, Tower Unite is a breath of fresh air. Fresh spring air. That good shiz.

I don't have a lot bad to say about the game, maybe it's my fanboy tunnel vision holding me back, maybe it's something else, but there's one thing about the game I despise.
The casino.
Anyone who's followed this game a while know just how the casino is. Don't get me wrong, it's well made. It's just bad for the . Personally I think it should be removed from the game entirely, especially when the release of Lobby 3 comes out, I have that large a burning hatred for it. It encourages anti-social activities in a game.

Communication is another problem. Don't get me wrong, the devs are very active in the community. Just not the steam community, only the discussions board, their forums [] and the Discord.
In the Discord, many people have got to chat to the devs, and they can all vouch for them being very swell people, myself included, but I feel the dev's need to think of the bigger picture, the 99 percent.

This game's great. Honestly, I've bought about 6 copies for different people, some of which I barely knew, that's how much I love this game and wan't to see it succeed. The game needs work, but what it needs far more is love. Everyones love.
I honestly doubt anyone will actually read this review, but if you do and don't own this game, change that. There's lots to look forward to.
At the time of making this review, Achievements (released), RC Vehicles (released), Lobby 3 (released) and Fishing (released) are going to be added to the game hopefully soon. Check the Trello, check the forums, check the Discord. This game's going places. Soon.

Remember Home for PS3? You probably don't. Few do. It was supposed to be an online HUB world where PS3 players could gather and socialize in ""cyberspace"", play mini-games such as pool, bowling, etc., own and furnish homes that people could visit - and ultimately launch PS3 games from and perhaps create squads/clans/etc. with which they can all jump into a game of Killzone or CoD or whatever from Home. It ultimate failed because Sony didn't really care much for executing the concepts.

Tower Unite was originally a Gmod module, which emulates much of what Home wanted to be - except you cannot launch Steam games or anything. You participate in a glorified chatroomp-world, where you can attend cinemas (where players que up YouTube videos of memes), play laser tag or bowling or other stuff, and que up for more meaty games such as balloon race (obstacle course of sorts), games of tag, mini-golf, etc.

With various activities, you can earn gold to buy new clothes or, more importantly, furniture for your homes.
This is all well and good and forms the frame work for some really cool stuff.

However, despite me rating the game positively, it's kind of a lackluster experience in the end. Much of it has to do with the community. You can furnish your house but there's not much incentive for people to visit, you really do need to make friends, which is hard because there's not much purpose for people to be hanging out in Tower Unite. The games also tend to be deserted, with mini-golf being the most frequented mode and everything else kind of starved for players.

Still, do yourself a favor and if you buy this game, go check out the homes some people build for themselves. It's absolutely insane how much time some dudes have got on their hands.

Overall: Worth buying to check out a cool idea but lacks a sense of purpose and robust player interest.",Recommended,39,3

Basically Tabletop Simulator for entertainment that isn't a board game. Not an exaggeration.

Watch movies in a movie theater with friends. Play trivia. Go bowling. Golf? We got golf. Laser tag? Zombie Tag? Monkey ball? Yup. Fishing? Roller Coasters? RC cars and Toy planes? Absolutely.

The game literally has a Casino, Arcade, Waterpark, Ferris Wheel, Carnival Area... hell its even got a rooftop Bar and Lounge. Complete with stripper poles.

It's incredibly difficult for me to condense my experience with this game into a few paragraphs. I'll do my best.

According to this game's community, I am over 1000 years old. Someone in the plaza once had the bright idea to pretend it was my birthday, and it has NOT stopped since then. I have been wished a happy birthday so many times that the words ""happy"" and ""birthday"" no longer register in my brain as real English words. I am subjected to an endless aggressive stream of confetti guns and giant cakes. When I close my eyes, I see the sickening afterglow of cake candles and hear the faint discordant echoes of a swarm of low-polygon chef dogs singing a poorly synced rendition of Happy Birthday.

And I bloody love it.

You can play many parts of Tower Unite solo if that's your thing, but above all else this is a social game. There's one thing I can guarantee: if you're looking for friends, you will find it absolutely impossible to play this game without finding friends. Seriously - jump into a plaza, play a few rounds of minigolf or hop around the public condos and your Steam friends list will explode.

I've met the best, most bonkers, ridiculous, brilliant people playing this game, and I'll always be grateful for that.",Recommended,55,22

A seriously fantastic casual multiplayer game that me and my friends have been playing on and off for years, every time we come back to the game the devs have made great progress adding new content and features.

Tower Unite has something for everyone, Arcade games, comprehensive house building and sandbox features, poker and gambling, slot machines, kart racing, cinema, nightclubs and mini golf that's good enough to be its own game. You get the picture, if you don't know what to play you can always find something to do here.

Had great times dancing to tunes in the nightclub with my friends as various player avatars(custom avatars is another great feature). Just what gaming should be, you log on and have a good time doing what you want when you want, with no battlepass, flavour of the month pressure or massive commitments. If you don't play for a while, when you get back their will be new content and things to keep you busy. Well done to the devs for setting a great example of how to do early access on steam!",Recommended,31 people found this review helpful 3,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'll be honest. I never heard of Gmod tower before I bought this game, nor was I interested in the game itself, but I wanted a new mini-golf game and Steam recommended this game.

So I bit the bullet and bought it, $15 USD sounded fair for a mini golf game, but I got much, much more for my moneys worth.

The easiest way to explain this game is to mention Virtual world games like the Playstation Home game/app (Which this game is more akin to) and Second Life (Which Tower Unite is not trying to be, but it has some similarities with).

The most basic point of the game is to enter a server (There is a good number of official servers running 24/7 and some 3rd party ones) and find something to do in the ""Lobby"" (Lobby here means the whole server world), this can be as mundane as going to the casino and mindlessly playing gambling games which may or may not reap big income rewards, going to the theater and watch and/or share videos from YouTube with other people that are in the theater, go to mini games that are around the lobby like Trivia, Bowling or Laser Tag, or you can go for one of the more fleshed out games like Mini Golf, Ball Race (A Super Monkey Ball inspired multiplayer game), Virus (My favorite of the bunch, inspired by the Halo Zombies user game) and a couple of others (With 4 more games planned for future updates).

While playing these games, you get in game money called units. With these units you can buy stuff in the Lobby, and these items can vary from things you can equip and use like the Jet-pack or the Confetti gun (A must for new players) to cosmetic items for your character, and also furniture and building materials for your condo.

Now, about the whole condo thing, I've never been much into the whole making a room/home type of games, but this one piqued my interest and I've been loving the amount of customization one can do to one's condo. You can make a nice mini theater to watch videos with friends, or put down instruments and jam (MIDI support so you can connect your MIDI keyboard is planned for the future), or make a museum dedicated to your art or them dank memes if you are into showing that.

All in all, this game offers a lot of things to do, buy and explore for the measly price of $15 USD, and from what I've seen, the devs are working non stop to finish this game properly and make it as fun as possible without modern day issues like microtransactions or subscription fees.

TL;DR Buy it for the mini-golf, stay for the socializing and different activities/games.",Recommended,41,1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Having seen some of the negative feedback this game has been getting lately, I felt like i had to make this review.

This game is extremly fun and has a promising future.

This game is very Early Access but yet there's already alot to do:
- Minigolf: A very solid minigolf game consisting of 4maps.
- Ballrace: A ball Racing game that is seriously fun for casuals and speedrunners alike.
- Virus: A Zombie/Infected game mode with 3maps. (First person shooter)
- The Casino: The casino is amazing, you can play 3 type of slots, Video blackjack & poker machines, Double or nothing machines, You can play actual poker with others (casual or High stakes), there's just so much you can do, discover it by yourself.
- Trivia: The Trivia game is a beast of its own and really make you feel like you are part of a game show, it's always fun to play with friends and it make you learn stuff!
You can Requests your own Questions to be posted on the trivia game as its open source.
- Your Condo: You can customize your own condo with all of the currency earned from playing minigames, inside condos alone there is so much to do, you can invite your friends, join others, explore the creativity of others, socialize with people, listen to music, watch youtube with your friends, watch movies, animes & cartoons (supports hmtl5), play musical instruments such as the Drums and Piano, having parties or chilling with friends, it is a very social oriented game!
- : Customize your avatar with hats and accesories. (currently 3 player models, Male, Female and Milk cartons)
- : Piano on its own is a beast to master, using ""VirtualPiano Sheets"" you can learn to play your favorite piano songs. (I learned to play some zelda & classical songs)



The game looks great in the Unreal Engine 4.
There is no micro transactions in this game, Everything is acquirable with in-game currency earned by playing mini games.
The soundtrack to this game is seriously amazing.

The Devs are extremly active and always answers our forums Questions, Feedback or Suggestions.
They keep updated on their work and daily tasks on their Official Trello (roadmap).
They have a Twitch stream talking about what they are working on and Etc every friday.
Sometimes they even join the game and come play with us while giving us insights of what's upcoming next. Yes they are a small team (8people) but they are doing ALOT of work.

- The community is amazing
- Tons of fun with friends
- Theater that you can watch videos with said friends
- You can customize your very own condo
- Wide variety of game modes that you can play (Golf, Virus, Planet Panic, and Ball race so far)
- Devs update the game regularly
- Tons of cool things to come in the future


CONS:

- Not optomized very well.
- Some server issues
- No party system with friends
- A lot of bugs (But still playable)


Do I reccomend this game?
Yes

I've been playing Tower Unite since Patch 0.2 and the game has changed quite a bit since those moments. There's lots of good things that I personally like a lot. but also lots of bad things as well. on the good side of things. There's lots of Interesting content to do which I love Doing Daily. All the Available game worlds are really Interesting to play and keep playing. Though sad side of things are that there's not crazy much people which for sure does saddens me a lot when trying to host games. Also there's a lot of those kinds of people as well that joins your games just to ruin it for you. You may wonder how they ruin your games? Well what they would do is just randomly start Kicking other people/players from the game for no reason. Also this game has a lot of Toxicity as well which for sure is a big down side as well. So what I would personally say about this game is that I'm between good and bad with this game.",Recommended,51,0

I have nominated this game for the ""Game Within A Game"" Steam award.

Welcome to Tower Unite, the new integration of Tower, a concept that started in Garry's Mod with a gamemode called Gmod Tower. This concept is the idea of a game where people can socialize, make new friends, and play games to have generally good time. This game does exactly that, and almost every time you jump on, you'll see a new face.

At the moment, this game is no where near finished, and has a lot that can be added to it. However, with only so many people on the dev team, progress is being made quite quickly. Theres often new content to look forward to every month or so.

Still, even if lacking some of the content there is plenty of things you can do with your friends at the moment. If you have the $15 and this looks like something you'd be interested in, definetly give it a shot. There is so much potential that this game holds, and I am more than positive it's going to be filled in. The support would really help the developers.

P.S. I have been playing Gmod Tower since 2013, if that provides any credibility to you.",Recommended,52,0

Casino changed everything.
We now get to suffer in unison to the compulsive addiction of gambling, just so that after hours of vigorous spacebar mashing we can splurge our winnings on a wheel that issues potatoes, hula dolls and the irritatingly undesirable cactus.

But really now, Tower Unite is now ultra fun to play since the community has been pulled together, and we'll be pulled together more and more as the Plaza gains more content.

---1 Year later---
About 50 jackpots and 1600 hours in, still good, it got better, see you next year.

---2 Years Later---
Workshop changed the game immensely, I love this game and I will not stop playing. Developers are the coolest and continue to add huge additions to the game. Hugely recommended.

---3 Years Later---
Lobby 3 came out, Exp and milestone systems and you can fish now, love the game to bits.

---4 years later---
Still playing, still amazing, and it has now gained the Arcade which blew my mind, and recently Accelerate Alpha. Tower Unite is amazing with so many things to do and keeps getting better. I can't wait for the new Accelerate tracks, and more milestones to collect. Since playing from Day 1 this game has changed so much, it may still be Early access but it's nothing to worry about, Tower Unite has more to do than I believe every other similar social gamemode type games out there.
The developers are still working hard and always updating us with what they're up to, this is why I'm a patron and they deserve every penny they get from us, here's to another year playing this wonderful game.",Recommended,63,4

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Got this today via Humble Bundle, so there seems to be a lot of people in there who, like me, have no idea what they are doing (although, for some of them, this does not stop them from doing it anyway, or trying to.)

People seem reasonably friendly. Not the friendliest community I've ever gone into (believe it or not, Rocket League, unranked, in the early days, was) but no one that's really rude or abusive this far, either. A few super nice people, and a lot that can just be ignored.

Game looks GREAT on my 5.5 year old computer, but, the graphics card in this computer is an NVIDIA GTX 760 with *8 gigabytes* of ram on the GPU. (That's how you make a computer last for a long time--Assassin's Creed Odyssey looks great on it too.) But yeah... most people have newer computers with better innards, so I imagine it'll look great for most people.

The UI on this game could use some serious work! Yes, I realize it's early access, so there's something to work on; it's not a complaint, just a comment. I had to laugh though when I was trying to leave my condo (easier said than done,) and got asked if I wanted to ""cancel"" my ""join"" request, and the options were ""accept"" and ""cancel. So am I cancelling my cancellation, or accepting my cancellation, or .... I had to laugh. Just a minor thing, though.

Having a little trouble with getting comfortable getting my xbone controller working better with it, but I think that's PEBKAC more than anything else. So, I exited the game, did a little reading, said ""Ahhh,"" and ""Oh, duh,"" a couple of times, and feel a little better now.

Basically, what you're doing here is playing games with other people--such as minigolf--to earn ""units"" to buy things to furnish your home with. And of course, socializing with other people. In the end, that is what will make or break Tower Unite, I believe: If the community stays friendly, it will be a good community. The problem is that the larger the community gets, the less friendly it's likely to be. They'll need to pay special attention to adding minigames that are more geared toward adults, older teenagers, and more intelligent kids... Or maybe put the stuff for griefers and such into a completely different area of the game.

Let's see, what else. LOTS of loading screens, and I honestly almost fell asleep waiting for one of them, but again, there's a huge influx today from the Humble Bundle people, so that could be why; lots more traffic than they are accustomed to.

No microtransactions and no subscription fee means that to keep this going, they have to continue to sell new copies of it. I had honestly never heard of this game until it showed up in today's bundle, so that's not good. I hope it will work though; seems like they could add almost anything to this to draw more people in, such as more stuff like the trivia, and probably even a smallish battle royale mode, perhaps, if they dream big enough, a fun little RPG--just to get away from so much arcadey stuff. Then again... is there a pinball machine in there anywhere?

Oh well. I'm nearly ready to give it another shot; see if I can get my controller working without making TOO many people angry. :)

If you're looking for a community type ""game,"" this one is looking good if they can manage to keep it going.",Recommended,39,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Game has been in ""Early Access"" for about 6 years now. For those unaware this game was meant to be the spiritual successor to GMOD Tower, a very popular game mode from Garry's Mod years ago. They moved away from GMOD and made this game here. When it released it was extraordinarily popular. The game exploded and was vibrant with the community with a massive amount of players every time you'd log in, sometimes every damn Plaza would be full it was so bustling. However i'm sad to say that the curse of Early Access has taken hold, and the game is not even what could be considered a 'shell' of the older times. I've played Tower Unite on and off, i believe that last time i put some meaty hours in was in the Fishing update and the Christmas after said update. The remaining 'playerbase'--if you could call it that, is pretty toxic, and very drama filled. Cliques of people run Plazas and you can easily get falsebanned for very stupid things. The Devs are questionable in their actions and the amount of falsely banned people is astonishing, considering the original troublemakers are always still at large. Alongside a dwindling playerbase, updates are slow, and very cherry picked. Specific game modes will be updated over others, even if they aren't popular. Virus comes to mind often with this, although Tiny Crusaders also sucks up update time. These are reasonable as...""Early Access"" alongside all game modes needing new content. But there is also a lot of strange choices. A very infamous choice was how long it took for the Arcade to release, many years passed (maybe around 3?) where it was never added despite constant desire from the community. It eventually DID get added but...only half of it. They completed half of the Arcade and left it like that for a considerable amount of time.

I love the game, i love the minigames and i miss the old Gmod Tower-esque community. It was really promising. The foray into Early Access for almost 7 years now has really taken its toll. Perhaps when the EA ends and the game fully releases, it'll bring back folks and drive out the rampant drama cess-pool that is the current 300-750 players remaining on this game. I have my expectations low, but am still optimistic about the future. Until then, i'm keeping this review negative.",Not Recommended,131,20

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Tower Unite, as many know, is the spiritual successor to the popular Gmod Tower. Now, I personally have never played Gmod Tower, so I went into this game without any real prior knowledge about what the previous game was like. The game is still in Early Access, and from what I can tell there's still a LOT of content that the developers are wanting to add to the game. But let's go over what the game has right now...

The biggest a most-fun part of the game is definitely the Mini-Golf. With several unique courses in multiple different settings, the Mini-Golf definitely had the most thought put into it. It's easy to get into and learn the controls, and when I got the hang of it I feel that this is the most fun Mini-Golf I can find on Steam. Even playing alone you can enjoy yourself simply by getting used to the different holes in a particular course and try to beat your best score. People can drop in and out of any game no matter how far along it is if they so wish, and balls can be customized with hats that you can buy for your in-game avatar with the in-game currency.

The big point to the game, I suppose, is to play games to collect in-game currency to purchase furnishings for your condo, where you can invite friends over to to hang out. As far as I can see, there isn't REALLY a lot to do around the condos with other people other than to show off your stuff and watch videos, though. Maybe that'll change in the future.

Other activities include a few other mini-games (such as a shooter game or a Monkey Ball-type game) and some different, smaller activities in the main lobbies such as a casino, some game-show trivia and a bowling alley, with stuff ike bumper cars, an arcade and laser tag being planned for in the future (judging by the so-far under-construction buildings in the lobbies). Once everything gets finished and put out, there will be no shortage of things to do.

Now comes the biggest drawback to the game. The game can lag quite a bit in the lobbies. I run the game on Windows 10, and on a computer that I largely purchased to play games, and the game can still lag for me. I find that the game lags more on high-populated servers, so because of this I don't even bother trying to get onto a server that's more than half full. Hopefully the lag will decrease when the game leaves Early Access, but for now it's a bit of an annoyance on an otherwise very-enjoyable game.

Do I recommend it? Absolutely. I have a lot of fun with the game and I look forward to seeing where it goes in the future. The lag is a bit of a problem at times and something I hope they're able to fix in the future, but otherwise I think this is a solid game with a lot of content, and more to come along the way.",Recommended,23 people found this review helpful 0,0

As of May 2018, this game is still in Early Access. But new content is still being added frequently, despite it being a small team that works on it. There are a lot of things to do in this game at first, which range from various minigames to building a condo. I think the idea of the game is amazing, but it can definitely lack in replayability if you don't have people to play with, which is a shame, considering the game isn't popular (yet?). What I really like about the game, is that minigames are really rewarding. You can get in-game money from them so you can buy pretty cool things for your condo. And another great thing: No Microtransactions!

While I said there are a lot of things to do in this game, most things could get a bit repetitive after a while. This can definitely be fixed with things like Steam Achievements, adding more big things like Arcade, Steam Workshop, and Fishing (Edit: these have all now been added), and also advertising the game more so more people will play it and the lobby becomes more alive.

So, should you buy this game? Yes, I think you should. Not only will you help the developers, but there are still a lot of things to do in the current state of the game to keep you busy for multiple hours, especially if you have friends to play it with. The game has a lot of potential, which is good for an Early Access game. You can keep up-to-date with their updates and progress here:",Recommended,26,2

Lots of this game is super fun! The arcade and zombie games are great, and the achievements/milestone progression tie all the mechanics into the condo decoration. No mtx, cozy and sweet design philosophy. Even though some minigames are a bit disappointing, there's more than enough variety and fun to be had.

But the player population has some really awful elements (like really awful), and there's no way to counter act this as a player. Yes, its not every player, not even a majority. But its enough. The report system is very opaque with little effectiveness and 0 response. Blocking people doesn't block them it just makes parts of their player model invisible. Anyone can still follow you into game lobbies, your private condo, theatres, etc. The number of ways trolls can force someone to see their h*ntai or g*re shock models is too high. The number of ways trolls can force their way around the mute system is too high. The number of ways a pair of trolls can screw a whole lobby out of the game by abusing voting systems is too high. The number of times I've seen someone mic spam slurs and genocidal threats in the middle of plaza, get muted for only an hour, and then come right back and do it again is too high. Not to even mention the p*rn condo owners inviting kids for watch parties... The p*dos don't even get punished.

This game is very fun as a solo player or small group, but until there's some actual action by the devs to either a) reign in the toxic players or b) provide some way for players to actually block people... I can not recommend this game. The public social elements are just exhausting.",Not Recommended,171,0

This review is sectioned off into segments for returning GMod Tower players and newbies who couldn't tell a Hatsune Miku from a good admin.

For GMod Tower veterans who aren't sure if they should make the jump
As someone who has played over 100 hours of GMod Tower on and off, I can say that Tower Unite, at least in the last week that I have been playing it, easily surpasses the Source ""powered"" mod. Despite the change to the Unreal Engine, much of the ""feel"" of the old Tower is present, from not just aesthetic and sound, but also movement, interaction with the world, and minigames - and also some familiar issues, such as load times and crashes. For better or worse, it's surprising how much of that Source feeling they were able to get out of Unreal. It certainly helps that, to my knowledge, the key players of the GMod Tower team are working on Tower Unite.

If you're looking for a point to jump in, now's a pretty decent time, considering that Tower Unite at this point slightly edges over GMod Tower in terms of content and polish, with much more to come over the next few years. Considering 15 bucks was the minimum VIP donation amount back in the day (and you bet I paid it), and also considering that past players and donators also get some neat bonuses, it's a pretty reasonable deal in my humble opinion.

Tower Unite is a spiritual(?) successor to GMod Tower, a GMod gamemode in which, to put in as simple terms as possible, players are able to chill out with friends, watch videos, deck out their own condo, and play minigames. A really casual comparison amongst my friends is Second Life, but with less clunky building tools, decade old menu design, and lonely S&M-loving geriatrics. I'm sure there's some online-chatroom-avatar garbage that's more in line, but I wasn't dragged into those by my degenerate friends so I can't really compare them. Where was I? Oh yeah, GMod Tower was all about having fun with friends and relaxing.

Then something brilliant happened. The guys behind GMod Tower (who now go by Pixeltail Games) realized that GMod, and extension Source, were buggy, clunky pieces of ♥♥♥♥ who's updates often broke literally everything and, to make matters worse, weren't the best to develop for what they wanted to produce. Seriously, GMod Tower sometimes felt like it was held together by nothing but copper-wire and the hopes and dreams of disgruntled server owners. So what were these bright-eyed idealists to do? Shut GMod Tower down of course,

But not without reason - they saw big potential in making a standalone version of the Tower, one on the more supported, recent Unreal Engine, and that could support massive updates and new content. Enter Tower Unite, a brand-new, copyright-free, paid replacement for the now-dead GMod Tower.

In the past year Tower Unite has very quickly begun to eclipse its predecessor in terms of content and scale, and still promises much more to come in the next few years. Seeing how dedicated Pixeltail is to achieving something they've been working on for nearly 7 years, I wouldn't worry about them abandoning it anytime soon. With a growing community and tons of stuff to do, Tower Unite is the very definition of a go-to-game.",Recommended,49,9

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
If you don't feel like reading all of my thoughts on GMT, TU, and PixelTail Games (PTG), then just know that this game isn't worth buying, and you should just play something like VRChat.

Let's start with GMT, Lobby 1.

GMT had a great design of an always active social gamemode that relied on a healthy community. To earn GMC, you had to interact with people to get games going, which you could then use to buy furniture for your suite, which allowed others to interact with you in your own little apartment.

Lobby 1, was perfect. Completely, 100% perfect. It might not have been the prettiest, but it perfectly complimented the formula by having you in an enclosed (besides lakeside and the pool) tower that didn't have much room to stray away from people. As soon as you stepped into the lobby and turned left, everything you wanted would be just a simple walk straight ahead, or turn right or left. And no matter which way you looked, you were bound to see at least one person. It being small might not be something that everyone liked, but it made it so even with the server at half capacity (64 players in OG GMT) you would see people everywhere no matter what was going on. It also had seasonal lobbies just to get everyone hyped up for when the christmas and halloween seasons were arriving.

Then, Lobby 2 was announced, and people were excited. A fresh, big new lobby that was so pretty!

But the problem is, Lobby 2 was when GMod Tower was starting to die. A new lobby wasn't needed at all. Yeah, it is gorgeous for a GMod map, and it is really big, but both those things combined only caused problems for both the gameplay design, and the developers themselves. It caused it to still, to this day, never get finished. You might say, ""PTG said it was because Lobby 2 was at Source Engine's limits. Nothing else could be added into it.""

Edit: Source Engine limits for GMod were only raised recently, but I still know that more things could have been added to GMT Lobby 1. Maybe nothing as much as GMT: Deluxe, but GMT not being able to handle anything more was greatly exaggerated. And even if Lobby 2 was at it's limits then, more could be done for gamemodes. It was only the Lobby that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

That's not true as of late at least, GMT: Deluxe, a fan rehost which got shut down after 3 days via DMCA by Mac, was Lobby 2 but finished, with even more things added to GMT. The simple answer is that the PTG devs couldn't keep developing without getting any money, which is understandable. But then they said they'd also just shut down GMT. They could have passed down the torch to someone else, or just left it running with no developers like they're doing for GMT: Reunion right now. (Except that's worse than anything we've had before.) But they didn't.

And as I've said before, Lobby 2 in itself was directly messing with the formula that GMT was surviving on. It being big and having plenty of open empty areas with nothing to do there just messed with things even more.

Then TU came out. And there is nothing left of the design that made GMT great anymore.

Everything can be accessed by menu's without interacting with anyone. Literally every single thing in this game, besides laser tag and minigames in the lobby, can be done without interacting with anyone. While this is a great feature for a normal videogame, this is a horrible feature for a game that tries to market itself as a social game, with an already dying community.

Don't even get me started either on how easy it is to get everything you want in this game. Because you don't need to interact with anyone to get money, you can pretty much grind Ball Race for 20 hours to get a million units, buy everything you want, and then not play again. Everything is horribly cheap compared to how easily you can get money, and it doesn't help that half the server population of lobbies will be in the casino at all times, not talking to anyone and just racking up units.

Now, before you read this next part, remember that I'm not saying this just because I got DMCA'ed by Mac. Rehosting GMT was just a part of my life that i'm not in anymore. I backed this game back in 2016, with hope and love for PTG, and i've changed my mind since then.

PTG, killed GMT. PTG, doomed TU to fail. PTG, has made every single possible bad decision they could make. I don't know what's going on in their heads, what they're doing in the dev voice rooms, but I know that GMT is dead, and TU will never be good, or as good as GMT once was, and is doomed to fail. I've seen people call this a successor to GMT, but this is nothing of what made GMT great.

I have more I could say, but I don't feel like it's relevant to the game, so i'm not going to put it here. In conclusion, and to shorten this entire essay of a review, this game sucks ass.",Not Recommended,60 people found this review helpful 2,11

Let's get one thing straight...
This game is still early access.

So, this has to be one of the best games i've ever played, there is so much to do.
90% of the people i have met on this game are extremely nice.
Also 90% of peoples condos are full of hentai/porn so beware what you're getting yourself into.

Pro's
-No Lag
-Easy to build things because of the - Stasher - Quick Scaler - Copycat.
-Alot of fun like - playing piano/drums - putting youtube on tv's - building things and decorating your condo.
-Alot of items/furni in the store which are cheap
-Casino - So when you run out of money you can make easy cash - though it will take awhile
-Minigames - Same as ^ if you run out of money go play some minigames! easy win?!

Con's
-Takes forever to load into plaza
-Some minigames are laggy - bowling -
-Slot machines are quite hard to win and you could be there for hours and still get no jackpot! though Grand Quest is the only one that is easy to win - just slay the dragon? Sure.

If you want a fun/productive game, i recommend this.
It's great for a group of friends and also great for making them!",Recommended,53,2
4497,87,Tower Unite,"Posted: May 6, 2020
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Tower Unite is a social sandbox with a plethora of minigames and character customisation, and is a spiritual successor to a former Garry's Mod server that at its time was both extremely popular and also incredibly laggy. It is a role model that games such as Second Life, VR Chat, Rec Room and PS4 Home aspire to be, but often fail to do so.

When you buy Tower Unite, you are not just buying a single game. You are instead buying more games than you can count on both hands, all included as a single package, and with no DLC. Be warned that this one of those games where once you get in to it, it can become both extremely addictive and possible to sink absolutely 10s or 100s of hours in to it.

Gameplay is divided in to four major areas:-

• The Plaza

The Plaza functions very much like a virtual beach resort, which is the central hub for meeting and greeting, and also possesses a multitude of areas and activities such as fairground rides, beach fronts, treasure hunts, a broadwalk with sideshows, an almost fully-featured coin-op arcade, 10-pin bowling, laser tag, a casino (always better to have a virtual gambling addiction, much opposed to having a real life one), a video-sharing movie theatre, a waterpark, fishing areas, a series of shops where one may customise their experience, secret areas, temporary NPCs that give away free items, and a small arena that frequently hosts time-limited multiplayer activities where you compete against others for high scores. More features slated to be in the works consist of a nightclub, an expanded arcade and fully fleshed out arcade, bumper cars, an on-rails amusement park dark ride, and underwater exploration.

• Condos

Each player has access to a personal residence (condo) that they can customise to their hearts content with a wide array of furnishings, electrical appliances (such as TVs that can playback YouTube videos), gadgets, games, picture frames that can display images from the internet, milestone trophies, in-game collectibles, and user-generated workshop content. Players may visit condos belonging to others (however, be very wary of potentially long load times and/or adult content). You may also choose to allow others to visit your condo. Other players may only visit your condo while you are active within it and only if you grant them the access.

• Minigames

Players may host or join a variety of minigames such as Virus, Minigolf, Ball Race, and Accelerate to name but a few.

Ball Race is a Super Monkey Ball clone where you zorb race against both the clock and others players through a series of progressively difficult obstacle courses where you must carefully manage your balance and momentum while collecting melons and avoiding precariously placed obstacles and bottomless pits.

Minigolf haves you simultaneously tee-off against other players in putting a golf ball through a full 18-hole miniature golf course, where you must putt the ball in to each hole in the fewest possible number of strokes. Each hole progresses in difficulty and features a wide variety of silly obstacles where you must very carefully plan and time your putt as the physics are solid.

Virus is a last man standing type of minigame that attempts to replicate the game mode of the same name that featured heavily in the 2000s British time-travelling, sci-fi comedy cult classic couch co-op FPS franchise TimeSplitters (the spiritual successor to GoldenEye 64), where survivors armed with an array of anachronistic weapons must face off and last as long as possible against patient zero and other infectees. Each round starts with one player being randomly chosen as patient zero who must then attempt to infect other players by using their cunning and catching survivors off guard. The round ends when all players are infected or when the time runs out.

As of June 2020, Accelerate is an arcade kart-racer in the vein of Mario Kart, and is the latest edition to Tower Unite's repertoire of non-plaza minigames. Race against others around cartoonish environments. Drift around bends at speed. Collect and deploy power-ups themed around other minigames in the TUverse to either protect your position in the race or hinder others. However, with Accelerate currently in alpha phase, bugs are to be expected.

• Customisation

Players can customise their character and condo with a wide array of items but not without cost. The majority of items require in-game currency earned from participating in mini games, gambling in the casino, among other activities such as completing achievements and reaching progression milestones. Some items are unlocked only through mini game progression, hanging out in the plaza, hanging out in condos, or through significant grinding in the arcade. There are no requirements to spend actual physical real currency for micro transactions, and custom player models from the workshop are cost free.",Recommended,29 people found this review helpful 6,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
First of all, calm down, it's Early Access.
Don't expect it to be exactly like Gmod tower because it's not. Not only because they can't use copyrighted assets, but because they're adding cool new content.
So the developers are still the same, they didn't sellout or anything like that.
It's the same Towers, but not on Gmod. This is how a good game does it by itself, but they need time, money and support.

The good stuff!
+ All old minigames are back (Virus, Ballrace and Minigolf, so far).
+ New minigames out and coming soon.
+ New items, new currency.
+ Very nice graphics. (though read the not-so-good section as well)
+ Developers are always there to answer any question.

The not-so-good stuff...
- If you have a low-mid end PC, you won't be able to run it very well, specially when you're in a server with many people.
- Virus doesn't feel the same (it feels much more fast paced, but maybe that's just me).
- Character customization is very limited. I hope this changes in the future, because all people have the same body types atm.
- Servers. This is what I don't like at all. 2 reasons:
1. People won't be joining your condo because it's going to be another server, and that's just a waste of time.
2. Too many servers that aren't official, even though they're dedicated. (so you'll see random people's dedicated servers filling up the list).
- If you play a minigame in any server, if the host leaves, the minigame is over.
- It doesn't feel like a community anymore, people just straight join into a minigame, or their condo. I don't know if there's any reason to join the plaza anymore. I miss the waiting queue for the minigames, but maybe this is more practical (I really wish everything would be in the same server though).
- Some annoying bugs to fix, but you know, it's Early access.

If this game never grew and stayed the same as it is now, I'd actually rate this bad, but since the developers are so hard-working and dedicated, I have no problem giving this a good review, because I know it will get better.
I was in the Private Alpha and content came out frequently and this doesn't seem to change. So give it a try, even if you don't play it now, you'll play it later for sure.

UPDATE:
Due to the hard work from the develpers adding new content from time to time, I'd recommend it to anyone, because it's getting really fun. I only wish there was more people around. Come play! :)",Recommended,67,4

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
After reading many of the other reviews for TU, I found that, from the context of a new player looking to purchase the game, they probably weren't too helpful. I'll offer some insight into the game, largely based on my personal experiences and what I've learned at large. The goal of this review is to be a small primer that tells someone interested in the game what to expect and what not to expect.

What to Expect

TU is a very casual-friendly game, easy to pick up, with plenty to do and things to keep you occupied. This is the type of game I fire up when I just want to wind down after a long day, socialize with some friends and not have to worry about too much. This is not a hardcore game. You play at your pace and set your own goals, whether that be having the most amazing condo set-up ever, or earning all of the badges from the various minigames in the game. Being a social game, your experience will, in large part, be determined by your interactions with other players. One recommendation I have to anyone new starting the game is to have a friend of yours also start with you, and to start playing with that person. It's very difficult to get into this game if you have no one to play with at the start, and I can imagine this has been the reason certain people don't get very much into it. While it's possible to go it alone and meet people that way I think you'll have much more luck with taking a buddy with you from the beginning. Another thing I have to mention is the community. I've met some really cool people here that enjoy this game. However, there are a lot of bad apples in the form of trolls, furries and people just generally looking to ruin your experience (often these people will check all three of these boxes). These people can be avoided easily enough, and you can continue on your merry way to find sort of people that will enjoy hanging out.












Keep in mind that everything I've described has been through my personal experience playing the game. Yours will be your own different, personal journey. Between the condos, minigames, social aspects, and continued development, TU has a lot going for it. To anyone new or who is on the fence about purchasing this game: you can help create the type of experience you want on the game. When it comes to social interaction within the game, avoid the type of players you need to avoid and gravitate towards the ones you get on with. Do the same thing with minigames, playing what you like, while avoiding the games or activities you don't enjoy. Maybe you're not interested in the condo/decorating aspect? You can ignore it entirely if you so choose, and can simply enjoy the minigames. I hope this review was in some way helpful to you. If you decide to get the game, I hope you enjoy it as much as possible! Final note: Me and a friend on TU often throw parties at his condo in the game. New players or other cool people are always welcome to join in the fun. We'd be happy to help you get to know the game if you have any questions.",Recommended,39,2

there's no reason for it to be the way it is after 8 years

suffers massively from scope creep aswell, devs keep adding undercooked game modes nobody in this wants done first

also imagine GMOD level netcode, but on purpose, and worse. and the games play like jittery unsynced garbage

creating your own base is the glitchiest. place object get stuck in menu have to kill yourself and teleport back. building with friends and moving an object group dissaembles them into a thousand shards. moving objects resizing them for no reason. aswell as the devs changing things with the textures causing everything to assign every so often

the house system is cool but currently the 7 condos up are anime women getting railed and what i think is an actual pedophile condo. and the other 6 are all my friends on friends only that are actually enjoyable.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL;DR: The game is good, but the devs may mark you as a cheater if you're too good. That and you/your friends may get bored quickly.

I really wanted to recommend this game, I can't do that because there are fundamental issues with the game and some interesting choices made by developers.

I will say though that the game is good. There are a lot of fun things to do in this game. So if I were you I would look at gameplay of the available game worlds and maybe look at some of the workshop condos available to get an idea of what you can do before you decide whether or not to get this game.

Over the year I've played I have recommended the game many times and have even bought my friends copies of the game. However all of these people no longer play the game. The game has an issue with keeping an audience. With the plaza, the condos, and the game worlds it takes very little time to ""see it all"" and be done. That's why when there are major updates there will be a huge increase in players and then it drops off again.
There's nothing to really keep people playing. Yes there are cosmetic items you can unlock, and the games are fun, but there's no real sense of progression other than getting better at the game itself.
You earn units to upgrade your condo and buy cosmetics for your character, but there is something missing in this game to keep people coming back. Whether it's the lack of people being social in the game, or some game worlds being so empty that you can't find/start a game, or even if you're not into building a condo, I think the reason differs person to person.

My major reason for now not recommending the game is because the recent action taken against the Ball Race leaderboards.
As you can see by my hours I have played this game a lot, and many of those hours were playing Ball Race.
For those people who don't know there was a launch glitch known as 'buffering' that allowed players to get an impossible/unfair time to people who didn't know about the glitch. Recently this glitch was banned (or at least so I've heard) and as a result a lot of top level Ball Race players were banned/marked for suspected cheating. Upon providing video evidence a lot of these players were unbanned. To me I feel like I constantly need to be recording my runs in case I get a time that is really good. That's not how I want to play. I want to play the game without having to feel like I need to look over my shoulder and make sure I have evidence to prove my innocence.


If you really want this game and it seems cool, go for it, but be aware that you may have a hard time keeping your friends interested or maybe even keeping yourself interested. And be wary about the possibility of getting too good or you may be marked a cheater.",Not Recommended,123,18

It all started when watching Jameskii's video ""Not VRChat"" where he played Tower Unite.

The game instantly caught my attention when he was on the Whirl-a-Fish arcade machine (the Monster Drop arcade machine in Tower Unite).

After the video, I instantly purchased the game and fell in love with it. I even encouraged two of my friends and my boyfriend to get the game aswell, and they also don't regret purchasing it. We always have such a fun time together ^~^
Even a new friendship grew thanks to the game ❤️

I played it over 50 hours in under a week (I had vacation) and I don't think it will just stay by that.


So, in conclusion:

The pros:
- It is extremely fun to play
- For the price it is offered at you seriously get a lot of content (Casino, Arcade, multiple minigames, Bowling and much more)
- The huge variety of custom avatars you can choose from (Workshop avatars :D)
- The amazing customization options for your condos (your residences)
- The extremely amazing ping (I live in Germany, went onto an US West server and still had a ping between 70-80, which is amazing)
- The aspect that there are absolutely no microtransactions
- The constant updates (the developers do not leave the game behind like other developers did to other games)

The cons:
- As perfect as it is, there are still some parts in the game that are a bit buggy or need a better finishing touch (for example the Billards physics)


The game is definitely completely underrated and way more people should get it. It is a lot of fun and with friends it is even better 😊


I definitely give it a 10/10
No changes on that statement.
Would totally recommend it.",Recommended,22 people found this review helpful 1,4

Honestly people keep comparing this game to VR Chat but this game is so much better than that (without the VR experience). VR Chat can be fun but is mostly full of weirdos trying to flirt with you, trollers, and basically nothing really fun to do other than talk to people if you can manage to keep friends on there. Complete opposite experience on Tower Unite, I have made a few great friends on this game. And I'm so glad to have met people in this community. Everyone is so welcoming and fun to be around. Yes i have ran into 1 or 2 trolls but nothing compared to VR Chat. You can spend your time on this game playing mini games like Ball Race, Mini Golf, Laser Tag, Bowling etc. or you can spend your time at the casino gambling your IGC away lol. Its also fairly easy to make IGC which I really appreciate. I hate with a burning passion when games are P2W. Decorating or building condos are super fun too! You can even add rollercoasters, waterslides, or whatever ride you can imagine if you dedicate learning the building mechanics. Def worth the money IMO but thats just me. I mean would it be cool to see this game hit VR one day? ABSOLUTELY. Do i need it to enjoy the game? Absolutely not. Again, take my advice or dont everyone has their own opinion but at the end of the day this game has some great developers and are constantly making great changes and adding new things or events.",Recommended,26,0

Here's a list of what you're buying:
No micro transactions
Minigolf
Ballrace (basically super monkey ball, real fun physics)
Little Crusaders (basically Ultimate Chimera hunt, everyone tries to press the button on the dragon's back while it kills them)
Virus (Infect FPS)
Zombie massacre (top down zombie wave survival shooter)

And plaza minigames which vary in quality:
Bowling
Trivia
Poker (multiplayer and singleplayer variants)
Blackjack (singleplayer)
some kinda boring slot machines that have a net profit and jackpots
Laser tag (usually the more people the more fun, only a single map to play on)
Typing derby (race of who can type the fastest)
Theater (Place to watch stuff with your friends, you can do this in condos too)
Condos (You can customize your own home, all with in game currency you buy from games. You can upload images and workshop models too)
Random minigames in plaza (Can be kinda fun)
Plaza (place to hang out, do a lot of the things i mentioned above, and lots of stores and funny little secrets and easter eggs if you look closely)
Cosmetics, weapons, and toys (Lots of fun stuff to buy. Jetpack that lets you fly. The weapons are only for looks but its fun to hit people with them. Lots of bonus stuff to find around like potions that make you tiny and such)
Any time use any 3D player model from the workshop for your avatar.

This game has a fun unique charm and humor to it. Lot's of jokes hidden around, and on item descriptions.




People complain about not being able to make matches in games that aren't ball race and minigolf, but if you go to the lobby and make some friends, or even just ask chat, you might be surprised how many people want to join you.
For all the bad reviews of this game, I have to say it's still worth the price. The game is still incomplete, but there's lots to do. Most of the bad reviews on here still have many hours, and that's probably because they enjoyed the game. Even if they were disappointed with slow development after they used the game a lot.

Maybe they'll add the new in progress features in the next 10 years, maybe the next two, I don't really know. If you get bored go check it out after an update, or come for the seasonal events.
Point is there's lots to do for the price of 20 dollars, and I think that's worth it and the game is fun.",Recommended,18,0

There's just a bit of everything in Tower Unite and it's worth at least installing and exploring it. It reminds me of Habbo Hotel from way back in the day, just a whole lot better and not predatory.

Are you tired of the virtual worlds you tried already & want something way better than Meta, Second Life & VR Chat? You are in luck, this game allows you to do way more than all three of those games!
It lets you have more people in a single area (64 people) versus VR Chats (40).
1. There are WAY BETTER moderation controls in this game to help you moderate users compared to Second Life & VR Chat. (*People can't crash you! *You can hide avatars, you can voice & text mute, you can block profiles, you can ban & kick. *You can implement your own rules for your home!)
2. You can actually build far better looking worlds and better games than Meta & VR Chat. You don't even need to open up Unity or Unreal Engine, you can build it all from within the game itself!
You can actually use ANY of the custom models that people upload at any time in your home!
Say you visit your friends house and they built using custom furniture, all you have to do is look up those items in the workshop and you can put it in your house to!
3. You can change your avatar to ANY of the available avatars at ANY TIME for FREE in Tower Unite versus in Second Life & VR Chat where you have to actually go looking for them or buy them with real money!
4. The games & music that Tower Unite has by default are actually GOOD & FUN!
5. Although anyone can play any game, there are a lot of very cool/chill/social people who play this game, in my opinion much more so than the competition.
6. You can actually NAME your house so people know what to expect & can find it easier, for instance you could write that you are hosting an event or want to meet new people etc, unlike VR Chat where the instance is the same for everyone and you don't know what to expect.
7. Last but not least for those who are interested in Virtual Reality, this game HAS VR, but it is still being improved on! So there is no reason to wait!",Recommended,22 people found this review helpful 1,0

After 400 hours, I think its time I give this game a proper review. If you've ever wanted a game to play in which you can just relax and hangout with friends, this is a perfect game. The amount of stuff you can do is insane, from spending hours watching random Youtube videos in your condo with friends, to gambling in the casino or relaxing at the arcade, there's never a dull moment.

The minigames are also fantastic, we currently have Ball Race (which is basically Monkey Ball), Virus (Zombies Vs. Humans), Accelerate (Mario Kart), Minigolf (which is as good if not better then Golf with Your Friends), Zombie Massacre (basically Dead Ops Arcade in Black Ops 1), Little Crusaders (1 Dragon vs. Knights), and 3 more minigames on the way.

If you like decorating or building, you can spend hundreds of hours (guilty) customizing your condo to your liking, or you can buy a completely flat map and build your own condo from scratch. Almost every piece of furniture can be customized, so you aren't limited with what you can make. There is also Steam Workshop support, so you can find items you like and place them in your condo.

If you ever get bored of hanging out in your condo you can partake in many different plaza events, such as Treasure Hunting, Snowball fight, Chainsaw Deathmatch, Fruit Frenzy, etc. You can also spend some time at the pier catching fish, or meet up with some friends to play Laser Tag or Bowling.

The only downside is that this game can get laggy sometimes, especially when hosting a huge condo party. If I have more then 10 people in my condo at one time, I will drop from like 50fps to sometimes 10fps. This game really needs to be optimized more, but despite that, It's an incredible game and I've made some extremely good friends on here. I recommend giving this game a shot, especially if you're into games like VRChat.",Recommended,17 people found this review helpful 1,0

Tower Unite... where to begin?

This game is just a huge improvement over GMOD Tower. GMOD Tower had some paid features like dimming the lights and such and had been limited by the engine which was the source engine. GMOD Tower had a lot of fun things to do in it and it did it well which is something that I think the developers of GMOD Tower did very well which was push the Source Engine to it's limit to provide one of the best GMOD experiences that I have ever seen.

Tower Unite just expands on it and makes it 100 times better. The Unreal Engine 4 allows for much more than using Source Engine. Instead of having to wait for the painfully slow GMOD Tower loading screen, this game allows it to be quicker and easier to use which I appreciate them doing. It also allows for more personal creativity of your character which is great and in the end, makes this a huge improvement over GMOD Tower.

Pros:
-Better Engine than GMOD Tower
-Character Customization
-Condo Customization
-Mini Games which You Can Play With Your Friends and Still Earn Money
-Currency System
-New People To Meet
-Watch Videos with Friends in One Room

Cons:
-Sometimes Weird and Glitchy Cosmetic Items
-Placement of Items Can Get Glitchy in the Condo
-Sometimes Odd and Weird Community

This game is still in early access so things are bound to change. Right now, bugs and glitches are the major cons and I am hoping to see them ironed out and fixed as soon as possible but in the end, this is a great game and I would recommend anyone looking to buy it to buy it now because your purchase supports the developer and the developers need as much money as they can to make the game possible and entertaining to play!

Tower Unite is a large online world filled with games and activities to keep you busy for many hours.
The game in fact has so much to offer that I don't even know where to start.

Create your own character or use one of the many available on the Steam Workshop.
Buy a condo and style it to your own liking, invite your friends to watch a movie in your house or in the public cinema.
You can even buy music instruments and give a private concert.

When you enter the plaza you start in a mall, here you can buy furniture, toys, electronics, wearables or other condo's, just to name a few.
But for me the fun started after walking outside, where you see different buildings like the bowling center, arcade, casino, cinema and the fun fair.
The Arcade is filled with all sorts of games, beat your own high-score or that of others and get on the scoreboard, collect tickets and exchange them for all sorts of prizes.
Rather want to play something with friends or randoms? Enter the GAMES building to find mini-games such as midget-golf, racing games, laser gaming and even killing zombie's.

Maybe you want some relaxing time and go fishing!
There are many types of fish and items of different rarities to find in the sea, and you can even keep the fish and put them in your own aquarium at your condo, or sell them to make some money.

As you can see, the list of things to do is endless, and the game is still in early access!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is such a letdown.

On paper Tower Unite sounds incredibly fun; playing games with your friends, earning currency to purchase cosmetics and furniture, decorating your condo, etc. Essentially the social aspect of the game is what makes it fun for me. Constantly playing Mini-Golf or Virus (because these are the only populated games usually) does get boring after a while.

Sadly, this isn't enough to keep the game alive. The 12 developers, supposed ""full time"" (Monday-Friday, 10 AM - 6 PM) work at a soulcrushingly slow rate. The updates they do release are usually barren of content or outright useless (rollercoaster).
They also appear to have their priorities wrong; one example is working on parental controls (which again, is being worked on incredibly slowly) that no one really needs right now. Another example is furniture, but guess what; it's only rocks, trees and plants. Not tables or anything like it. I feel like they have too many projects going on at once which may explain the slow rate of content being produced.

What the game needs is content, even new cosmetics or furniture added regularly would help keep the game alive by giving players something to work towards. Right now I don't see this game moving forward because of the disorganized and inefficient development cycle.

If you visit the SteamCharts page for Tower Unite, you can see that the player population is dwindling despite having around 130k owners (as of October 2017), again indicating a lack of interest in the game due to the lack of content. Player retention is going down the gutter because of this, and it's a real shame.

To the developers, I ask you to spend some time considering what the players want or get rid of the dead weight because there is no way 12 ""full time"" developers can work at such an abysmal rhythm.",Not Recommended,60,6

""dont you dare go hollow""
tough, already did. A series of updates that add nothing to the social aspect or even fix some of the jankiness in this game, safe to say the heart isnt there any more.
Community is questionable, VR support is only added as a bait for people to buy as it doesn't even function properly, and with barely enough players to keep all the minigames alive it can feel empty as all hell. I have fun catching up with those who mingle in TU, its why i come back alongside the condo building but its hard to support it when 7 years almost 8 now, it feels like poop still. constant hitching, frame drops and bugs that never get ironed out either.
My favourite part is if you voice your opinion on said matters, you are the problem apparently, so you get removed and issues dont get fixed. Only for maybe one of the bugs that have existed for 5 years to get fixed and everyone to think its amazing.

Its lackluster right now, feels directionless and in a state of intensive care where its only being kept alive on life support. which is a huge shame, considering it could be the very Social MMO and hub people come to, but its as wide as the ocean and as deep as a puddle - with said puddle being contaminated beyond belief.",Not Recommended,133,0

I played Gmod Tower for almost two years. I was so impressed with what the developers of this game were able to do with the Source Engine and create Gmod Tower. I put in a little over 200 hours into Gmod Tower, and was excited to see that they were planning to make a stand alone version of Gmod Tower, with little to no engine restrictions for what they wanted to create.

When the Kickstarter failed, they instead made a Indigogo with a more reasonable price goal, and they exceded it by $20k. I'm happy to be one of the supporters for the game financially. I am very, VERY happy with how the game is coming along. The graphics are great, with the most recent update (2.0.0) they've reduced the very long loading times to something more reasonable, the currently implemented games are very fun to play, and even more to come in the future.

Not only are there games, but you can use the money you collect from games and activitys to furnish and customize your own condo, you can sit down and watch youtube videos with others. Overall, this is a very casual expirence, and it's amazing. They plan to do so much with this game, and what they have delivered already makes me feel my $200 investment was well worth it. I cannot recommend this game enough, and encourage people to buy it, even in it's early stages. The game is still amazing to play.",Recommended,23,0

Generally good for its price.

Parental supervision required for minors.

Positives

Condos

In my opinion this is the strongest feature of the game, making your own personal space and expressing your creativity.
Creation tools work for the most part and new features being are added such as Condo IO and more steam workshop integrations.
You can find great creations made by players .


A significant part of this game will be sharing YT videos and music through the media players scattered all-around, works well-enough and is a good experience.


Both inside and outside the plaza you can play a great quantity of minigames, they can be a lot of fun.


The developers are still actively making additions to the game , generally meet the roadmap and do provide status updates regularly.





The game suffers from having a very small playerbase which negatively impacts almost every aspect of this game, you will have a hard time filling lobbies for the games and contributes to a generally feeling of emptiness all around. This is greatly exacerbated if you are not a player from the Americas as that is the largest player group time zone.
The developers don't seem to be making much effort to address this issue, keep in mind if you expect it to improve.


Though the game does have a lot of features you will find that not a small amount of them lack polish, you will come across bugs that can harm your experience interacting with them, unfinished parts and some lack of cohesion.
Netcode is not great so playing gamemodes (especially PvP/Adversarial ones) is not that great.

Media Players suffer for not being able to play MP4 encoded videos on YT. (Not all but some videos are affected)


There have been added components to the game that don't seem to really add to the experience relative to the work required to implement and makes developement of the game seem to lack focus.
The greatest example of this is the addition of Libretro, it doesn't appear to have been asked, it servers no real purpose apart of being a gimmick, and is for the most part forgotten and unused.
UGC features are being added very slowly with odd updates in-betwen.

If you plan to stay long-term keep that in mind.



As with any multiplayer game you have to gamble on the kind of players you will come across, overall for Tower Unite is quite positive, you wont find extremely toxic people , and there are veterans that are very friendly and have set-up tons of unofficial events and small communities. Very LGBTQ+ friendly.


When entering player condos keep in mind that there are no restrictions for what can be put on canvas items, if you are streaming disable all canvases. It is very common to find unsafe content.


For 20 bucks you will get more than your money's worth if the game interests you as advertised, you can get an odd 50 hours from minigames and about 200 including socializing and creative building aspects.",Recommended,22,3

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Disclaimer: I backed this game with $30 on IndieGogo.

After 2 years, I am changing my review to negative. And I am almost certain it will stay this way.

The developers don't care what the players want, they keep adding things nobody asked for and ignore 99% of suggestions. Any kind of negative criticism about the game gets deleted, hidden or shot down by the few people that still support the game because they don't want to face the realization that the money they put into the IndieGogo campaign has been wasted.

Several developers have outright left PixelTail Games after years of being with them, only to be replaced by people who used to openly insult and bully other members of the community or people you've never seen before. They are starting to realize that their ship is sinking and are panic-hiring new developers as a result.

After over 2 years they still haven't managed to create proper playermodels. The same placeholders that we had on launch are still in game. Yet they somehow managed to create 6 minigolf maps that no one asked for. And a rollercoaster that is as exciting as it sounds. As of writing this review, the last meaningful content update was over 5 months ago. The last was over 2 months ago.

The community management is even more atrocious than the game development. There are 2000+ members in their Discord and yet it's a literal wasteland because it's not fun to be there, same goes for their forums. Both are barely moderated and don't allow for criticism or suggestions that slightly go against what the developers want. Both have their respective features stripped to the bare minimum. Almost every single person I met in their community isn't a part of it anymore, and the rest are about to leave aswell.

As for the social aspects of the game, they don't exist. There is no reason to socialize with people in this game because you can play a lot of things alone, by yourself. You can make any hosted server private.
Someone brought this issue up in their Discord and received the following response from the most active community member:

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
After playing this game for almost 1000 hours as of writing this review and doing almost everything the game has to offer, I feel like I have a decent understanding of the ins and outs of this game and how the mechanics work. It's been an amazing experience that I would love to share with everyone!

Introduction: I always seem to get back to this game, even after I have a break to play other games. I love being able to socialise, do mini games with my friends and play casually. If you don't have friends to play this game with, the community is very friendly and welcoming compared to the majority of multiplayer games that have a lack of moderation with the report system not doing anything to combat the issue, resulting in toxicity and being disrespectful while hearing all kinds of terrible slurs. From what I seen, this game takes all reports serious and will take action if there's someone that might be trying to mistreat you and make you uncomfortable. This is what other games should try and do to make it a welcoming environment for everyone to keep the player base healthy. Tower Unite is very underrated and definitely deserves more attention!

Anyways, here are the pros and cons of the game from my own experiences and perspective.

Pros:

- There is a lot of things to do at the Plaza with many areas to interact with. There is something for everyone to enjoy. It may be overwhelming for new players, but there's a lot of people that would be more than happy to help you with the basics and get you into the game!

- The amount of items you can obtain in this game is crazy. Even after investing so many hours into the game, I still have items I have not obtained yet. It's perfect for those that love to achievement hunt and complete everything. There are so many collectables and rewards to get. It is also impossible to 100% this game and get all of the achievements since the game is still in early access with achievements that you can not obtain until they get implemented. However, you can complete the majority of the achievements, having over 90% of them being doable. You also get money for completing achievements, so there's no reason not to hunt for achievements if you want something to do and achieve!

- The mini games and events are fun and perfect for earning money and playing with your friends. Some mini games give you more money than others, but it's really worth trying all of the mini games and seeing what you enjoy the most. Mini Golf is probably my most favourite one to do and is the most popular one among the community. It's definitely worth trying!

- If you love decorating and customising, condos are amazing to play around with. You can spend hours to try and make the perfect condo for everyone to enjoy. There's a wide variety of condos to choose from with many ways to adjust your rooms to your liking. It's very relaxing, and you can even let your friends access most of your tools to provide some assistance with your condo and make it more enjoyable and easier to customise.

There are a couple of cons that I found when playing this game, but I'm very sure that the majority of these issues will be fixed in future patches!

Cons:

- The optimisation can be bad. I found the FPS to be very inconsistent, even if you have a really good PC with high end hardware. For example: You can be at 144 fps for one moment and then it dips below 100 fps out of nowhere, regardless of what you do. I found the Arcade is the worst area when it comes to this, having constant FPS drops. This can be a little irritating, but this shouldn't affect your enjoyment if you adjust the in-game settings to make it more consistent.

- Bugs! Some places and mini games are buggy, but they are usually minor. In the worst case scenarios, it is a bit of an inconvenience. As the game gets updated, it should be much better.

Overall: This game is highly recommended with many, many hours of content and ways to entertain yourself. I found a lot of lovely people in this game that I ended up becoming friends with. This game has the friendliest community I've ever seen, making it a very enjoyable experience. There can be some horrible people every now and then, but action is taken if you report them due to its amazing moderation. I really look forward to see what else this game will have in the future as more major updates happen. It may be slow, but it will definitely be worth it. Thank you so much for making this underrated gem, PixelTail Games <3",Recommended,22 people found this review helpful 1,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Very Awesome Game.

Let me start off by saying, don't let the player count put you off. There may be a peak of 400 players per day, however that is plenty for you to have fun and play games with. 99% Of the community is welcoming and Nice to new players and will play minigames with you if you ask in the chat.

- The Plaza:

The plaza is awesome. It may be a little unoptimized at the moment, but it is bearable. In the plaza you have access to everything you need: Minigames, Stores and more. The plaza gives you access to areas such as: The Casino (Where most of the server is quite a lot of the time lol), Lasertag (Fun Team Based FPS minigame), Bowling (You know what that is, c'mon!), Trivia (Great fun, questions get thrown at you and a bunch of other players - awesome!), Typing Rally (Where you have to type as fast as you can to get to the end with your horse) and much much more.

- The Minigames (Virus, Little Crusaders, etc...)

The Minigames are amazing! Each minigame feels like its own unique game. Virus is an FPS game in which you start off as a survivor, 1 person out of all of the survivors is infected and has to infect all remaining survivors. The survivors have to survive for around 2 minutes. It is a really fun mode (One of the best in my opinion). Little Crusaders is a game in which you either play as a Knight or a dragon. 1 player plays as a Dragon, the others as Knights. The Knights have to Push a button on the Dragon's back while the Dragon has to eat all Knights. Simple, but really, really fun and addicting.

There are quite a few other minigames (Ball Race, Minigolf and another which is in a rough state right now (It is being fixed though)) and these are great too, I just don't have hours to write this review.

By playing these Minigames you earn Units, which you can use to Purchase:

- Buyable items

Using units you can buy many things. Units can be earned by playing Minigames, or by gambling at the Casino. With Units you can buy Clothes, Character Effects, Equipable items (Such as confetti guns), Furniture and electronics for your Condo (Your own House/ Apartment basically). There are many things to buy after playing a few mini-games.

- Your Condo

You Can Own A Condo (A Small Apartment or Large House of sorts). These Condo's can vary in size and what they look like, but they are ALL customizable. Most recently they have added an Underwater condo, it looks cool but is pretty expensive (400,000 Units!). You can design many things in your condo, you can decide what the walls, floor and ceiling looks like aswell as many other things. As I said earlier, you can also buy and place furniture. In Your Condo you can watch Youtube with your friends (If you own a TV), mess around and pretty much just have fun.

- Do You Need Friends To Play?

No. The simple answer is No. Friends may make it more enjoyable, but they are not needed. By playing Tower Unite you will 100% make friends. After my First 10 Hours Playing the game, I already had 3 new friends, we play together quite a lot. If you play on your own you will still have fun. The game is great with, or without friends.

- To Wrap Up

Tower Unite is an amazing game and is 100% worth your time, and your money. Even at full price this Early Access game is amazing and will provide you with Hours of Fun even at its current state. More stuff is also being added Constantly, so the fun will never really run out. Get bored? Wait a few months and have tons of new stuff to do!

- Warning

Do not, whatever you do go into the Casino. You will never escape, you will never ever get out. Legend even tells of one lonely soul who was stuck in that hellhole for decades. Beware.

Buy the game. Its Great.",Recommended,13,0

Game is great! Developers are a small but extremely resourceful team that are always striving to pump out great content and are always on top of bugs that may arise.

You're able to build a condo/decorate it how you want, you're able to upload workshop models, play in the casino (GTA casino has NOTHING on this one), play in an amazing arcade, do type racer games, have fun bowling, fishing, honestly... almost anything you ask for Tower Unite has it.

Zombie's,
Lazer Tag,

Best thing is the creators are still adding more content.
The community is not toxic, of course there are always those people who you can simply mute :D

Great game to gather a friend, friends, make friends and/or simply play solo.

Loading time can be a bit grinding at times when going into the plaza area, though that two minute wait isn't really a problem considering the amount of positive things that revolve around Tower Unite.

Full price is worth it,. half price is worth it... Any price really. Even if you only enjoy one or two of the options they have to offer it's worth it.

A game that I wish I had installed and played a long time ago. Though, more then satisfied with the time spent as of this moment and will be looking forward to plenty of hours in the future.

Early Access Game - One that is fulfilling watching it grow.

I really, really, really love this game. It came into my life at a time when I was having a hard time and it's really done wonders for my psyche. I've made some good friends and I always have fun.

It's kind've a mixed bag of a game. If you remember PS Home back in the day, it's very much like that except no microtransactions whatso ever. All game currency is earned by playing games and unlocking achievements. But if you don't remember PS Home... well... Think of it like a giant hub. Steam Workshop integration means you can pick from a wide range of avatars or design one yourself! You have a lobby where you can hang out and there are minigames, a casino, a theater, stuff to buy and things to do. There's a main game port for larger scale games like Ball Race which... is the 7th layer of hell. XD But I digress. You also start the game with a condo so you can buy stuff and decorate it if you want or even buy a different condo. There's always something to do and something going on and it's still in Early Access so it gets updated regularly. It also means there are still some bugs and things break from time to time, but it doesn't detract from how awesome this game is. I love it very much and I hope if you end up purchasing and playing it, We can be pals! ^_^",Recommended,27,0

As with Early Access games, there are always bugs around and even the character movement is a bit 'meh' but they are still changing everything around, the game is quite playable but a lot of improvement will be made in the next upcoming patches.

Remember GMOD Tower? It's got its own game now.

Really friendly community (perhaps due to the game's nature?), and literally the best bunch of developers I have ever encountered, they take a lot of feedback and interact with its users every single time.

It's in Early Access though, so by the year the game should be done. The game is in a playable state as of now, in comparison to when it first released: lots of bug fixes and implementations have been added. Though, a good advice of mine is to wait, since the game is not yet as optimized as it should be (you make far less FPS than in GMOD Tower itself). This is not an insult to the developers, but rather an encouragement, and I do understand that the game engine switch is actually pretty difficult but optimization for potato PC's should be the developers' main priority when the game is finally done, and I guess that I'm just saying obvious stuff.

Either way, it's a really revolutionary kind of game, since it also brings the nostalgia from the good parts of GMOD Tower and the main core of PlayStation Home.

So yup, just wait a little bit and the game will be the best than ever.",Recommended,23 people found this review helpful 1,3

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's difficult for me to describe what kind of game Tower Unite is like. Although you can play the minigames and attempt to reach the many milestones the game offers, it succeeds the most with it's social aspect and super unrestricted and easy to use condo building which can allow you (and your friends) to build whatever they want. This game shines the most with it's amazing UGC and endless supply of workshop contributions.

Although the community is great at supplying content for the game, the developers are doing much of the same too. There's a lot of care and love put into the game with an overwhelming amount of detail towards everything. The lead developer (MacDGuy) is always listening to what feedback people provide in the discussions page and actively engaging with the community. I've even interacted with him on one occasion in-game, it was awesome. I have a 1000x more respect towards devs who will interact with their community regardless of how bad it can get sometimes. So I personally thank you guys for doing all that you do.

And yeah, the game still does have it's quirks, and maybe sometimes it might just freak out on some days if you stare at it for too long. That's just how it is when it comes to playing anything in Early Access. Despite that though, there's still so much to see and do. There's always something new to discover if you look hard enough.

tl;dr: If you have an itch to play a game that you can always come back to with your friends or generally just wanting to find a ""chill out and talk"" type game which you can totally spend hundreds of hours doing, then this is the game for you.",Recommended,13 people found this review helpful 1,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
When this game first released, I honestly thought it was going to be dead on arrival. Even though GMod Tower had a vibrant, rich, and full-housed history, I honestly thought the hardcore GMod Tower crowd (which included myself) wouldn't be impressed by a new game on a new engine that seemingly promised to carry the massive legacy of it's previous incarnation. Well, I was proven wrong. The launch of the new game was awesome, even though features at the time were bleak and the game had a good amount of obvious bugs, however, most of us at release quickly realized the full extent to which this game could end up becoming. So, I decided to stick around, and the developers ended up fixing many if not all the obvious bugs, but also kept adding more and more content. Me and my friends who were previously always on GMod Tower gave the new one a shot as a group, and we played for hours. The old crowd is back around, and the new crowd is welcoming and just as fun as the glory days back then. I'm happy to say that even though Tower Unite shouldn't be considered a replacement or continuation of GMod Tower due to it's obvious changes, it is most definitely a haven where old players and new players alike can feel the same ""warm fuzzies"" and have a blast exactly how we did in the previous title. The truth is that GMod Tower will forever be lost - those classic Source engine bugs, the 300+ ping everyone had, the overcrowded lobby covered in puke, and the condos that looked like Counter-Strike Source bled into a different reality. However, Tower Unite is only the next chapter in the lives of those who played that original GMod Tower, very similar to how college is for folks who just graduated high-school.

I give this game a 100/100, alongside a personal thank you to the devs who keep the show alive. Godspeed.",Recommended,26,0

This game has a lot of content that you can do, from casino slots to arcade machines and games, minigames, mini golf, mario kart style racing game, ball race, infection gamemode, fishing, lazer tag, bowling, movie theater and more! There are a lot of items to collect to, if you are a collectionist you will like this game. Also, soooo many achievements, for so many different activities, completing these are really a dopamine rush.

There are 2 currencies in the game, Units are the main currency of the game and can be earned from various activities. Second are Tickets which can be earned from the arcade to be used in Arcade specific shop which includes variety of items.

At certain months of the year, there are events happening with new and old event items appearing with event exclusive minigames, plaza events etc. You can collect event coins to purchase these new items, there can be accessories, toys, pets, condo items and more.

There is also a condo system which you can purchase one or more houses and decorate them however you like. You can invite friends or other people to your condo too. The game has a youtube player in it for TVs, laptops and phones so you can play videos or music in condos too.

So the game is packed with content, there are more things that I didn't list or probably missed and there will be more things to come since it is still in active development.

Tower Unite is a virtual game world focused on being involved with the community.

For me, Tower Unite has been a very enjoyable experience. Getting together with friends and socialising through this game has been an absolute blast!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've spent some more time on this game since my review, it's time to change and add onto my original opinions. Tower Unite is pretty much a social MMORPG at it's core, a really good one. If this is something you've been looking for, look no further.

I had a rough start with this game trying to get my grounds and learning how things worked. Some social anxiety preventing me from going out of my comfort zone and interacting with people/asking questions. A game like this strives from social interaction, and thankfully a community like this if you're standing around doing something by yourself it's likely someone with more knowledge will come reach out to you and show you around. This will lead to some new friends that are easy to be made. Before you know it, if you have social anxiety you'll slowly become more comfortable with meeting new people.

The game offers a lot to do. On it's surface, it looks kind of barebones once you've tried out most of the random games you see around. Though you'll realize how many small details there are in the game with different milestones and actually a pretty decent grind in unlocking some things you may want. The best part about all the things to do is it's unlikely you won't find someone else tagging along which makes the experience much more social and enjoyable. If you like grindy games this game can definitely be your cup of tea, it will take a very long time to max everything if that's what you desire. Though this is also completely optional and unnecessary, it really depends what you're seeking from the game.

The game can be played very casually without much of a grind, you can do what sounds like the most fun at the time, and meet new friends on the way. Once you got some friends together you can take it to the next level and join eachothers Condo, which is an extremely in depth player owned house with endless possibilities.

The game shares some similarities to VR Chat (without the VR and force to use voice chat), Garry's Mod (supposedly Tower Unite was originally based in Garry's Mod), and even similarities to Second Life and grindy RPG games. If you like any of those games I think you will enjoy this game. Many very enjoyable minigames, tons of stuff to do and ways to hang out, tons of cosmetics and customization on your player model and your player owned house (Condo).

I highly recommend this game. I've already had so much fun and met so many amazing people. I look forward to see what the game has in store in the future. It's been in Early Access a long time yet it still receives updates regularly. The game is not dead.",Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 0,0

This game is absurdly slept on. It's got a lot of content, it's addicting, and there's something fun to do for everyone. Arcades, Casinos, Fishing, Shooters, Movie Theaters, Night Clubs, and that's not even part of the user-generated content like Video Game Museums, Live Concerts, Community Events.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Successor to the great Gmod Tower, Tower Unite is a stand alone version with an almost an endless stream of new possibilities to offer. Tower Unite IS in early access as I currently write this which leads many to say it is ""not worth buying right now."" I argue that weather you buy it now or during later updates it is most definitely a must have if you're big into socializing and just having a nice place to unwind after a long day of work or play. Despite it being under construction the dev team works around the clock to bring quality content and beautiful visuals. The plans they have for the game down the road are amazing and I'm beyond excited to see them unfold.

Both the game play and social aspects are very diverse and very fun. Sometimes I think of Tower as an amusement park, or a playground. They provide us with the tools, and it's up to us the players to enjoy ourselves and encourage one another. The core of Towers players are amazing, passionate, diverse, friendly, and wonderful people. It's hard to play this game and not make a few new friends along the way.

I have the utmost faith in Tower Unites developers to bring quality content in the future. They're amazing hard working people who listen to community feedback and understand that respect and understanding are powerful tools to make a great community.

TL ; DR : Early access or not, Tower Unite gets a 10/10
The game is fantastic and I know for a fact it will only get better as time go's on.",Recommended,36,0

GOTTA GO FAST!

When I first heard of Clustertruck it seemed like a silly game that would only entertain me for 5 minutes at best.
Boy was I wrong, not only is Clustertruck an extremely fun adrenaline rush with great replayability, but it also got me hooked to the point that I played through all the levels in one sitting. All there is to this game is jumping from truck to truck while dodging obstacles, which can sound quite boring, but the real fun starts when you treat it as a parkour speedrunning game by trying to complete everything as fast as you can. Went through all the levels? Buy some upgrades and do it again. Upgrades sometimes drastically change the way you play by adding interesting mechanics. Completed it again? Get some friends together and challenge eachother, see who can beat a level the fastest.

For being such a simple game, Clustertruck is a surprisingly fun and replayable parkour speedrunning game. I highly recommend anyone who is on the fence to give it a try.",Recommended,266,2

Clustertruck.
Just my kind of clusterf*ck!

The Bumpersticker
Clustertruck is a high-octane, frenetic, responsive, and chaotically enjoyable first-person platformer. The game, oversimplified, is about running and jumping across levels filled with obstacles, on which only large semi-trucks are safe to come in contact with. Its single-minded tactile fun, and it’s unapologetic about it, much in the vein of games like DOOM (2016) or SUPERHOT. Clustertruck takes speed, skill, polished level design – and big explosions – and wraps them all together into one hell of a ride.

The Trailer
Clustertruck’s campaign is short and sweet, yet packed full of quality. Each progressing level introduces nuances that keeps the game difficult, but never infuriating. In this sense, every stage is a puzzle, and it’s the player’s objective to solve it in the fastest, most wicked way possible. As you jump from truck to truck you build momentum, which, when combo’d correctly, can send you hurtling at ridiculous speeds past several obstacles. This speed, however, will only make it harder to land on the next truck with precision. There are abilities to earn with style-points as well, such as the power to slow down time, or use a grapple hook to catch yourself from a level-restarting fall. This spattering of mechanics allows you to be creative in your approach, and are what fundamentally drives the gameplay.


Though not the most fun or inventive game made, Clustertruck certainly holds its own as a one-of-a-kind gameplay experience. There are other elements I could have mentioned, such as the graphics, the soundtrack, or even the competitive element of the game. But none of those are the reason you should play Clustertruck. The reason to play Clustertruck is that it’s good old-fashioned video game badassery, and that’s getting pretty rare these days.",Recommended,63,16

Insanely fun and super addictive!

Here are some things to rememeber though

- It's not a game you can sit down and play for hours on end, it will get boring at some point but if you have short stretches of time for say, 10-30 minutes, this is the perfect game

- It is definetly not worth the original $15 price, I purchased the game during the Summer Sale 2017 for $4.94 (plus tax) and I think that's the perfect price for a newish game with limited story but great, interactive, and relaxing gameplay",Recommended,51,0

Get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in clustertruck! Clustertruck is a first person platformer where you are tasked with jumping off trucks traveling over a variety of stages and reaching a goal. The game is quite silly with trucks flying all over the place and mass carnage being common. Not too bad.

Good
-pretty fun mayhem
-level editor and steam workshop support for lots of user made stages
-feels fast
-sound and graphics do the job and have a sort of nice style in their own way

-you die a lot, often frustratingly or unfairly
-random element in the trucks behavior means sometimes levels will be uncompleatable or much more difficult

Clustertruck.

Simple game in all the plan.

According to graphics, it's simple, linear.

No story on this game, you don't know at all who you are, what you're doing here and why you're doing this.

OST is some kind of electronic music, really speed, like the gamplay.

The gameplay is simple. Jump!
As a standart platformer, you cant fall, and this is the tricky part, you have to jump from truck to truck, which are rollin', and by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ driver.
You have to take care of the physics of the game, inertia, speed of the trucks and obviously to all the traps the game is full of.

Smooth gameplay,

Just beat ""Clustertruck"". What an absolutely phenomenal game. I have been following it's development since alpha when it was called ""Super Highway Fight Squad"" (glad they changed the name, isn't as catchy lol). For a game that is relatively simplistic in design, run on trucks don't touch the floor, it is INCREDIBLY polished. The soundtrack is full of great peppy synth and rock ballads, the graphics are smooth and pleasant, the controls are tight, and there are a ton of levels. 80 in fact. Oh, and there is an extremely robust level creator which I am very excited to see the user created content for in the Steam workshop. If you are looking for a fun, challenging, and bonkers game look no further than

This may be my favorite ""rage"" game ever. The controls are crazy responsive, everything feels smooth, and finishing a level just feels so rewarding! I've played many games like this before and usually I start feeling frustrated or irritated, and mostly it's because the game just tries to be ridiculously impossible. But when you fail here, it feels like only you're to blame, and it feels like more of a challenge to beat it rather than frustration. This game also offers incredible replayibility, since there are 100 levels. And the more you play, the more abilities you unlock, which makes it even more enjoyable going back and replaying previous levels. Definitely worth buying!

No real trucks were harmed in playing this game.

But srsly though, I recommend this game because:
- The game is easy at first, but once you get further, it gets challenging, yet still fun to beat.
- Amazing level design and graphics.
- The music is the best. (Especially the laser world, which I personally like.)
- Different abilities to modify your truck-jumping experience.
- Workshop support. Create your own custom maps.

A game this good also has some cons:
- Somewhat short of a game. Needs more levels.
- Some few overlooked bugs present.

Clustertruck is a first-person view platformer with a very fun, yet simple objective, jump from truck to truck until you eventually reach the end of a level. Though lacking in a few features most FPV games usually have, this game is fun and will eventually enthrall you. Its graphics, controls, and appearance may initially appear to be bland and simplistic, but you'll eventually realize how a lot was done with so little.

CT is a game that's purely about gameplay, there's no story here at all and while that may dissuade some from playing this game, I had no problem with that at all. CT's control scheme is simple to the point where you won't be using more than 5 buttons in the whole game. It's possible to play (while using an xbox 360 controller) just using the left thumbstick and the A button, but some special abilities will eventually require the use of one or two more additional buttons.

As I previously mentioned, the main goal of this game is to advance through each of the 90 levels by jumping from truck to truck. The final level also features an unexpected ""surprise"" that isn't encountered elsewhere in the game. The levels are all separated into 9 unique worlds with their own separate environment specific traps, obstacles, and music to keep things fresh. (It's refreshing to play through a game where you aren't forced to listen to a limited number of tracks being endlessly repeated) An example of the levels/environments uniqueness would be the hell themed environment where you have to avoid lava, a forest environment with loads of green landscape, trees (they won't get in your way), and even a futuristic looking environment.

On the subject of the levels/environments, it's also worth mentioning that this game has holiday specific levels. These holiday specific levels are great, but I assume they only unlock during the time the holiday is celebrated. Being that it's October, I could only play through the Halloween levels, but I couldn't play through the Christmas levels. I wanted to play them almost immediately after having beaten the Halloween levels because it's more or less extra content and these holiday specific levels offered unique traps/obstacles.

I'd also like to mention that touching obstacles, traps, the ground, and generally anything other than the trucks will lead to an instant death. For that reason alone, you'll want to always jump onto the roof of each truck, it's usually the most secure way to get through a level. Should your jump not have been good enough, there's also the chance to grab onto the back of a truck. There are a few instances in which you can touch something else as a way to maneuver through the level, but this is usually a rare occurrence.

I've previously mentioned that this game is simplistic in more ways than one, but the game is designed in such a way that it'll eventually become much harder. The trucks will vary in speed/distance from each other, the different levels/environments will offer traps to make things more difficult, and the precision required to make even the simplest jump will at times lead to you having to replay through a level. The game's possibilities will also come off as a double-edged sword. You can stick to playing it safe through this game by jumping to nearby trucks, but you'll also have the possibility to skip over trucks by use of long distance jumping and if used correctly, you'll also be able to group together jumps so it feels like one giant interconnected, fluid motion. This in particular feels really cool to do and it'll allow you to get through the levels even faster.

For the most part, the levels can be beaten in one or two tries, but a few towards the middle/end of this game will require multiple attempts. It's usually the very specific levels/environments that require the most effort to get through. Even though you'll have to repeat these later levels multiple times, the respawns are almost instantaneous and the levels aren't too long (some levels can literally be beaten in a matter of seconds), it won't really bother you that much if/when you die a lot.

Honestly, there wasn't that much I didn't enjoy about this game. What I found to be bothersome didn't ruin the game at all, but I felt there were some things that I felt could've been different/improved upon to make this game even better than it is. One thing that's almost immediately noticed is that your character (if you can even call it that) in this game is more or less an invisible entity. Arms, legs, or even a combination of both would've been useful. It's funny that you play as a shapeless figure, but sometimes your movements felt stiff. As a result of lacking any discernible shape, landing precise/correctly timed jumps can be a bit troublesome when you first start playing through this game.

Even after I got the hang of this game, landing jumps were still a hassle to deal with, especially when I had to land on a moving truck from a long distance. In this game jumps have to be measured by sight, but things would've been much easier if you had a cross hairs or something to aim your jumps with. A special ability eventually gives you something like cross hairs, but it's not available by default and you have to accumulate points before you're able to unlock it.

The game has quite a few special abilities that you can choose to use/unlock, but you can only equip two at the same time. A few of them are the ability to freeze time for a brief moment, a double jump, and a grappling hook. Honestly, some of the special abilities didn't feel quite special. A specific example would be how the double jump works in this game. Your default first jump is very high, but if you unlock and use the double jump, it's not as good as the initial jump, it'll more or less grant you a brief moment of hang time in the air. There's a very particular way to jump off of the back of a truck that'll allow you to jump really high, which is much more helpful than the double jump, but it's difficult to use. You can go through most of the game without having to use these special abilities and it won't horribly affect your enjoyment of this game. There will be some levels that'll require additional assistance in the form of the special abilities, but the number of them is very few.

Besides those problems, I also felt that some of the game's levels lacked direction. For the most part, the levels are linear and they'll always require you to go forward. You'll eventually reach a point where that isn't the case and you'll have to eventually turn backwards to advance or even descend to lower parts of the level. My problem with this is that it isn't easy to figure this out and it'll require a few deaths until you figure out what you need to do. Others may find this problematic because the game offers bonus points for beating a level in one attempt.

Despite having a fun main campaign that consists of 90 levels and additional holiday levels, CT is a short game. I didn't try to rush through the game and I still managed to beat it in three hours. Not only did it take me three hours, I was able to beat two thirds of the game in one night. Maybe it's because I found the game to be that entertaining, but my experience with this game went by too quickly. There are some gamers out there that will enjoy the game due to being able to quickly play through the game and move onto something else, but at the same time there'll be others out there that really like getting the most bang out of their buck.

To conclude, I highly enjoyed CT and I could see myself coming back at a later time to play the Christmas levels. CT is proof why many more people should pay more attention to indie gaming. It takes a simple formula, but still manages to create a fun and unique experience. I most definitely recommend this game.",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 0,0

I have just finished my first playthrough blind and pure(no abilities)... This game taught me...

How to be rubbish at parkour
I am the worst gamer
Pizza is the best comfort food
I hate lasers
I don't do well underpressure
I have no patience and I don't know how to control my tempter
""I'm not allowed powers"" is not a valid reason for refunds

Main Review

This is basically the floor is lava. You jump from truck to truck to reach the end goal. However, its not so simple! Terrible drivers, lasers, rockets, and many more obastacles try to stop your progress along the way! You earn style points and is the currency to buy ability points to make the game easier/interesting such as slow motion or double jump.

So, I played this in the beta or alpha... I had a blast and patiently waited for its release! Bought it out sale and I don't regret buying this game.

The level design is fantastic! There is also steam workshop so you can get creative with level creator! The game is short if you are just playing and unlocking abilities (aroud 4-5 hours I'd say.)

Online leader boards mean you can compete with the world or your friends to try and get the best score/speed. SO much replay value in this game!

Honestly, they took a basic concept and made it into a great game. I highly recommend you buy it or at least wait for a sale! 8/10",Recommended,67,0

If you like parkour or bunny hopping this game is for you!

- Graphics are very good for this type of game
- There are many different levels to play, including workshop ones
- Music is sometimes good sometimes kinda boring and too chill for fast paced game
- There are many different super powers that you can buy and use
- Mechanics are hard at first, but when you get hang of it, you will rock
- Game has ladder rankings, so you can compete with your friends at who gets faster time and better score
- Includes level editor, if you want to test your creativity

Overall game is pretty good and a little bit to expensive for what it has to offer, but if you are buying it on sale it is worth it!",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 0,0

TOP 3 FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️Slowing down time.
⭐️Jumping from truck to truck.
⭐️Watching the chaos unfold in front of you.

THE UNIQUES:
💎Parkour, with trucks!
💎Community workshop.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼Parkour.
💼Fast Paced.
💼First-Person.

VERDICT:
It's very original when it comes to it's parkour, I don't think I've ever seen a game like this before. Sadly the game is pretty short but theirs plenty of workshop games to enjoy if you're that invested into the game, I was satisfied with what I played and don't intend to delve deeper into the workshop but it's easy to jump back into since the download is very small so who knows! I struggled with a handful of the levels but with enough practice, you can get through these levels.

I'd suggest getting this on sale, it's certainly not worth the asking price as it stands.
Total Score = 79/100.

SIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:
Nothing I've come across is like this game.

GAMEPLAY:
In Clustertruck, the player controls a character from a first-person perspective. They are set to jump onto a moving line of trucks, avoiding obstacles and truck pile-ups and crashes. The player is usually unable to touch anything other than trucks, and will otherwise fail their task of reaching the goal at the end of the level.

One of the best level-based platformers in awhile.

Pros:
-Hilarious. As soon as you turn on this game you're left laughing at how stupid these truck drivers are, and it only gets better when you see the waterfalls of trucks (truckerfalls?)
-Really fast pacing; even when you fail you restart immediately and the levels are fast and fun to try to get good times on. It's clear this game was created for those who like to do speedruns, as IIRC one of the game testers also did speedruns of it on his youtube channel
-Very creative level design as the game goes on, leading to ""Oh ♥♥♥♥ I'm a God"" moments when you succeed
-Challenging, but mostly fair
-Creative powerups that are fun to tinker with
-User-created levels add tons of replayability

Cons:
-It's not quite 100% clear where your feet are. Sometimes (level 9-2 comes to mind) it's not the easiest to know where I am going to land after a jump.
-Because of the speed, turning is not the easiest to figure out and sometimes you fail because you aren't sure where you're going to land until it's too late
-Some levels either require specific power-ups or absolutely Ninja like movement to beat (In World 7 I had to jump from a falling truck to another falling truck to beat it without a powerup, and that boiled down to good RNG)
-Music is okay, but nothing spectacular

Absolutely worth 15$. Most faults are minor or made up for by the rest of this fun, silly platformer.",Recommended,25,0

So after 2 hours of playing the campaign - 100 levels. It was alot of fun.

Pros:
- Challenging and Addicting.
- Insane structured levels, ESPECIALLY THE SCI FI - World 7
- Perks and abilities (Speed trucks/ slow down time)
- Amazing boss battle
- Decent Graphics, at least it not for beefy computers.
- Workshop/Editor where you can make your own custom levels
- Gravity and other obstacles fly in your way and can change the pace of the game, quickly!

Cons:
-Too short campaign for a $15 game. Can be finished in 2-3 hours. Need more levels and bosses
-Only Three modes. Campaign and Custom Maps/Editor. Besides leaderboards, there's technically no multiplayer mode.
-Workshop levels don't look that good, the community needs time to develop more amazing levels.
-A few bugs, such as you cant view all the achievements from shift-tab or the game not starting up.

In conclusion, the game deserves a solid 8/10. The Devs did a good job on making a game extremely fun, but the fun lasts short. More levels and modes are needed for a $15 game. I do recommend getting this game but it would feel more worth it if it was on a sale.",Recommended,43,0

Slippery hitboxes vs. inconsistent physics... this motherf*cker is merciless. But I can't remember the last time a game so effortlessly plunged me into a trance-like state where my body couldn't help but lean in all directions while my mouth constantly spewed the most ghoulish obscenities known to man almost involuntarily. It has to count for something! So, if you are willing to reject humanity and return to monke for a few amusingly frustrating hours, here's your ticket.

Imagine Super Mario. But without Mario and without blocks.
There are Trucks, and the trucks are moving, and they’re on fire and exploding while crashing or falling down into the abyss while they’re exploding even more!

You need to jump from Truck to Truck, avoid the obstacles and reach the finish line.That’s pretty much all. But it’s so much fun! Also with the time you can unlock abilities, like a double jump, air dash or slow down the time for example.
There are high score lists to compare your time against your friends or the rest of the world. If you saw the trailer and think “looks kinda cool” I absolutely recommend you to try this game!",Recommended,55,4

well first off i met the devs of this game and they gave it to me for free so thanks for that :D

this game is a good game with cool lighting funny jokes and a final boss. it has a level editor wich makes you able to create own levels altho it you might find it hard to move the camera at first. you can do awesome flips and you will likely find yourself returning if you have not played it for a while overall this game is a 7.5 out of 10.

also the devs have been known to hack into twitch streams to change the trucks collours to the streamers favourite collours.

TL;DR: If you are a veteran of air movement and a purist you will not have fun. Otherwise yeah this is a good game you should play it and jam to the music.

Let me start out by saying that I 100%'ed the game in 7.5 hours. My first playthrough was pure; meaning I beat every level without using any abilities and I chose to do this before I even knew there was an achievement for doing so.

I consider myself pretty good at going fast and flying through the air as I've spent hundreds of hours rocketjumping and surfing in TF2 and CSGO. So you would think this game was a perfect fit for me, and so did I until I played it.

So why the negative review? To be quite frank, it comes down to a couple simple principles that I believe in when it comes down to design.
1: Speed should be encouraged. (this is after all a game about going fast) In reality it is about going at whatever speed the game decides because going to fast will result in constantly running out of trucks to jump on making levels unbeatable.
2: The RNG is just painful. The trucks wildly swerve about and throw themselves off cliffs, and almost all of the stage hazards and mechanics are also entirely RNG based so there is very little actual use of skill and the game devolves into a waiting game for the planets to align and for a run to even be possible to complete.
3: The controls are weak and the physics are poor. Much of my experience in air control comes from the Source Engine, which for all its faults has incredibly tight and crisp control in the air. If I make a mistake in TF2 or CSGO it is my fault. This game however... oh boy. You run forward incredibly quickly, but side to side movement is almost nonexistent. Turning in the air is a nightmare and the sudden velocity increase when falling from any decent height results in you suddenly plummeting to the ground when you thought you might gracefully maneuver onto a truck.

So did I like anything about the game? The music for the most part is great. The last 3 worlds are a bit lacking and out of character but for the most part I enjoyed the music quite a bit. Now here's the real surprise coming from an elitist like myself: I actually quite like the abilities. They give interesting options for movement although some are vastly better than others and there are some silly combos. Once I finished the game I went back and actually used the abilities to have some fun and probably will continue to do so from time to time in the future.

This is getting lengthy so let's wrap it up. Would I recommend this game to someone who had interests similar to myself and would want to 100% the game if they played it? No. It is frustrating and stupid more than anything and I had to unlearn everything I previously knew about air control to work with the awful controls. Would I recommend this game to a more casual person who will use abilities and probably has no background in air movement like I do? Yes.

So yeah, my enjoyment was crushed by the way I chose to experience the game. If I could give the game a middle ground review I would because it does have merit for the casual fan, but for someone like myself this game was just horrendous to play through and I can't recommend it because of the issues I raised above.",Not Recommended,75,3

Short version:

Pros:

+ Cool soundtrack

Cons:
- Some randomization can lead to frustration

""Long"" version:
is a first-person platformer where you hop from truck to truck until you get to the finish line. It was developed by Landfall and published by tinyBuild.

What a great surprise this game was.
When I go for a game, I usually know what to expect – the genre, what type of gameplay it has, etc. Not here, not with .
I was bored, scrolling through my library, hoping to find something to play. I saw the cheeky title for the game but I could not really figure out what it was about.
When you first start out, you immediately get thrown into the action and I remember being super confused as to what was happening. That confusion only lasted a few seconds, however. After a few retries, I understood what I had to do and I was hooked.

Let me go into detail about a few things.

The game does not have a story mode.
It has 9 worlds with 10 levels each, 2 extra worlds celebrating Halloween and Christmas and custom maps.

Gameplay is great.
You must jump from truck to truck in order to get to the finish line – the first few levels are rather easy but the game gets increasingly crazier. It is so over the top that I found myself grinning like a lunatic a few times.
Trucks drive off edges, they are shot by huge ballista bolts and explode, they get warped by light beacons, you name it. While all of this is happening, you have to keep moving and cannot touch anything besides the trucks – environmental hazards kill you, walls and the ground do too.
The more you jump and “wall run” (or, in this case, “truck run”?) the fast you become and it is super satisfying to nail tricky jumps at top speed.
Each world features around 2 new mechanics that spice things up so does not get too repetitive.

The game is challenging but not blatantly hard.
You get scores based on your speed and how stylish your moves are. If you are having trouble with a level, most levels allow you to take you time and play it safe.
After finishing a level, you are awarded currency which can be used to unlock new abilities, like a double jump or a dash forward. These make the game much easier but you do not need to use them to complete levels and can even disable them from the start.
While a lot of levels left an impression on me, I must talk about one in particular. No spoilers but the final level is insane and goes all out. I loved it.

My biggest gripe is that levels tend to have tiny randomizations when it comes to truck placement. You should be fine memorizing most steps you need to finish on most maps but sometimes you will find trucks acting differently – it is especially evident towards the latter levels, where a lot of debris is thrown around and it randomizes everything. Totally not a deal-breaker but it did frustrate me a bit.

Graphically, looks amazing. The minimalistic art style really suits it and it does not distract you from the action.
Each world feels super distinct and exudes personality and charm.

The sound effects are rather basic but totally serviceable.
The soundtrack, however, is super high energy and hypes you up for some truck-surfing.

You are looking at around 6-8 hours’ worth of gameplay and a bunch more if you go for all DLC and try out a few custom maps.


It is an easy recommendation – it is fun, fast-paced and thrilling.

Final score: 8.5 out of 10.

Clustertruck is a game that gives you exactly what you expect. A platforming game where you jump between different clusters of trucks. The difficulty of the game hit a sweet spot for me, where it wasn't so easy that I finished it in a sitting, but wasn't so difficult that I couldn't make progress. That being said, I beat the game within the week I bought it, achievements included. There is an expansive workshop to select custom maps, so there isn't really an end to the content that you can play through.

If you're playing to try and be #1 on the leaderboards though, good luck, all of the #1 times are hackers, js.",Recommended,14,0

This is one of the most wildly original games I have seen in a long time.

Clustertruck's basic premise is this: you run and jump across the back of trucks that are speeding down various landscapes. Your objective is to get to the goal by any means necessary. But if you touch anything or bump anything that isn't a truck (well, almost anything), you fail and have to restart the level. It sounds hard, and it is hard, but it's also crazy fun. There's no feeling like being absolutely certain you're about to fail and then somehow turning it around into a victory.

To help matters, you earn points as you play and you can use them to buy abilities. These abilities range from things like double jump and slowing down time to making the game play like SUPERHOT. They're all interesting and offer ridiculous new ways to tackle levels.

Now some might be upset with the fact that you can pretty much see all the levels in just 2-3 hours, but the levels that are there are great. They start off fairly tame, easing you into the game and letting you get a handle on how it all works. But the game gradually ramps up the difficulty, adding new and crazier things as the levels go on. You get lasers, boulders, trucks falling from the sky, trucks being shot out of cannons at you, missile launching turrets, and more. And I found all the levels to be fun.

Well, except for the final level. I won't spoil what it is, but those who have gotten there will know what I'm talking about.

Here's the thing: Clustertruck is built around speed. It's all about getting things done as fast as you can, and the levels reflect that. Each one can usually be completed in 10-20 seconds at most. But then the final level comes along, and it forces you to play for at least two minutes. And if you slip up, make a mistake, and fail? Well you're back at the beginning. And it quickly gets frustrating. The concept is cool, and an interesting variation on the tradition levels, but in the end it just makes the tiny flaws in Clustertruck suddenly become all the more glaring. The momentum can be wonky as you jump from truck to truck. The inherent randomness in the game means that the trucks can act unpredictably. And if that happens at the wrong time, you die because of it. These flaws normally don't mean much because of how fast each level is, but the final level can become insanely frustrating as you continually retry it over and over just trying to get back to where you were.

Despite all that, Clustertruck is a great game and I highly recommend it. It's one of the most creative game ideas I've ever seen. And it's only the final level that annoyed me. The rest could be challenging, but they were still fun. That being said, if you don't think fifteen bucks is worth only a few hours of content, then I'd wait for a sale. Either way, it'll certainly be one of the most unique games you ever purchase.

EDIT: I just found out that the developers made the final level a little shorter to alleviate some of the frustration. Good on them. I'm glad they listen to feedback unlike some in the industry.",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 0,0

Clustertruck is a wacky parkour physics game where you jump across trucks. Since there's no story, we're jumping straight to graphics.

Graphics:

Clustertruck is a very simplistic looking game, but very easy on the eyes. Usually most levels won't be complex visually to allow you to completely focus on the platforming. Most worlds you visit are very distinct from one another and actually look very nice, my favorite one being the sci fi one, with buildings and roads covered in lights.

Apart from that the only other thing you're mostly gonna look at is the trucks, which are just plain white trucks which look the part. It's a very minimalistic game visually, but that's fine because it's all about the gameplay.

Audio:

Music is decent and actually fits the games fast pace really well. It's nice and easy on there considering all the other crazy going on like explosions, car crashes and other stuff going on at the same time. The audio overall is very par on course on what I expected, albeit a few of the tracks could have been more action packed,, but overall still very decent.

Gameplay:

This is the meat of the game and Clustertruck nails this without a doubt. The basic goal is to go from point A to B in the fastest time possible, you do this by platforming on trucks that are driving towards the finish line, but they won't stop for anything and will ram through anything in their way.

The first world starts off simple to allow you to understand the jumping mechanics and the fact you can slow down time so you can properly land your jumps, but quite soon the game ramps up in difficulty when new obstacles are introduced. Stuff like lasers, cannons and other trucks, will try to destroy the trucks you're standing on or sometimes there's going to be debris flying at you and once you land on the ground you die.

The main levels are actually incredibly fun and the right amount of challenge, as no matter how hard the game became I never felt frustrated. I felt the mechanics worked fine and often it was my mistakes that killed me. However I will say sometimes physics will mess up and the trucks will veer off and make it much difficult to make it to the end, it's a very rare thing to happen, but it does happen enough to make it annoying. Each world also adds unique threats that act as bonus obstacles to try and destroy you and it actually keeps the gameplay fresh, world to world.

Verdict:

Clustertruck is a great little game, that I had an absolute blast playing. It only took me 3 hours to finish all the worlds, but there's plenty of other stuff like an in game editor and replaying other levels that could extend your playtime, in case you want more after you're done with the main game. I definitely recommend checking this one out.

Final Rating:
8/10

Pros:
+ Incredibly addictive gameplay
+ Unique challenges to each world
+ Right amount of challenge

Cons:
- Physics sometimes act up and make it hard to progress
- Main campaign is pretty short

Come for the pun, stay for the endless torment that is stage 9-10.
Honestly, it's a simple yet beautiful game with a single key mechanic - jump on trucks to reach the goal. There's just enough RNG at play to keep the repetition fresh - and some levels will challenge you more than you'd expect. Some stages definitely felt more like a Dark Souls grind than any truck-based parkour game has any right to.

Beautiful aesthetic, stunning soundtrack, and great gameplay. Try and beat the game with no abilities first - it'll make you feel like you've earned the victory.",Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 0,0

TL;DR: Even at full price, this game is worth it and gives you incredible levels that make you feel like a god, awesome powerups, diverse worlds, a level editor, and frequent seasonal updates.

What I've learned from this game is I am a badass. Everything in this game, from the music to the obstacles to the damn cool powerups makes you feel like you earned whatever you've accomplished. Although some worlds are challenging (♥♥♥♥ YOU STEAMPUNK WORLD), all of them are diverse with each world taking on a completely different theme from the last, and introduce some new aspect to the game, like no-gravity sections, or jump pads, or giant boulders. I also don't know what it is about this game, but I always feel encouraged to try to beat my friends in the levels, though I believe the game still suffers from hackers breaking the global scoreboard. The visuals aren't outstanding, but they don't have to be (obviously) and the whole low-poly-but-not-severely style fits the game great, and the explosions are really satisfying too. Finally, the level editor and steam workshop let you share epic levels you've created and keep you entertained between seasonal updates.",Recommended,17,0

Gameplay
The gameplay in this game is amazing, its incredibly simple, but is very well designed and feels satisfying, I completed the game without using the abilities (as there is an achievement to do so), and even without them I found every level played perfectly, some will make you think outside of the box, others will just take some time to master a perfect run.

Graphics/performance
With a simple premise comes a simple art style, which is fine as you want the game to run well if you are going to enjoy it. I don’t recall having any issues while playing, and it should run well on most systems.

Value
I appreciate when a developer prices their game appropriately, at around £11 this game will give you hours of enjoyment.

This is a great game that I imagine most people will enjoy at some level.",Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 0,0

I don't even know why I subject myself to torture but when you somehow ♥♥♥♥♥♥ make it to the second last level you just want to complete the final one and get it over and done with!!!

Some people have complained that it's very dependent on RNG, and I must say that yes it is a really frustrating part of the game. If you want one with ACTUAL SKILL involved, check out LOVELY PLANET. Now that one is significantly more satisfying and well made, with better art and music.

Clustertruck is a singleplayer game were the ""floor is lava"" you have to jump on the back of semi trucks to make it to the finish line all while dodging and avoiding obstacles.
Being quick is essential, if you hit an obstacle, touch the ground or fail to beat the timer the level will restart.
Some may find it difficult but the satisfaction of completion is worth it.

This game will make you want to destroy the human race, but in a good way. It is insanely difficult, and you WILL ragequit at some point. However, it is very addicting, and kind of amazing. Trying out different powerups and abilities, doing your best at increasingly ridiculous levels, and then raging and throwing your computer out a window is all good fun.

Clustertruck is a parkour speedrun truck-jumping game with a floor-is-lava twist. Is it worth buying?

For the picture-filled review, read it on the Games Worth Buying website - http://www.gamesworthbuying.com/2016/10/26/clustertruck-review/

If you are lucky enough to have had an even remotely decent childhood, chances are you have played a game where you act as though the floor is a fiery pit of lava. The rules of the game are simple, and all kids, no matter their race, colour or creed, have an innate, almost spooky inner knowing of them. You jump from one piece of furniture to the next, and you must not, under any circumstance, fall off, or else you will end up on the carpet in the deadly lava, resulting in your ultimate doom.

Clustertruck is similar in a way, with the basic fundamentals much like that of the old game that those of us not living under a rock know and used to love, except the pieces of furniture are moving and they are now trucks driven by drunks. Of course they are.

The entire game is pretty much that. You jump from truck to truck in minimalist graphics and well designed but sometimes – actually a lot of the time – annoying but great levels. It’s fun.

Chaos and destruction, including trucks driving off the edge to their impending explosive deaths, are a normal sight in Clustertruck, and it’s absolutely spectacular. It’s not so spectacular when you’re relying on that truck making it to the end of the level, though, which happens quite often. Almost all of the game consists of evading obstacles that can make the truck below you blow up, for instance swinging hammers, flamethrowers, walls, bits of the floor getting pushed up, and other trucks.

The game movement is slippery and somewhat difficult to get used to. After over seven hours of playing the game, I’m still struggling. That’s not a downside though, it adds to the challenge and makes it more fun. There are also a few movement-based bugs (are they bugs? I can’t figure out whether they were intended), such as launching myself up off the tailgate of a truck and flinging across the levels, and using the grapple hook ability to just ignore the map and Spiderman over completely.

Spanned across nine worlds, the 90 official Clustertruck levels are a great enjoyment, especially when you’ve just aced one in one try. There is also Steam Workshop support, so as well as the official levels, you can subscribe to and download a bunch more, hand crafted by the community in the game’s level editor. Although there are only a few very good Workshop levels, it’s still pretty cool to see what creations others have brewed up.

It took me around four hours to finish all the Landfall-made levels, so I decided to try the community levels and that took up another few hours of my time.

At first glance, Clustertruck’s custom level editor looked complicated to me, but shortly after digging in and building a couple of terrible levels, I soon got the hang of it. Placing buildings, roads and dangerous traps and making trucks drive in their own paths is reasonably easy, and if I got stuck, I’d just use the relatively long and detailed help sheet.

Clustertruck has an unlockable ability system where you can use in-game points that you accumulate through playing and completing the game’s levels to purchase numerous different powers including jetpacks, slow motion, grapple hooks and levitation. This, for me, takes away the feel of the game I had hoped for, and although it’s another feature (and features are good), I would have suggested that they just scratch that idea and build the game with the initial raw, truck jumping feeling.

The game’s AI paths vary ever so slightly from game to game; sometimes you can ride a truck to the end, sometimes it’ll veer off causing a major crash, resulting in the deaths of both you and fifteen truck drivers. This is great as it adds a certain amount of randomness, but it can also be level-breaking, like all of the trucks crashing, leaving the level impossible to finish.

When I first heard about Clustertruck I was skeptical, and to a degree I still am, because I think the concept is great, but I’m not quite sure whether it’s big enough to deserve its own title.

I’m torn this time because of that. I would recommend buying it when it goes on special, but if you think you would enjoy it and wish to purchase it at its current US$15, then there’s nothing inside me that would try to convince you otherwise. It’s considerably short but it’s still brilliant fun, and for that reason I will have to say:",Recommended,20,4

Clustertruck is basically what happens if someone takes the whole ""look how goofy and kinda broken Unity's physics engine is!"" genre, epitomized by Goat Simulator, and makes an actual game out of it. The result is a speedrun-focused platformer, with the platforms being trucks that obey wacky Unity physics.

The result is expectedly fun, and most of the levels are designed well enough that they don't become frustrating even when you keep dying to the slippery controls or unusual physics, but it shares a downside with many games like this where it's quite easy to get stuck on a single level and not really have fun any more, because the game is completely linear and all levels must be successfully completed in order to unlock the next.

(The ""final boss"" stage gets a special mention, however - Clustertruck mostly manages to not be frustrating despite combining slippery controls, wacky physics, and major errors requiring you to restart the run by having most stages be short. The final stage is... not, and suffers a lot from that.)

I would recommend Clustertruck to most people who enjoy action games and especially to people who have subjected themselves to Unity's default physics before, as seeing it become an actual game rather than just Goat Simulator was extra funny for me. It's not a terribly long game unless you want to replay stages to improve your score, but given its single gimmick, that's to be expected.",Recommended,12 people found this review helpful 0,0

I would just like to say that I really like this game, not only because of the concept in general, but also because every level is very unique and it feels fresh every time you start a new level. The game also has a good difficulty curve (maybe idk, I haven't even completed the game yet lol)

I mainly like to speedrun the individual levels, and it needs more good runners in the no abilities-category because I feel like it's too easy to get a top 10 or a world record on most of the levels.

So yeah, pretty fun game",Recommended,12,0

+ Wow, this game is fun!!! You are essentially riding on top of moving Semi Trucks, jumping between each one, while also trying to avoid a large variety of obstacles, while also doing the most insane mid-air maneuvers at high speed while things are exploding all around you. It's chaotic, it's a bit silly, but it is so much fun!
+ Wide variety of abilities to unlock that change up how you play. Things like double jumping, time control, grapple, teleport, and some rather crazy modifiers that can be fun to mess with.
+ A large amount of content. 90 levels total with a boss at the end and steam workshop
+ Very challenging. Although it may ""seem"" easy there is actually a large learning curve while getting used to the controls and the way the physics behave in this game. Once you get some skill though....the game becomes even more thrilling...even on a second playthrough.
+ Great for speedrunners. The sense of speed is fantastic, and jumping through the air doing all sorts of amazing tricks while being encouraged to go as fast as you can is just a joy along with leaderboard support.
+ Visually the game looks great. Very bright and colorful with a different themed environment that changes every 10 levels.
+ The level design is great, every level is unique and filled with surprises, new obstacles, and challenges to solve.
+ Good soundtrack

- Although there is a lot of abilities to play with, I feel like only 2 are ever worth while to use. (double jump, and slowing down time)",Recommended,16,1

tldr: it's aight
the good:
-custom levels allows for more replayability, although these can vary in quality.
-easy to learn, hard to master: the game has like three buttons, but can actually get fairly tough towards the end.
-world design: each world (of which there are 9) has its own theme, which is pretty cool
-records/leaderboards: allows for more replayability, although I don't care too much about that.
neutral:
items: they add to cool stuff you might pull off, but they can vary in quality and in viability. at least they give an objective to grind to.
the bad:
-time/price: I have four hours in this game. In these four hours, I have beaten the main story, some of the themed worlds, and a fair amount of custom levels. This game cost me about $10, but it can go on sale for cheaper. Buy it when it's like 5-7 hours.

Gameplay
Simple and exciting. Clustertruck is a first person game where you have a handful of useful abilities that aid you in your mission of utmost importance, passing through a goal line on the other end of a runway. Consisting of nine worlds, each with ten levels, you must start at Point A and work your way to Point B by leaping from trucks and utilizing abilities like slowing time, double jump, grappling hooks, and a plethora of other odd and nonsensical ways. Despite having superpowers and legs that are likely made of muscular jello, touching the ground or colliding with any object results in immediate death.

Physics are wonderfully exaggerated and controls are easy to work with as you can guide yourself in outlandish directions between or during jumps, while also maintaining a natural balance on lopsided trucks. Propel yourself from the rear of trucks or wall-run alongside them for increased speed. Resourceful superpowered truck jumping man gives Titanfall soldiers and Faith from Mirror’s Edge a run for their money in terms of cat-like reflexes and agility.

Each world offers a different atmosphere, new challenges and hurdles (sometimes literally), and new and exciting ways to mash yourself against a wall, or house, or giant stone cross falling from the stratosphere on the fiery plains of hell. The base game is shorter than I originally expected and once you get the hang of it, most levels can be beaten rather easily.

Clustertruck also offers an Editor Mode that allows you to build your own maps and fine tune inner workings of trucks, objects and physics related aspects.

Sound
Delightful. Clustertruck offers a wonderful soundtrack of upbeat techno tunes that are prevalent through the entire experience and couldn’t be more fitting to the game itself. After playing, download the soundtrack on Spotify so that while you’re inducing panic on I-76 you have something worthwhile to listen to, you reckless freak.

Graphics
On a scale from one to ten, one being a blank screen and ten being polygons, Clustertruck gets a ten out of ten. Really though, aside from shadows, textures, and anti-aliasing there isn’t much to be fiddled with, hopefully that message was clearly relayed through screenshots and videos. It’s emphasis is on gameplay and while the simple graphics, lighting, and visual effects are charming, they aren’t the focus nor should they be.

Replay Value
Missions provide slightly different approaches each restart as trucks don’t always move in a specific pattern, and a decent amount of abilities can offer new forms of playstyle. It’s arguably dependent on the player, if short yet challenging runs and climbing time trial leaderboards are your thing, you may get more hours out of it than most. If you’re like Buzz Lightyear and ‘not aiming for the truck’ is your style of play then I would argue that you’ll find Clustertruck dissatisfying sooner rather than later.

Wrapping Up
Shorter than expected for the price but excusable for the amount of fun it’s gameplay provides. An enjoyable experience that reveals more depth and difficulty as you progress. Clustertruck is a unique interpretation of “the floor is lava” that works with very little to produce a lot of fun.",Recommended,16,1

It's a 3d platformer where you jump on trucks. But saying that is like saying Mario is a game where you jump on goombas.
Where Clustertruck really shines is how the platforming -feels-. Going fast feels great, and little tricks like jumping against the side or back of a truck to gain a huge horizontal/vertical speed boost feels sick to perform. You have plenty of abilities to allow for silly things like yeeting a truck you're on at high speeds, but you can finish each of the levels in the game without them, and blitzing through hard levels by sheer precision platforming alone feels excellent.

The game's content is a little slim - only 110 levels overall, which can easily be played through in a few hours or less if you're good - but what you get there is delightful. From truck cannons to jumping off a cascade of midair trucks to fighting Truck Satan, there's a surprisingly large amount of variety and no gimmick ever felt it overstayed its gimmick.

If you want more content, you can replay levels to aim to cut down your times (if you're the speedrunning sort, I imagine this game would be pretty fun for that) or download fanmade stuff from the workshop (though from the ones I played they don't really stray too much from the maingame levels.)

Also, the soundtrack slaps - a lot of fast-paced rock and techno to get your blood pumping.

Overall, it's a pretty great experience for what you get. Definitely worth it if you're looking for a quick, hype game.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

Truck Trucks Truck Trucked Truck

[Disclaimer: I received a press copy of the game for review purposes, which does not reflect or modify my opinion of the final game.]

Trucks. Trucks. Trucks.

Pros:
Fun, polished platforming that’s simplistic but filled with unique abilities and twists in the level design.
A powerful level-editor that makes for a huge wealth of community levels.









So if you couldn’t tell by that opening, this game involves a lot of trucks. Clustertruck play on the entire gimmick that it’s a first-person platformer where the platforms are unpredictable, moving vehicles that you jump on top off, almost in Megaman X-like fashion. Clustertruck unfortunately takes awhile to prove itself as a game worth the pricetag, but if you’re willing to play beyond it’s campaign with it’s community levels and for chasing it’s time in the leaderboards, you'll find yourself in a experience that constantly changes up what is a simple formula.


The game is simple. Jump from truck to truck to the end of the level. There’s 89 campaign levels, plus a final boss fight. Each World and each level however, constantly shake up the mechanics, with tons of new gimmicks, traps, and more. You can also unlock unique and bizarre abilities, perform crazy stunts, and even play the game as if it was SUPERHOT.


This is the ingenuity of Clustertruck. The developers really know how to take a simple idea, and fully expand it to a project that does full justice to the idea. I found myself easily wanting to replay the levels again and even get to speedrunning it, so that really must say something about how it handles it’s small amount of content. For the most part, I enjoyed all of the levels with the exception of the Final Boss, which at launch was incredibly frustrating and a incredibly sour way to close the game’s set of levels.


In my opinion, Clustertruck suffers from a major design flaw, and that it's a platformer where your platforms are slow, unpredictable vehicles of chaos that will not catch up if you're ahead. It really means that there’s no sense of constant motion and flow, which kind of sucks. If you’re trying to speed ahead, the front car will always either get destroyed or there will be no additional platforms you can use to continue moving. You could build up a crazy combo of airtime but it will usually get interrupted because by then you’re already ahead of the entire pack of trucks.


It’s presentation is simplistic, with a enjoyable soundtrack and a lot of vibrant worlds to play through. The game’s titular trucks don’t change, but the world around it does, which slowly turn the levels from simple, small maps into a completely strange aesthetic covering the entire map. The game is also quite optimized as well, but it really could do without the annoying motion blur that comes with the “Bloom” option. It makes the game incredibly distracting and difficult to play.


If you’re left wanting more levels, you’re going to want to rely on the community for it’s wealth of content. The level editor is almost like fiddling with Unity’s intuitive Scene Builder, and it’s already been the result of fun and unique levels. Hopefully the community will keep at it for months to come, as it's one of the only ways the game will most likely continue with new content.


So overall, Clustertruck is a solid package that can be unappealing to those who are uninterested by the concept. But if you're willing to look past its flaws, it's a solid product that’ll last you a varying amount of platforming fun.",Recommended,16 people found this review helpful 0,3

Clustertruck is a romp filled with nonstop mayhem, where your enjoyment of the game hinges on your ability to tolerate a whole lot of malarkey.

There is no plot to speak of in the game, but the game's central concept isn't hard to grasp. The floor is lava (metaphorically, of course, except for a few times where that's more literal), there are trucks (ergo, the game's name), and you must hop from the top of each truck in an effort to reach an end goal. It's simple, and it's chaos. See, ultimately, Clustertruck is a comedy game of sorts, where the manic scramble for the finish line is rendered into physical comedy by the fact that the trucks, the levels, and at one point the devil himself are all hellbent on stopping you. So, you scramble over trucks and around obstacles and pray, pray that the gods of probability are on your side.

See, tight controls and unlockable moves notwithstanding, there's a core tension at the heart of that's genuinely hard to look past. The game asks for perfection (going as far as to offer a bonus to the player should they beat a level in their first go) while falling back on a physics model that we can generously call ""a bit too inclined towards chaos."" And, of course, that's ignoring the handful of levels to trip you up. All too often, actually completing a level of the game requires foreknowledge of what the level holds, which can lead to what are a lot of deaths and retries. , by virtue of its central premise (physics + trucks + platforming = comedy), is difficult. And there are absolutely times where you have to put the game down out of sheer, agitated frustration.

Is that necessarily a bad thing though? Despite my own inability to beat the final level (which though I'm certain be done, I could not for the life of me tell you ), the game itself is remarkably enjoyable. Though not even remotely fair, it's got an arcade-y flow to it that's pretty engaging, with a slappin' soundtrack to boot. Plus, there's the level editor too, if that's your kinda jam. Make no mistake, is extremely hard, but that's not to say that it's not fun. Honestly, last level notwithstanding, it often feels like being part of an inside joke with the dev team. ""Oh, my god, you're asking me to do what?"" you might ask with a dumb grin as you hop between trucks falling off a cliff into an abyss of lasers. That's the vibe. It's a good vibe. Not a fair or reasonable vibe, but certainly a good time at least.",Recommended,11,0

Leaping from the roof of one truck to another like I’m in a John Woo film as they speed wildly across terrain filled with terrors, traps, and pitfalls is a fantasy I didn’t know that I had. The sheer grandeur and scope of the whole thing is something special in itself, but even when (or if) you get over that, there’s still a pretty entertaining game left, even if it’s forcing you to participate in one of the least intuitive acts of modern gaming – first person platforming.

Trucks gon give it to ya

The first bits of Clustertruck challenge you by forcing you to execute difficult jumps and land on trucks that seem to be getting further apart. This is before you obtain enough of the point currency used to unlock any of the “abilities” like double jumps or slowing down time. That alone can be tough, but it is forgiving enough that it kept me motivated to continue playing. However, I eventually came to gauge my performance by the position that I had achieved on the global leaderboard. Rarely did I break even in to the top 20,000 for any particular level, but it really showed how creative people could get in completing even the simplest levels with such speed. As you progress in the game, you come to find levels that shy away from precision jumping and rely more on the players positioning themselves and having perfect timing to make their way to the goal. Later levels build on this in a logical way by combining both skilled jumping and impeccable timing to make for some unique challenges. The levels are split up in to nine worlds that each have different backgrounds and specific hazards, for instance “Laser World” has obstacles and hazards that predominantly feature lasers that will kill you instantly if touched. The worlds greatly diversify the types of levels you encounter and along with the natural progression of the game leave any given portion of the feeling much different from the rest, even though you will always be bounding across the same white trucks.


It’s apparently possible to complete Clustertruck without using any of the unlocked abilities, there’s even a leaderboard in each level for those that don’t use any, but I can’t imagine how it would be possible for some of them. Abilities like double jump or dash are extremely useful for making long gaps, and time slow or truck freeze can be indispensable when things are falling apart. There’s even the ability to throw down your own truck to land on/jump from. I think they even make the game more fun in many ways. Yet even without these, you can warp back to the start with a simple press of the R key on your keyboard and of course do the same fairly quickly after your inevitable death with the escape button. It works similarly to Super Meat Boy in that regard, except without a little video of all of your horrific deaths played after your success. This keeps the pace of the game up and limits the frustration you feel from some levels that have *especially* difficult designs.


Clustertruck’s difficulty can definitely be an issue and left me raging on some of the tougher levels. The concept of platforming in a first person 3D game is one that has always been notoriously rough and even with the extra maneuverability the character has, I would be mystified by times where I’d miss a landing or “collide” with part of the obstacles. In addition, it often seemed like I had either to execute some difficult tasks with perfection or make it to a point where I had a split second to figure out what to do, but it took me a dozen tries to figure out what was actually necessary. Some levels would take me well under a minute while others had me cycling through for 10 to 15 minutes just trying to figure out the solution and execute it properly. These issues threw a wrench into an otherwise well-paced game. The biggest problem I had was upon reaching the final level. I won’t spoil anything for you, but I can say that it changes up some of the core gameplay and is significantly longer than any other level, which means that those extremely common deaths can have you redoing a large portion of the level far too many times. I understand the need to make a final level stand out, but I found the design to be so disappointing I didn’t actually bother finishing it, which is a rare outcome for me.


At this point, you’re pretty regularly going to see Clustertruck’s $14.99 price discounted under $5 and for that price it’s well worth grabbing. It may not be that long of a game and it does pad the content with seemingly arbitrary difficulty at points, but the experience alone is worth $5. It is always wonderful to have a style of game that stands out from the crowd but is inherently simple in its design. Clustertruck delivers that while also give you an adrenaline rush to boot.

The game's all cool, not too hard, not too easy. I finished the game without ability's in about 3 1/2 hours so the games not too long. There are 90 Levels split up in 9 Worlds plus 10 Halloween themed and 5 christmas themed levels (and an unlimited amount of custom maps). So if you see this game on sale for like 3-5 bucks, grab it, but don't pay full price as I think 15€ is a bit too much for this game.
Important for the achievements hunters out there, it is not possibly to get all achievements for some people (including me). There's an achievement for beating the game without abilities but it doesn't recognize the final level as played without ability, even if you did. I didn't buy any abilitys's, so I can't even use one, but I still didn't get the achievement. I'm not alone with this problem, so it might also affect you.
If you don't care for achievemnts, go for it, it's a nice game",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

This game has been on my wishlist for as far as I can remember, and while I have been keeping an eye out for it I never really felt the need to get the game, until recently when a friend of mine gifted it to me and realized that I should have gotten this game way sooner.

I grew up playing Valve's GoldSrc and Source games, so some of the movement mechanics felt pretty weird to me. Not that it's a bad thing of course, it has its own style and I've grown to very much like it as I've played the game more and more. It's just a small heads up for anyone who might or might not be in the same boat as me before getting the game. Very quickly you'll stop noticing that, and the game will feel very much natural.

As someone who doesn't even like platformers all that much to begin with, I was more than pleasantly surprised to find out how fun this game could actually be! I've only watched some gameplay footage of it, so I didn't expect to see anywhere near the amount of content it really has. You can tell that the luck factor is very much there, but there's still a ton of skill involved and it's a fun journey trying to master all the mechanics it has to offer.

Absolutely can't recommend this game enough, non-stop dopamine rushes guaranteed.",Recommended,13 people found this review helpful 1,0

I trucking love this game.

Its casual, its fun, it has a great soundtrack, and most of all... it is trucking great.
The basis of the game is to get to a certain goal point on the path the trucks are heading. there is many world sets of 10 levels each with their own theme whether it be ice, laser or even medival themed. Each section has there own unique hazards and seems very well put together. There are also abilities and utilities to help you pass levels easier and faster that you unlock with your ingame score. The game is so well put that I find myself taking a harder route to get a faster time and constantly retrying even though I havent even won the level with an easier route. It has me immersed into its toonish feel and gives me a laugh when I randomly hit a truck just right and go flying into the stratosphere.",Recommended,36,3

It's almost as if Mirror's Edge with Euro Truck Simulator had a baby. The premise might be a bit silly at first, but this feels like an epic 1st person representation of the classic game ""The Floor is Lava"".

At first, it may cause some motion sickness, but once you get the hang of it, set to your prefered FOV and you get some practice, the instinct will guide you from truck to truck, testing your skill. With or without using abilities, it feels like a dynamic experience, that once mastered, it gives a plesant feeling of self-worth and acomplishment.",Recommended,20,0

This has been in a lot of bundles and goes for very cheap on sale, particularly at Fanatical. Get it then/there. Otherwise it's the same price as SEUM at full price and is vastly outclassed by that game despite feeling similar. In fact I wish it was more similar because the lack of air control is very frustrating.

For a couple of dollars this is dumb chaotic fun that can be completed in under 5 hours. If you like the idea of speed running levels but wish it was more skill based and less random then check out SEUM.",Recommended,9,0

Clustertruck must be one of the most ridiculous ""flow""-games I have ever played. It somehow reminded me a lot of surf-maps back from the golden Counter-Strike era.

Basically, you jump from truck to truck to reach your goal with completely ridiculous physics, absolutely insane level design and at neckbreaking speeds. It looks kind of boring, but playing this game has a unique kind of flow to it which only very few titles are capable of achieving. There's a solid amount of unlockable special abilities (both passive and active) to make your life easier, but it is also possible to finish the entire game with only basic jumping.

I was more than positively surprised by this and might have ended up playing this way longer than I possibly could have anticipated.

I'm pretty torn on this. When everything aligns just right in the game, and you have a really good run, it is incredibly fun and exhilarating. However I think that the game is missing just a little bit of polish on the jumping/movement mechanics before I would recommend it. There were just far too many times where I felt like I did everything right and had a spectacular run going, and somehow it just completely fails to do what I expected it to - making me smack the back/side of a track and fall down rather than doing a mantle/jump or wall-run - the character just slides off the truck awkwardly - or I feel like I just barely made a jump, but I die instead.


It's unfortunate, because there does seem to be a ton of potential here - my quick play session was a roller coaster of emotions, peaking back and forth between utter joy and complete frustration. In the end, it was just too frustrating, not because of some well designed difficulty, but a complete disconnect in the movement system between what I was attempting and how the physics of the game reacted.",Not Recommended,23,1

Clustertruck is a fast paced action-platformer in which you need to navigate between the rooftops of trucks as chaos unfolds around you.

Pros:
-Really fun, and challenging at the same time. Trying to nail a landing or figuring out where you are as you are launched into the air is both exciting and tricky in this game.
-Simple graphics and the great soundtrack add the fast-paced extreme rush of the game as you jump from roof to roof.
-Main campaign is reasonably short, but there is a lot of community made maps which you can enjoy.
-It has Achievements.

Cons:
-Novelty value of the game dies down pretty quick. Only fun for a few hours at a time.

Overall this is great if you looking for something fun just to pass the time before doing something else. Worth a grab during a sale.

Many of the other negative reviews are spot on. This game has a good concept, but as others have said it is rather short. A friend and I had a lot of fun in the earlier levels. The game felt like deaths were your fault. As the game progressed, not even half way through mind you, A LOT of issue became the norm. Hit detection is abysmal. I consitantly would get fall through the hood of trucks when landing on them from a long fall (which many levels require to complete). You will find yourself having to restart regularly because something off screen ""colllided"" with you. This is made apparent when levels require you to move through very tight obsticles. This is terrible game design as you can not see yourself. You have not clue how big your hitbox is, and it is bigger than the viewport. The physics are also extremely buggy. As others have mentioned the controls will switch between being extremely tight, and being unacceptably loose, often times mid jump, making landing difficult. Jumping is also extremely varied, especially the second jump on a double jump. Sometimes jumps throw you almost straight forward, instead of up, Sometime the second jump is a large increase in height, other times you barley move at all. The way the player interacts with trucks is also buggy at best. The player can move along the side of and the back of the truck. Sometimes this will result in you being thrusted into the ground, perpendicular to your vector of motion. Other times you will rocket up the side of the truck, soaring into the air much much higher than you could ever jump (usually slinging you into a some obstacle). The trucks also seem to randomize their movements. I like this idea because you can replay levels with a different experience. This issue with its currrent implementation is that way too often all of the truck in front of you will simply drive off of the map, or create a blockade that trucks can not pass, making progress impossible. This last point would not be so bad if all of the other issues with the physics engine, collision, and inconsitent player controls also causing deaths. All of these thing create an experience that leaves you thinking, ""Good thing I got lucky, and the game didn't screw me thank time."" Which feels bad to say the least. The first 3 worlds have moments where beating a level feels like a skille victory, but they are also rather easy.

In short, with the only solid feeling levels being worlds 1-3, and the game being riddled with loss causing bugs, bad hit detection, and very inconsitent controls, this game feels pretty bad a lot of the time. It is not worth the price tag until they fix these issues. This is at the end of the day a sloppy platformer. Get it on sale (or donate to the humble bundle to get it) or don't get it at all till the issues are patched.",Not Recommended,45,5

I waited 2 hours for the ""My Little Pony Furry Player Models"" to download for a Serious Military Role playing server. Once I finally got in I was lectured on their rules for another hour, was forced to take an actual test and then finally I got disconnected from the server. After another hour to rejoin I finally got back in and was lectured again and forced to take the test again. After all of that I played on the server for 4 minutes, called one of my fellow new players a little baby. They revealed them self as a hidden admin and banned me for staff disrespect, indefinitely.",Recommended,1526,0

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is",Recommended,"1,198 people found this review helpful

When my friends ask me what my favorite game of all time is they always expect me to say either one of the Witcher games, or Fallout, or any other AAA title, and they are always suprised when they get Garry's mod as the answer. I grew up on this game. Days home from school ""sick"" , rainy weekends, normal afternoons.. I was always here. It was my routine. My comfort. TTT, surf, sandbox, a little prop hunt now and then...

Some of the best moments of my life came from this game. I know, i know. Pathetic right? But i've made some of the most important friendships i've ever had on this game. It was my home for 5 years. and i regret nothing. This game may seem simple and maybe even a little stupid. But that's the point y'know? a simple thing for you and possibly some friends, new or old enjoy. I miss it. I miss the good times. Hopefully this review will make someone buy it, and then they'll learn what i've been talking about. It's an amazing thing.",Recommended,455,29

Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.

""Where do I start?"" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...

_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.

_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.

_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.

_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.

_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.


Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics: 7/10
Story: N/A
Sound: 8/10
Replayability: 10/10

Overall 8.5

Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod

5 reasons to get this game

1. It's not very expensive at only $10, sometimes lower during sales

2. Most of its content is entirely Community-Sourced (great addons like ARC9 Base or gm_backrooms)

3. There are multiplayer servers (if you want multiplayer FPS and RP)

4. The sandbox aspect of it works on so many different levels

5. It's not Overwatch 2",Recommended,356,0

One of the best games I have ever played. I bought it on a whim, years ago, so I could try my hand at building things. That purchase is the best I have made. After 2.5k hours, I can say you will not get bored of this game. Not only do you have the base gamemode of sandbox, allowing you to spawn NPCS, build, and do pretty much anything you want, you also have tons of multiplayer servers and workshop addons to choose from.

Feel like playing a World War 2 Role Playing game? Gmod has a server running it.

Want to be a clone trooper in the Star Wars universe, and earn ranks and combat ability? Gmod has a server running it.

Perhaps you want to play a RTS? Maybe a murder mystery game? Hide and seek? Racing? Yup, Gmod has it all.

Gmod is thousands of games for the price of one, and it is worth it 100%

Trust me, you will NOT get bored of this game.",Recommended,174,4

The game is great.

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lies and deceipt.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",Recommended,189,0

This game got me into PC gaming. I was around 10 years old when I saw people on youtube like Venturiantale and later VanossGaming play this. I watched people play this game for 2 years until finally I got my own laptop and after a while of figuring out how to install steam (and getting a virus in the process) I bought Garry's Mod
with a steam gift card I had asked for that Christmas. My dream had come true. I played sandbox, multiplayer servers, installed a couple mods, etc.
I was hooked for a couple months, sinking hours into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you could do in this game. Every video game I had ever played up to this point had no freedom compared to this game. I would think about all the things I'd do in this game when I got home from school, then spend hours finding something else to do in it, falling into a rabbit hole of creativity in the process.
Slowly over time the feeling died down a bit. Like most source games, this game acted as a gateway into other games on steam. I installed TF2 because of Garry's Mod, and although I wouldn't seriously play tf2 for years after installing it, it became my most played video game of all time. I've been living in a cycle with this game for over 7 years. I'd be completely obsessed with Gmod for a month then for a couple months I'd rarely play. Then I'd be driven back to this game. Back to 500+ mods and no objective.
In my mind, this quality gives this game immortality. The sandbox which relies on people to keep building it further, unhindered by developer updates making mods obsolete or any expectation that the game has for you. This game changes constantly through modding, and the life and death of individual multiplayer servers and gamemodes, but it will never truly change. It wants nothing from you when you boot up the game. It has no qualms about your choices.
There is beauty in a game never changing. So many modern developers and customers want video games to be new and exciting, to such a degree that it becomes absolutely obnoxious. Such is the case with battlepasses and open beta titles which start out great then become so much better through constant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates that nobody even recognizes the title anymore and they refuse to play the game.
Garry's Mod will never change though, it will always be the same experience you had when you played the game 7 years ago. It won't let you down because its different than it was, it expects nothing of you when you return. The only thing that does change the experience is completely optional through the workshop.
I'm very happy to see Garry's Mod getting updates and bug fixes after all these years. It truly warms my heart that undoubtedly the greatest sandbox video game ever made is still being looked after. Just don't change the identity of this game or the innate experience of total freedom that this game provides.

TLDR

If you want a brilliant sandbox which will never let you down despite the state of modern gaming, buy this masterpiece.",Recommended,234,0

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",Recommended,805,0

Garry's Mod is THE sandbox game of Steam. Really, what more can I say? After putting over 400 hours into it, including various gamemodes like TTT, which are incredibly fun when you have people to play with, I decided I'd finally make a review on it.

The Good:
- Absurdly good workshop and ridiculous modding capability. If you can think it, it's probably out there somewhere.
- Runs on just about any machine from 2005 and up. (Heavy mods and large maps can cause frame drops!)
- Likely the best platform for learning LUA coding for games.
- A good time-killer with friends.

The Bad:
- User guides are always filled with spam. Ignore these since they won't have any helpful advice. But really, what advice do we need for this game anymore?
- Loading times get long with lots of mods. You didn't think I'd at least name ONE minor problem, right? Part of the modding charm.

The Ugly:
- None that I can think of since I don't think this game actually has heavy-handed DRMs.

Like I mentioned before, Garry's Mod is the staple sandbox game of Steam. It belongs in anybody's library. It's cheap worth every penny, sale or not, and can provide anyone with literal infinite gameplay.
Thank you, Lord Gaben, for this Source Engine masterpiece. 10 out of 10.

Edit: I mentioned this game's insane moddability. Did I mention this game has mods? I'll mention that this game has a ton of mods.",Recommended,188,3

This review is very short. Garry's Mod is not a game. It is a physics toy and sandbox style tool. In Gmod, you can reluctantly do whatever you want to.

You can: build things such as cars, buildings, bunkers,
airships, boats, or whatever you can think up, use weapons from other valve games, as well as add-on weapons created by other people, play with physics, kill NPCs with literally anything, drive a world of vehicles, paint, destroy stuff, spawn props, spawn ragdolls to pose and beat up, make a machinima for use on Youtube or other video websites, listen to music, and MUCH MUCH more.

There are addons to download, like maps and player models.

The maps can vary from Counter Strike to Team Fortress, Portal to Garry's Mod, and Day Of Defeat to Left 4 Dead. A very addicting toy from Team Garry.",Recommended,241,0

Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming.

If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it.
Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh).

There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers.

A great game with a good community if you know where to look.",Recommended,"4,847 people found this review helpful

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Being a single parent to my daughter—who is now 17—has been difficult for the past two years; whether it's supporting my daughter's cello lessons, or catching up with her usage of the Xbox Game Pass, I've tried. Finding ways to connect with her through hobbies most natural for her age has been a tough journey, for she is always out with friends now, or watching Disney+ in her room.

I let her customize my Steam profile for me—I asked for a goofy theme, and got something else instead, but as long as it makes her happy, so am I—and bought her Garry's Mod to see if I could perhaps play alongside her.

I recall all sorts of fun modes such as Prop Hunt back in my college days, groups of friends and online folks playing in-between study sessions. The highlights of those memories, those bits of enthusiasm, now I can share them with my Sarah. For the first time in the past five years, I was able to teach her a thing or two about a game! Come to think of it, this is the happiest I have ever seen her while being 'Player 2' for a change.

After spending countless hours playing this in the past, now I can make it easier for Sarah while she takes her Steam Deck whenever we go out camping at our local lake. If her mother hadn't passed away due to C-19, I know she would be here with us, proud to see our beloved daughter spend some time as an extroverted adolescent. Now Sarah's all into crazy mods and physics videos! Thank you for bringing new, geeky moments for me to share with my little girl!",Recommended,621,0

2,000 Hours don't come out of a watch. It comes out of your life. Was the 2k hours worth it? Yes indeed. For a game like Gmod to be amazing for such a low price your wondering is it good or bad? Its both 100% depending on the gamemode you play. Do i suggest it? I don't know does time come out of a watch?

+Rep


1,000 Hours later still finding the game interesting, I've met wonderful people, bad people, and the ones to love and adore. From my 3k Hours this game is top Notch. Not Notch as in minecraft but, yeah. TOP NOTCH

-

2021 Update ~ How to explain my 4,000 Hours so Far.

There's 104 days of summer vacation
And school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it Like maybe...

Joining Deathrun
Or fighting a 12 year old
Or climbing up the TTT Leaderboards
Or giving a zombie a bashing

Surfing on servers
Creating NPCS
Or locating kleiner's brain (It's over here! )Finding a good server
Changing materials
Or driving your friends insane (Gary! )As you can see
There's a whole lot of stuff to do
Before school starts this fall (Come on Freeman)

So stick with us 'cause Garry's Mod
Are gonna do it all
So stick with us 'cause Garry's Mod are
Gonna do it all!
(Breen! Freeman and Kleiner are making a title sequence! )
(Guitar downs)

This concludes my review on Garry's Mod. +1

2022 Update ~ 4,700 hours later. (Only an increase of 700 the past year)

- Still one of my favorite games to come back to, always helps pass the time. Playing all the gamemodes it brings. Saddest things I've noticed is the slow decline of players, servers, and communities. But the Gmod experience still stays strong. Definitely still recommend over the years.

2024 Update ~ 4,876 hours later. (Only an increase of 176 the past 2 years)

I teach high school physics. I feel this activity would be incredibly good for my students and will be recommending it to all of them in class tomorrow. The way the ""Physics"" (HA!) gun moves stuff around allows me to teach average velocity/ acceleration due to gravity as things are dropped on the map. Well worth the money out of my teaching budget. Highly recommend for all teachers who don't believe in teaching through the textbook. That's right. The building exceeds wind speed!

Still the best game that is supported by developers and does not let you get bored.
- A lot of servers with various options to spend time.
- A lot of mods with which you can have a great time in the sandbox.

Garry's Mod
Is not a game. It is a physics toy and sandbox style tool.
In Gmod, you can reluctantly do whatever you want to. You can: build things such as:
cars, buildings, bunkers, airships , boats , or whatever you can think up.
*Use weapons from other valve games, as well as add-on weapons created by other people.
Play with physics, kill NPCs with literally anything, drive a world of vehicles, paint, destroy stuff, spawn props, spawn ragdolls to pose and beat up, make a machinima for use on YouTube or other video websites, listen to music, and MUCH MUCH more.
There are addons to download, like maps and player models.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀A very addicting toy from Team Garry!

Garrys Mod

The most enjoyable and mod filled game on steam, Garrys Mod. Garrys Mod is an amazing game with a good amount of gamemodes and lovely servers. You may want to play Sandbox and smack around batman or play TTT and rage because you were rdmed.

Gameplay


Garrys mod does not have a specific type of gameplay ranging from Prop Hunt to Stop It Slender. However your gameplay can be significantly improved by using the steam workshop and adding items.

Mods

Garrys mod is a game focused upon the premise of random and fun addons. I personally enjoy being a watermelon and firing pizzas from a bazooka. Garrys mod has an amazing amount of mods including characters and items. This is a game focused around its modding community.


TTT is the most famous gamemode in Garrys Mod. The premise of the game is simple. At the begining you are assigned a role, you are either an innocent bystander, a detective, or a traitor. However do not worry if you are innocent for this is trouble in terrorist town meaning everybody had guns. The innocent and the detectives try to find out who the traitors are while the traitors try to kill them all off. The gamemode is fun and server usually will have cool player models or gun. The main downside with TTT is rdmer's. RDM stand for Random Death Match and an rdmer is someone who out of the blue will try to kill you. This means an inno/detective randomly kills an inno/detective or a traitor kills an traitor or an inno just randomly kills someone who is a T. This really spoil's the gamemode making it unenjoyable at times but usually admins or mods will be on to help you or they will have an option to directly report it to kick/ban the person.


Sandbox is where creativity and stupidity flourish. Sandbox is where you can get all your downloaded mods and just have fun. Sandbox is just fooling around and having fun. It is one of Garrys Mod most hilarious game modes (if you play with the right people).


So if your planning on playing Sandbox I would recommend playing singleplayer or creating a hamachi or another program to play with a select group of friends,

If you plan to play other gamemodes I suggest playing multiplayer and trying to find a nice server which you can enjoy.



+ fun alone or with friends
+ many gamemodes to enjoy
+ massive amount of creative and fun mods
+ overall great community
+ highly enjoyable


- rdmers
- will end up overloading computer with mods


Garrys Mod is a must buy with its countless possibilities. It may take you a while to find a nice server or the gamemode that is for you but when you find it good times will be waiting. The mods are just so amazing that I salute all the mod makers for their effort and allowing me to become a watermelon with a portal gun.",Recommended,168,0

Played over 1000 hours of GMOD and recommended it to anyone who is looking to role play or have a laugh as it provides a great variety of different servers in the community be very aware with it hosting servers you will find a lot of toxic players and 18+ content so if it's for a younger player I would not recommend at all. In terms of performance I feel it lacks a lot but that the kind of design they are going for (simple) and easy.

The sky is the limit, quite literally.

There are so many things you can do in this game, it makes some AAA games look small. When you buy Garry's Mod, you are really paying $10 for a blank canvas. It's up to you to find out what you want to do with it. You can mess around in the sandbox, making cities, waging wars, doing heists with friends, really there is no limit. If you don't like to use the sandbox mode, no worries. This canvas you bought can do so many other things. How about you play a game where you and many others work together to try to kill a small group of Traitors who are also trying to kill you? How about a game where you disguise as props and play a big game of hide and seek? Theres way more than just that, but I hope you get my point. Valve has given us this canvas where you can do whatever you want. The Steam workshop is your portal to all of the things you can get to shape your canvas and make your game how you want it to be. There really isn't much describing you can do with this game, because you, the player, make it what it is.",Recommended,144,0

At first, I was going to make a review about garry's mod, and why I've found it unfun recently. But then I had a revalation. A eureka moment, of sorts. At first, I joined a MilitaryRp server, waited 10 minutes to be trained, then left.

It wasn't fun.

I got bored so I decided to join and troll a dark ""rp"" server (heavy quotes on rp) just to laugh at all the bad servers. I joined, picked the dog job the server had, walked up behind someone, and said as loudly as I could ""OMAE WA MO SHINDERU"" and started attacking him. This turned into 10 minutes of role-playing as a edgy anime character, ending with a final duel between me and the guy I tried to kill. He pulled out his ultimate werewolf form and defeated me.


It was fun.

This is what made me realize what garry's mod is, and why it's fun. Garry's mod isn't really a serious game. It's not meant to be taken seriously. I mean, look at the store pictures for it. Doesn't it just shout ""serious military roleplay""? When you take garry's mod, and try to bring seriousness to it, it's hard. Take the MilitaryRp server, for example. Why did I even need to be trained? I've played those servers before, and they ALL make you go through training. All they teach you are meaningless boring stuff, like ranks, faces, and other things that you probably never use.

When you try to make this game a slog of rules, it just ruins it.

This game shines when silly stuff happens, and is encouraged. You can do some weird stuff too.

Try it.

See what weird stuff you can come up with.

Never be serious.",Recommended,208,9

Garry's Mod is total, absolute freedom. You can make it a war game, a horror game, or a racing game. You can run from a png of Obunga, or you can make a silly bathtub car. There is almost NOTHING you can't do. The game rarely needs updates, because the community updates the game itself. Absolutely would recommend it.

From Olympus, to Lazarus, and Tamewater. Providing me friendships I wasn't able to enjoy after school by strict and afraid parents, up to the end of when I'm in college now. There were so many of them, all of us with bad computers and not enough money to either get the top games or the parts needed for them. We started as kids and teens with an idea and the game of imagination, and after seven years, I only regret that we got tired of it. Even me. Here's to Garry's Mod; the game isn't holding up anymore these days, many players are leaving for better games or college; reached about as high as it can go... But damn did it reach high. Thank you Gmod, and all the friends I made. It was so fun, and if I could go back, I'd take that trip again.",Recommended,149,13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Don't get me wrong, this game is amazing, but I think game modes would make the game even better. A Noob Mode could have two fathers. A Pro Mode could have two babies, one waking up shortly after the other. There are locked doors around the house, so I figure there will be new rooms pretty soon. Maybe a Bedtime Mode, where you have to get the baby back to bed without waking the mom. The possibilties for this game are endless and I really hope to see this game do well.

NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS OF THE EARLY ACCESS VERSION AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS VERSIONS ARE RELEASED.

(Written as of....Alpha V0.3.0. Can't wait for the update this friday!)

The game right now is fun but has issues. The gameplay is rather simple. One player is a baby who must die before time runs out (I think it's 4 minutes.) while the dad must keep him safe.

Now while the gameplay has evolved over the versions (Pills used to heal baby too and were infinite.) the game has some serious balance issues. I was able to play for about an hour as baby (I'd leave and make a new lobby each time so I'm always baby.) and was able to win every time, often before the first 30 seconds. Forks spawn near the crib and you can easily jump up, grab it, and use it on an outlet to die instantanously. If a hammer is on the TV stand you can smash the coffee table and eat the glass to die quick too.

Daddy gameplay is fun too but it seems very easy to shut baby away from harm if you know where to look. (Put knives and forks on sofa, etc.)

The main ways to die as Baby are either electrocution by outlet or poisoning (Glass works the fastest.) drowning or cooking yourself in the oven takes too long and can be easily stopped by Daddy, which should be made faster.

The game also has technical flaws. Often the countdown before a match starts glitches and I have to alt F4, but it's rare. (I get it often enough I'll complain on the review though.)

The house has alot of rooms locked (WIP stuff not added yet.) so I can't say for the finished state yet. It might be more balanced and fair if more rooms are involved (there's literally no reason to go upstairs currently. Nothing dangerous spawns up there aside from power outlets you can use to zap yourself, and there's no falling damage. There is a funny dildo hidden in the bedroom though.) but it's hard to say. I know the next update adds ventilation shafts and more chores Daddy can do.

Speaking of the chores, they're not easy. Putting all toys away takes a good deal of time and by the time you're distracted doing that Baby often offs himself. Finding the smoke detector battery is iffy. Sometimes I swear it doesn't spawn at all, which might be a glitch. (Or maybe I'm not looking hard enough.) The next update adds more chores and daddy powers. Doing the chores gives you daddy powers like being able to see Baby through walls or see objects through walls, or be invisible to baby.

Now for the main question, is it worth the 5 dollars? Honestly, yes. The game has serious potential to be amazing with more features which are coming soon.


EDIT: It's been a long time since I came back, but here I am! This section was written after the outside update was released.

The game was expanded. Baby's crib was moved to the bedroom, then it was moved to the baby's room which was previously locked upstairs.

New rooms include a garage where you can blow yourself up with a car or set yourself on fire with gasoline, an office room upstairs, a shower upstairs with chemicals for baby to drink or burn in the shower, a laundry room with a washer and dryer for baby to die in, and an outside area with a pool.

They added weapons for the baby and daddy like a taser or a ball blaster, etc. You can now drop the toaster in water and get electrocuted, or blow up a fork in the microwave. New chores include cooking for the baby, washing him, etc.

Family Gathering mode was added, which allows 8 players. You now have achievements and can get hats for doing them.


However, the game is now out of early access. They added music which many people have complained about, but I actually like the music just fine.

I have one major issue. The game wasn't ready for release yet! With the newest update, the game is broken! After Baby kills himself, the game doesn't seem to recognize it. You're forced to spectate until time runs out, and Daddy basically wins by default after time runs out.

Also, some achievements are broken. I swear I've spent an entire match just playing with the piano and the achievement didn't pop.

Is the game still worth the money? Maybe. But the developer needs to get his act together and fix these bugs! How did this pass playtesting? The ""Game doesn't recognize Baby dying."" bug literally happens every time, and it breaks the game! it's been a few days (At least 3) and the developer didn't release a hotfix or anything!

It shouldn't have left early access yet.

Buy it if you want, but keep in mind in it's current state it still feels early access, and has game breaking bugs.",Recommended,70,2

My friend convinced me to buy this game, and I must say I was not disappointed. My friend thought he was so clever, hiding all the knives and forks, and putting the bleach on the shelf. Soon he believed he had won, but he didn't sweep the kitchen thoroughly enough. I jumped inside the oven and cooked myself alive. Fantastic.",Recommended,221,0

This game is fantastic. Now whenever my girlfriend wants to talk about starting a family I make her play this with me first and show her just how easy it is for a baby to cover themselves in gasoline and then incinerate themselves using a poorly placed candle. That usually buys a me a couple of weeks.

The game still needs some work, but is a lot of fun. Really looking forward to seeing where this goes.",Recommended,296,0

Several reasons why you should NOT buy this game

1 - Movement and controls are buggy/clunky
Trying to pick things up and manipulate your environment is very difficult. Items may drop out of your hands, slide around, or phase through surfaces. In a game that relies on your ability to pay attention and act quickly (especially for the dad players) it really hurts the game's playability.

2 - The game is heavily sided towards the baby
Some may say this point is subjective, but it's hard to prove otherwise.
*The baby has TONS of options to kill itself with. A baby can so very easily consume a toxic material (which the house is absolutely LITTERED with), burn itself, drown itself, and much much more!!!
*Sounds fun until you play as the dad, who can only lock cabinets, cover up outlets, and attempt to put toxic materials out of reach (which is downright impossible considering how many bottles of bleach, soap, and batteries are in every cabinet of the house).

3 - The game is DEAD
Even if the game was balanced and played well (which the other points prove it absolutely does not) There are no players playing this game. The makers of the game decided to create a bunch of weird game modes that sounded fun, but only split up the online lobbies further. Nowadays it'll probably take you roughly 30 minutes of waiting in matchmaking (don't even think about queuing up for baby, because everyone prefers it over the dad) or if you're lucky there's some random person who is sitting in an open online lobby.

Final verdict: Stay away from this game. It may seem inexpensive and funny, but I guarantee you'll get bored with it extremely fast. Don't waste your money.",Not Recommended,295,18

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Who's your daddy is a really fun idea for a game.
YouTube™ Video: Who's Your Daddy Let's Play (Early Access) [Part 1] - ""Mommy's Toy"" 
Views: 1,805
Genna and Simi play a game about a suicidal baby and its irresponsible dad. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...

Although there are a few strange-looking animations and limited exploration in the current early access build, this is pretty promising. I've never found any glitches, and the main mechanics for the game are already in place and hilarious.

The game is simple, one player is a suicidal baby, trying to find any means of ending its life. Where the other player is the panic-stricken dad trying to keep the baby safe until mum comes home.
Every time a round starts, object locations are randomized, allowing for some pretty good replay value. The baby can end its existence in a multitude of ways. E.g: Stick a fork in an outlet, drown itself in the sink or cook itself in the oven.
As the dad, you have the ability to take objects out of the baby's hands directly and put them on higher up counters out of its reach. You may also lock certain cabinets if you find a padlock, or turn off faucets.

At the moment, the game is relatively well balanced, although I feel like the dad might be a bit overpowered if the player chooses to follow the baby constantly.
Right now, you can complete a chore by throwing all of the baby's toys into the toybox, and then obtain a random powerup like the ability to see items through walls or be invisible to the baby.
This chore is completely optional though.
I feel like the chore(s) should be mandatory, so they must be complete as well as the baby survive until mum comes home. It might sound a bit tough for the Dad, but it's the only method I can think of to prevent the dad from just preying on the baby constantly. Besides, he can force pull objects out of the baby's hand. Perhaps the baby could respawn in a random spot instead? Those are just a few suggestions.

Overall, I can't wait until more death opportunities arrive, and more house rooms are created. It's a really funny base for a game, and genuinely well executed. (Perhaps also a game mode where the baby needs to run away from the dad, because it can be picked up and thrown into the toilet or oven?) Did I say that out loud?

Who's your Daddy: An Update History

I used to be able to say ""Yeah, I can recommend this game, it's fun and can be made into a meme. The community is nice and the game is fun. The house isn't finished yet but in a few updates I'm sure it'll get better"" and it did. More rooms got added, more ways for the baby to die and more ways for the dad to counter these new tactics.

But with time, comes decay. Youtubers hyped up this game and their viewers flocked to the game to play it and do what their favorite youtubers did. Then the youtubers left to play other games, then the followers ditched the game to follow like sheep. The developers tried their best to keep the users. They added a new soundtrack, but the radio in game played music as well. That made some people begin to leave, the devs didn't want this, so they added more.

They added the pool, which was a faster way to die the bathtub way. So the bathtub method was useless, the pool was quieter and didn't require setups, the baby could get under the car and prevent the dad from getting to him. So the devs made it so the dad could crawl, this made the dad clip through walls. Players wanted to pick the baby up, so the devs added the baby grabber claw, but players didn't like that it could break, so the devs made it so the dad could pick up the baby when they had depleted stamina. This broke for babies who were always sprinting.

By this time, the Youtubers left, and so did 80% of the playerbase. But the newly named ""Evil Tortilla Games"" company was not ready to give up yet, so they added a baby car and pool cover. There was already a pool counter but the devs didn't seem to care. They just added new gamemodes, some of which are broken. But those are for another review to cover. They added hats at some time, but some of them didn't unlock, others did, but the players didn't get the steam achievement.

As one final resort, ""Evil Tortilla Games"" implimented single player challenges, but this wasn't what the players who asked for singleplayer wanted. Some wanted a version where the dad was an AI or the baby was an AI. But in the challenge ""Race Dad to the Bedroom"" The dad doesn't even move, and in the dad mssion ""Get all the babies out of the Pool"" the babies are constantly moving. These actions did not please players...

Now we're at today, October 30th, 2017. The developers recently released an update that upset players. Bug fixes? Optimization? Nope, Just a ""new"" halloween map. People are still talking about fixing the game in the comments. Evil Tortilla Games has given up on this game, If you haven't noticed they released ""Zooicide"" their new ""Meme"" game. Youtubers have played it already. It seems like that game is losing it's charm already, heh. How the cycle continues.",Not Recommended,88,4

A creative idea and hilarious the first few times; however the game gets insanely boring as the baby tends to win every game unless they don't know what they're doing. The dad has little to no prep time to child proof anything. It becomes hectic as the child has nearly infinite ways to kill themselves, leaving the father almost powerless.",Not Recommended,61,3

When I was a baby i had a serious addiction to consuming every single chemical I could find, but one day my father found me drinking the Windex window cleaner and got very mad. In his anger he picked me up and threw me into the oven, being a baby at the time I couldn't fight back. I could only sit there and whine as he furiously took me out of the oven and slammed my already indented skull (My parents used my head as a ash tray) into the marble counter top and then threw me outside into the pool. I almost died in that pool until my mother got home and proceeded to beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of my father until he died and then saved me, I lost all my memory after that so I still wonder who's my daddy?",Recommended,54,1
5130,90,Who's Your Daddy?!,"Posted: May 14, 2016
I'd have to say, if you're interested in this, do not buy it, at least not now.

Bought it a while ago for my son and I to play, after he was watching a let's play of it. Seemed like a goofy game to mess around with.
It is, actually.
For maybe a round or two.
When we first got it, it had issues, but hey, it's early access, right? Well, as each update came out, it seemed like there were more and more issues. Weird lag, objects not working, getting stuck, random people joining our password protected custom game, etc.
Then, out of nowhere, it's 'released'. I'm sorry, but this game is NOT ready for release.
Not sure where to begin.
How about performance? Pretty abysmal. Can be running smooth, but then the framerate just plummets, mouse movement is all jerky, and it just feels rough.
Graphics-Quite poor. I'm not one to judge a game by it's graphics by any means, but overall, the game just looks bad. Looks like the devs just slapped it together and called it good. Character models are atrocious (hats and glasses are humorous though), textures are all over the place. Some look fine, but others don't make any sense. Go outside and look at the achievement room. The room is flat, but the 'bricks' taper off. Good example of it being slapped together.
Controls-Serviceable I suppose, although picking up items and using them is a major chore.
Balance-absolutely ridiculous. It's not a matter of who is going to win? The baby or the daddy? It's a matter of if the baby dies in one minute or two. The daddy has only a couple things he can do to stave off the baby's death, but there are sooo many options for the baby to off itself, it quickly turns into a race to see just how fast the baby can kill itself, especially with warping through vents.
Idea/concept-brilliant. Actually a really good idea for a game, but there are so many issues right now, I'd stay away. We'll probably keep playing it off and on for a while to see if things improve, but it's quickly becoming tiresome.

2. 1 cup half-and-half or milk
3. 4 eggs, slightly beaten
4. 1/4 teaspoon salt
5. 1/4 teaspoon pepper
6. 8 slices bacon, crisply cooked crumbled(3/4 cup).. make more you heathens
7. 1 cup shredded Swiss or Cheddar cheese 4 oz
1/4 cup grated Parmesan Cheese
8. Tablespoon chopped shallots, if desired

Directions:

1. Heat oven to 350°F. Place pie crust in 9-inch glass pie plate as directed on box for One-Crust Filled Pie.
2. In medium bowl, mix half-and-half, eggs, salt and pepper; set aside. Layer bacon, cheeses and onion in crust-lined plate. Pour egg mixture over top.
3. Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes; cut into wedges.

*************** TIPS ****************

1. One frozen Pillsbury™ Deep Dish Pie Crust may be substituted for the refrigerated Pie Crust in this recipe. Place cookie sheet on oven rack. Heat oven as directed. Prepare filling and follow directions on package for One-Crust Filled Pie.

2. Sprinkle chopped green onion on top of baked quiche for a pop of color and flavor.

3. Air fry that bacon for optimal crisps.

4. Use a wire whisk to beat the half-and-half with the eggs, after seasoning them. A whisk is the most efficient way to really blend them together, creating a custard mixture that will meld well with the rest of the ingredients.",Recommended,118,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
-Quick Review-
Who's Your Daddy is genre I'd like people to start using called ""Creepy Simulator"", on par with the games: ""What's under your blanket !?"" and ""Shower With Your Dad"".
If we're speaking specifically, it's a competitive, co-op game between a baby and father, the person controlling the baby is trying to kill himself or herself, while the father frantically runs around trying to keep the baby from death's grip.

-Detailed breakdown review-
Story There's not much to say about the game's story, however *I* have a number of stories from playing the game. I purchased this game to play it with my younger brother, and then laughed until I cried at all the hilarious events that took place.
To all of my friends who sent me messages saying ""oh god, that game""; instead of judging me from afar, you should have joined my twitch stream and laughed along with me .
From setting myself on fire as a baby, predicting what my brother was going to do, and hearing his frustrated screams of ""don't give me those pills! Keep that apple away from me!"", it really was a hilarious stream.

I'm not going to spoiler tag my whole review, but lets say this game is way more fun when you don't know very much about the mechanics of the game. Grab two copies of this game, grab a friend, skype, and enjoy. Read on if you don't mind having basic gameplay spoiled.

I have already explained the gist of the game. If you're the father: you try to keep your child alive by moving dangerous objects away, and giving pills and fruit to your child to keep them healthy until mom gets home! As the baby your objective is to get yourself killed in one of the very many MANY ways of doing so, drowning, freezing, burning, poison, power outlets, and more that are still being added (03/07/16) as the game updates.

Some may criticize the game on it's graphics, or glitches that may happen while playing. Naturally in most games this would be a negative quality, but there's a hilarious novelty about the game, and it's not over priced for the entertainment.

There are no steam achievements at this time. This is a game which would be fun to have ""dumb achievements"", just so achievers can grab an easy 100%, since the game at this time is purely 1v1 co-op, an achievement for each death would be very easy to teach people the various ways you can die, or power ups you can unlock as the father.

Who's Your Daddy is priced at $4.99, now I normally grade games by 1 dollar for every hour played, but for this game I make an exception. The quality of laughter and company of my brother over ruled the standard rule.
At this time I've spent two and a half hours playing the game. I have no doubt as the game is updated we will continue to play it occasionally, so even in price and hour the game will probably make it!

There's not much else to say about the game, the developer has already made a great game, and we can all look forward to seeing what other madness will be added to the game, and hopefully the developers don't get picked up by child support services before the game comes out of Early Access.
I recommend this game for anyone to play with another friend (if you have a funny friend, it's even better), if you're generally a solo gamer this is a skip for you.",Recommended,132,16

I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Recommended,279,0

This game is probably one of my favourite original concepts. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ genius, and on so many levels makes this game incredibly fun. If you have $4.99 and a friend to play with, pick it up!

Wishes:
- Take some time to update characters
- More houses or areas (hopsital, daycare, ect)

Pros:
- Can kill self/baby
- Extremely fun for all players
- Cool game modes
- Runs on any computer with it's insane graphic settings

Cons:
- Characters don't look that great. Their animations are really bad, and I hope their improved upon.
- Lags when you're outside even with a decent computer. (GTX 960 2GB, 12 GB DDR3, i5-4460)",Recommended,47,1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
At a glance, Who's Your Daddy might look like just another one of those garbage games that somehow passed through greenlight - but unlike most of those games, Who's Your Daddy is actually surprisingly fun. The game's concept is fairly simple, in which one player plays as a baby and tries to kill themself using a variety of household objects, while the other player controls a dad trying to protect the baby, providing a shockingly realistic portrayal of actual parenthood. There are a variety of ways for the baby to kill themself, like eating batteries or dropping a toaster in the sink, giving the game replayability by challenging yourself to kill yourself in creative ways. The dad gets various objects to try to protect the baby, like a tool to lock drawers and a baby grabbing handle to temporarily pick up the baby, and can also do chores around the house to get powerups like Dad Bod, which allows you to carry heavier things. The game is only in alpha right now, but the developer seems to be fairly diligent in adding regular updates that add new features and ways to die, and at five dollars per copy I think it's a pretty good game to get together with a friend and have a few hours of laughter.",Recommended,42,1

I mean it's okay I guess.

With friends it's pretty alright for a quick laugh, but nothing else. It's one of those quick meme games youtubers get people to buy and then never play again after an hour. If you have friends with this game, it'll be another dead game in your library after a few hours. If you have no friends with this game, don't bother. It's not as fun with some random player.

Examples of games like this that youtubers get people to buy:
*Life of Bread (edit: i am bread)
*Goat Simulator
*FNAF

edit: still not sure if i should recommend this or not. the price is very fair, i just feel like this should be a gmod gamemode or something..

What started out as a joke on Funnyjunk.com from a despised, sad cat man, turned into the family friendly game of the year. ""Who's Your Daddy"" is the sleeper hit of 2015, the brain child of Thehumanidiot, turning decades of volunteer dad work into a full hands on simulated experience.

The goal of 'Who's your daddy' is to make sure that your spawnling doesn't remove himself from the gene pool too quickly (High School is the most appropriate time for this.) You do this by making sure that the baby can't eat dozens of batteries, stick forks into electrical sockets, and drinking blue juice under the sink. Alternatively, if you are playing as the baby character, it's your job to be as much of a little ♥♥♥♥ as humanly possible. This is more choice than a Telltale video game.

The graphics are nothing to write home about. The dad is a heteronormative cis white male, with the baby able to change its appearance based on what actions it has undertaken. It's possible to turn the baby into Shrek if you eat too much blue juice, for example.

The soundtrack consists of one song that constantly loops. It is actually the newest hit single by young money rapper Drake, where he dances like a complete bozo on film. The song plays in the main menu, and from the in game radio, a statement of how every single song on the radio is exactly the same. Not only are we treated to a parent trainer, we also have a strong message about the media today.

All in all, 'Who's your Daddy' is an ideal game for anyone that wants to have a nice friendly game. The price is cheap, the graphics inducing nostalgia, and the gameplay is simple yet effective. I fully anticipate when we're treated with 'Who's your Daddy' at EVO 2016.",Recommended,250,21

Hilarious, always full of laughs finding enw ways to kill yourself as a baby. The online is solid but the players are sketchy.

the good:
lots of ways to kill yourself, just about anything makes you trip balls, all psychodelic!
solid multiplayer
dad can get buffs by doing chores
the stun gun and foam guns are fun!

the bad:
the building is not anatomically(proportionally) correct as you can see by glitching through the ceilling in the laundry room that the floors overlap from the main to second floor with no room for a floor system. if the devs need consultation im a carpenter adn electrician.
the ventilation is basic means of one way travelling though it should lead back to the furnace.

it is too easy as a baby to kill yourself than it is for a dad to stop you(definite balance needed). they need to make the dad faster or give him time to set up or complete a chore.

in multiplayer the more people play the more dangerous items appear, where the hell did all the knives come from?

I recommend this game, but it has its flaws. The videos on this game are more fun then actually playing it. I feel that being the dad is too hard, because the baby is versatile and can move like tiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flash, and that the baby is too easy for the previous reason. This is still an Early Access game, so if you don't like it please don't return it because I'm sure alot of the unbalancing features will be fixed in future updates.",Recommended,42,0

You know, this game is hilarious when it works - but it rarely does.

Controls are finicky (which is a huge problem as the daddy!) but are probably passable.

Incredibly easy to win as baby -- EXCEPT the win condition is bugged and only maybe one out of 10 wins as baby actually ends the game. Most of the time you are stuck waiting on the timer to say daddy wins.

You probably need 2+ parents just to win against a single baby if that baby is competent (which is a strange sentence to be typing, believe you me).

No access to menus of any sort in-game, incredibly limited information for daddy regarding baby unless you follow it like a hawk.

I CANNOT recommend this game in its current form, unless you don't mind a very experimental and incredibly unbalanced release. Not to mention the fact that it rarely works properly.

My hope is that the dev continues to be responsive and polishes this up - it has potential!",Not Recommended,83,2

""Who's Your Daddy"" is not just a game; it's a transformative experience that played a pivotal role in securing custody of my 8-year-old son during a tumultuous divorce. This seemingly whimsical game became the unexpected key to mending our relationship and, ultimately, influencing my son's choice to stay with me.

The game's premise, where one player takes on the role of a vigilant dad and the other a mischievous baby, provided a unique platform for us to reconnect. As we navigated through the virtual household, laughter and communication flowed freely, breaking down barriers that had built up during the divorce process. The cooperative nature of the game acted as a conduit for us to rebuild trust and understanding.

Our in-game adventures spilled over into real life, as ""Who's Your Daddy"" became a symbol of our shared experiences. The lessons learned in the game—teamwork, communication, and a healthy dose of humor—began shaping our interactions beyond the digital realm.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
In the beginning there was Baby. Before Baby there was nothing. Baby created all that is real and alive. On the first day Baby created Bleach, the drink of kings. Baby saw what he made and it was good. On the second day Baby made Batteries, with these batteries Baby could power his army of robot-powered soldiers. On the third day, Baby made forks. Baby used the forks to electrify his inner soul, causing a reaction so fierce he could wipe all life off the face of the planet. Baby saw the forks, and they were good.

On the fourth and final day (Because Baby cannot count), Baby created Daddy. A slave for Baby, so that he could sit back and relax whilst Daddy did all the work. However Daddy became sentient, and enslaved Baby instead. Locking him away in the nightmarish chamber known as 'The Crib'. It is now time for Baby to strike back, use his own creations against Daddy; and enslave the world.

This is Baby's time. This is your time.",Recommended,885,20

okay guys this is a buggy game, but for me, someone who plays it with a friend, very much enjoys it, I wouldn't play it with stranger alone, and I wouldn't play to try very hard to win, that isn't the point of the game, it is a party game with friends to literally joke around and half fun, not try really hard to win, this game has mixed reviews for some good reasons, buggyness and bias towards certain outcomes, but as a game that is funny and meant to be a good time, for the price it is great, the bugs actually kinda add to the game for me, if you don't play on having a friend play it with you, it probably isn't worth it, if you do it is a great buy!",Recommended,22,0

At a first glance I thought I would hate Human Fall Flat.
“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought.
...
After playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it.






I was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all.
Human Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours.",Recommended,98,0

Human Fall Flat is a game that is supposed to be fun and entertaining, especially when played with friends. However, for me, it just reminded me of how lonely and isolated I am.

I don't have any friends to play this game with, and so I ended up playing it alone. It was just a reminder of how much I miss having someone to laugh and have fun with.

The game itself is okay, but it's not something that can make up for the lack of human connection in my life. I found myself getting frustrated and depressed as I played, feeling like I was just going through the motions and not really enjoying it.

In short, Human Fall Flat is a game that is best played with friends. Unfortunately, I don't have any, and so it just ended up being a sad and depressing experience for me.

This game is pure comedic gold! 😂 The physics are hilariously wonky, and I've lost count of how many times I've faceplanted while trying to navigate my wobbly character. It's even funnier with friends - ""grab my butt"" has become a common phrase during our gaming sessions.

While the base game's level selection is a tad short, the Steam Workshop is a lifesaver! There's a ton of creative, player-made content out there that adds hours of replayability.

Human: Fall Flat is a great game to pick up on sale. Play it single player, online, or invite a friend over and play split screen. The simple controls paired with a poorly responsive blob of a character mean you both shall be learning at the same pace. Mess around in the playgrounds they've given you, get achievements, or advance through the levels. Simultaneously complete tasks, do stuff separately, or help each other. Do what you want in what order you like.

Not worth the full asking price of £11.99 (just my opinion), but for 50% off at somewhere around the £6 range this game had me laughing, thinking, and cooperating with someone close to me and for that it gets my approval.",Recommended,116,1

If you're up for hours of finger-cramping and sweaty hands (keyboard and mouse gameplay), this is a really great game to struggle through with friends or even strangers. The story levels/dream levels are extremely fun to play and I absolutely love how some of the achievements for the game are out of the way and some may be time-consuming. In addition to the dream levels, there are hundreds of workshop maps that will cater to your liking; parkour maps, puzzle maps (i.e. mazes, riddles, sudoku, puzzles, etc.), hide and seek maps, battle arenas (i.e. sword or lightsaber fighting), bunnyhopping maps, etc. Although, I do have to say that finding a really good map after playing all the most popular ones of all time is a bit like finding a needle in a haystack, but it's worth it.

The levels are meant for you to get from spawn to the exit and there are a couple of tutorial tools IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME to help you (dream level called ""Mansion"" and ""Mountain""), so all those reviews about not knowing what to do in game, did not pay attention to the voice overs or the helpful hints.

If you play a lot of the workshop maps and can handle the language barrier, I do recommend downloading the Google Translate app on your phone to translate the foreign maps (mainly Chinese).

Cons:
1. There is camera bobbing, which can get pretty annoying, and the initial few hours of playing this game will give you a headache/motion sickness, so beware of that (my friends and I got used to it eventually).
2. At certain times of the day, if you're playing on a public lobby, either hosting or joining a random lobby, there will be a lot of people, especially children under the age of 15, who will troll you, so also be cautious of that.
3. Sometimes when you're hosting a lobby, some of the interactive parts of the workshop maps will show as moving for you, but not for the other people in your lobby. This is more of a Unity thing from the map's creator part; they may have forgotten to code some of the nodes or whatever for multiplayer version.
4. If you are hosting or joining an online multiplayer lobby, get used to the lag that follows whenever a new person joins the lobby or just the lag between you and the host. Lag happens, get used to it.

Lastly, I concocted a list of great maps to start off with a friend(s) on Reddit. Enjoy!

P.S. Feel free to add me on steam if you want to play with someone. I'll be glad to show you the ropes. If you actually want to find someone to play with at any given time or have questions regarding Unity, workshop building, or some technical stuff, join the official Human: Fall Flat Discord server for a quicker response.",Recommended,68,8

Human: Fall Flat is brilliant to play with friends, and has got to be one of the funniest games on Steam. The physics and stupidity of it all literally leaves me crying with laughter. The climbing controls are quite tricky to master, and the game could do with more content (new maps, character customisation etc), and recently I noticed that if you tab out of the game when loading it up, it will freeze your cursor and you will have to restart your pc/ laptop.

Probably the most pure fun I had while playing a game. It's so simple at first, but keeps giving new tools to play with, and with friends it's completely chaotic in the most erractic way. It's really meant to be played with friends and that's when the game trully shine. This game is the biggest example about the expression to not judge a book by it's cover.
It does not look like much, but this game gives so much with it's extraordinary gameplay that it's hard to explain how fun it is. One of the very rare game that made me cried from laughing too hard.
Ps: I have no idea how fun this game is by playing it alone, never tried. But from what I experienced, interaction with other players is what makes it so damn funny.

Edit : oh wow I never expected so much positive reactions from my little review. I'll take the chance to add a few more useful informations.

- The gameplay seems very messy at first because it takes a bit of time to get used to it, but you can really be precise once you master it. LOTS of variety in the levels. Climbing, puzzles, jumping, breaking, driving, swiming.
- The music is surprisingly very good despite being a small game.
- You will not hear it a lot, but there is a narrator that is pretty good too in the early levels.
- You like achievements? There are many achievements to get by exploring the maps, some are quite challenging!
- Yes I plan to play it a lot more, I'm far from getting bored of it.

New edit : I played it more since last time and tried more things, so here are a few other things to expect as well :

- There are more mechanism that I was expecting. It seems like almost all base maps introduce new tools to play with. Different vehicles to control, from a small boat to giant liner, truck, crane etc.
- Example of new interaction : Electricity related puzzles.
- All levels can be completed differently. You can ""cheese"" them and it's fun to do as well as beating them like how it is intended.
- The game is regularly updated. Since I got the game, the game was updated several times with new waiting room and new levels, as well as some ""official"" skins.
- You can download a crazy amount of fan made maps. Some are almost as good as the base game, they are simply not featuring achievements. Some are completely bizzare and unique. Memorable exemple that I remember : A star wars arena with laser saber, and a level where you could watch some old real cartoons like we were in cinema. Completely unexpected.",Recommended,44,0

Wow I'm quite impressed with Human: Fall Flat. I don't typically go for the wonky physics-based puzzle games, but there is a reason this is a top seller. It's very fun, and very well put together. It spoon feeds strategy to you until you have your bearings. It's never made me rage quit, and even got me to chuckle a few times. They are still pumping out content, and the multiplayer aspect is icing on the cake.

Essentially, you are controlling a dude and interact with the world by operating his left and right arm seperately. You are gonna want a controller for this. You can carry stuff around, and pull yourself up from ledges. It gets a little fancy, but not too fancy. The puzzles vary, but it's usually the put-the-box-on-the-button kind of deal.

Pros:
+Very polished and easy to play. The graphics are becoming more and more charming for me.
+It holds your hand until you get your bearings. They make the learning curve easy.
+The levels are interesting little stand-alone sandboxes that even have little secrets in store to reward those that want to stray from the main path.
+It's quite addicting because the puzzles are just challenging enough. No rage yet from me.
+There is a lot of content already, but more stuff is being added. Workshop support is being added, as well as all kinds of new skins.
+The music and lighting and ambience are very well done.
+Multiplayer is a blast.

This game is truly amazing. At first, you spend a bit of time grasping the controls and marvelling at your ability to climb and move things. Then the puzzles become more complicated (but sometimes menial). There isn't just one way to do things, either. I passed an entire part of a level because I broke a window, stacked some matresses and clambered through. You could also use a rope swing to cross a chasm instead of jumping your way across big rocks. Basically, the game has some replayability, if you wanna go back and do the level a different way. You can also do local co-op (NOTE: It's only with two gamepads, no keyboard. But you use the keyboard and mouse in singleplayer.) Co-op just makes it more ridiculous, but the puzzles stay the same. You could use your new buddy to try new ways of doing them, though. I'd say this game is worth whatever it's being sold at, because you can't put a pricetag on honest fun.",Recommended,46,0

Human: Fall Flat is a delightful and quirky physics-based puzzle game that will have you laughing, scratching your head, and grinning from ear to ear. The game's charmingly simple graphics and hilarious physics engine combine to create a truly unique and entertaining experience.

As the player character, you control a floppy, malleable human who stumbles, falls, and flails their way through a series of physics-based puzzles. Whether you're swinging from grappling hooks, dragging boxes across precarious platforms, or using catapults to launch yourself across gaps, every moment is a hilarious and unpredictable adventure.

What makes Human: Fall Flat truly special, though, is its emphasis on creativity and experimentation. The game encourages players to try new things, to think outside the box, and to come up with their own solutions to each puzzle. There's no one ""right"" way to complete a level, and the freedom to explore and experiment is what makes the game so incredibly fun and engaging.

But what really sets Human: Fall Flat apart is its sense of humor. The game is full of slapstick moments, absurd situations, and tongue-in-cheek references to pop culture and other video games. From the various costumes you can dress your character in to the hilarious sound effects and dialogue, the game is a non-stop barrage of laughs and giggles.

Overall, Human: Fall Flat is a delightful and refreshing take on the physics-based puzzle game genre. Its charming graphics, hilarious physics engine, and emphasis on creativity and experimentation make it a must-play for anyone who loves a good laugh and a fun challenge.",Recommended,39,0

Human: Fall Flat is one those hidden gems that manages to take you by surprise and offer you a really well thought-out experience. The game itself is visually simple in style, but fantastic in its presentation. There is a genuine adventure to find here and it can only be achieved if you continue playing it.

At first glance, it gives the impression for being a linear puzzle game. From the mechanics and controls to the environment - it does seem like just an ordinary game that relies on its experimental physics. Yet, there is a layer of wonder to it and shows us that a lot of love and care went into making it very fun for the player. Once you've progressed past the first couple of stages, get ready to discover huge areas to explore.

You are free to approach each stage however you please. Many of them encourage creativity since it offers you more than one way of completing an obstacle. Not to mention that every one of them is challenging enough to feel rewarding at the end, because there is a clear logic to their design. While the motions of the character may seem confusing at first, you will eventually learn how to control them and be more accurate with their actions.

The soundtrack is perfect, helping you relax as you try to figure out the puzzle in front of you, which fits in with the gentle nature of this game. And if you think the solo playthrough isn't pleasing, then you are in luck. With split-screen support you can invite a friend over and complete the game together, making the adventure a lot more hilarious. Go for it!

I'm definitely going to recommend Human: Fall Flat.",Recommended,43,0

Overall Rating - Average ★★★☆☆

First Impressions
Human Fall Flat (HFF) was a very popular game on YouTube. I saw people floundering and flopping around, seemingly struggling with the controls to make the doughy characters move the way they wanted. It's not a game I was going out of my way to get, but when it came up in a bundle, I went for it. I played HFF with a friend when they visited me, and though I wouldn't say it was a complete blast, it was more fun than I might have thought otherwise.


Gameplay
The best way I can describe HFF is to call it a platformer, with puzzles and obstacles you have to navigate around. In other games, you'd make use of a double-jump, and very quickly get past anything this game has to offer. However, the only things at your disposal are short jumps, pulling yourself up onto ledges, and interacting with levers, steering wheels, and other simple tools. You'll use these abilities, in spite of the clunky controls, in order to knock down barriers, open doors, and get to elevated areas, so you can progress to the next stage.


It'd be easy to dismiss the controls in this game as bad, but they actually work “well.” For instance, I usually found it easy to climb up ledges, as you lift your hands over your head, jump up so they'll latch onto the platform, and pull your view down so you pull yourself up. The bigger difficulty came from picking things up off the ground, as getting your hands at the right angle can be hard. Sloppy controls are part of the obstacle and fun of this game, although I'd be lying if I said they never frustrated me. Another big issue was with the camera, as your character will get in the way of seeing where his hands are located, or as you try to move an object into the right location.


At the beginning and end, you'll read a few messages from radios you pick up, but that's as far as the story goes. I think they could have added more here, and emphasized the humor of the game, but it's fine without a plot. As you come across different stages and situations, there are some background elements that hint at what's going on, but they're really just obstacles to overcome.


The visuals are pretty good. Objects that make up the environment and items you can interact with are three dimensional, and as you make contact, have a sense of gravity and physics. I think the art style has a pleasant softness to it, and has good color schemes for the variety of settings. For instance, the ice stage has trees and other background elements to contrast against the white snow. Plus, snow falls from the sky. You're also able to customize your character with different costumes, with many skins available in the mod community.


When going out of my way to listen to the music, it's surprisingly somber sounding. I didn't necessarily expect goofy sound effects or carnival music, but the soundtrack would be suitable for a story-rich, dramatic game. It really comes off as incongruent, because the gameplay is too silly, yet the music is very good. There are sound effects, such as when you crash into the ground and use machines, but it's somewhat limited. Everything seemed to fit well enough though.


🌟 There are a reasonable number of checkpoints scattered throughout each stage. Also, if you're playing with others, only one person needs to reach it, for everyone to benefit.
🌟 You can play the entire game by yourself, but it's much more fun if you play with others. I don't know what it'd be like, but it claims you can play with a total of eight people.
🌟 The game has a nice variety in stages and obstacles to deal with. Plus, if you're skilled or explore enough, there are shortcuts to skip past different sections.


❌ There was one section in the Aztec stage that I found incredibly aggravating. It involved a platform on a lever, and two boxes. Getting the platform to cooperate, while moving boxes onto it, was difficult, even after figuring out what needed to be done. Thankfully, this was the worst part of the game, and later areas weren't any harder than this.
❌ Although the time it took me to beat the game was fairly high, there's not very many stages to play through. I'd have enjoyed more of them, with simpler challenges, just to enjoy navigating around in more areas. Stumbling about is part of the fun.


🔍 Controlling the direction you face is essential in order to play HFF. It's not hard, but it feels different from other games I've played, and takes some time to get used to. After all, normally I wouldn't need to face a specific direction in order to climb up onto a platform, or grab an object.
🔍 I found that lifting my arms up made it easier to carry objects, as they otherwise drag against the ground. This is also good life advice.


It's hard to quantify what makes the experience of HFF enjoyable, because on the surface, it shouldn't work. The situations that players deal with can be somewhat whimsical and interesting, but the tasks themselves would be significantly easier in most other games. Although there were times I got aggravated with the title, it wasn't as rage-inducing as I'd have thought, in spite of how long it takes to do fairly simple things. That being said, I played the game with someone else, and think it'd be a much different experience if I'd done it alone. I wouldn't suggest anyone go out of their way to get this game, because surprisingly enough there's quite a few releases that deliver similar experiences. However, I still recommend HFF, as I had more fun with it than I thought I would.",Recommended,40,2

Good game, but beware.

Devs/Publisher pulled a really nasty move and silently removed Linux support.

Not only removing it, but entirely breaking it by walling off Linux users to play with Win/OSX users due to version checks.
Could be fixed if the Linux depot would be deleted, but that is apparently too hard.

Now to play again with other platforms, Linux users have to force Steam to download the Windows version and use Proton.",Recommended,119,6

What a wholesome and hilarious game!

Spent hours in fits of laughter with friends because, at times, the only way to finish a level is to grab someone's butt while swinging towards the exit gate. Controlling a ""strange-little-human-blob-thing"" that defies all laws of physics adds to the fun.

It's the type of game that can turn any bad day around. A genuinely good and uplifting experience.",Recommended,51,0

Such a great little game! I played co-op with my 7yr old daughter and we had a BLAST! She keeps asking if we can play ""the floppy guy game"". After she went to bed, I played co-op with my wife and we were laughing so hard we could hardly play at times! My wife isn't really a gamer, but we used to play Portal 2 together and this was a similar ""work together to win"" kind of game, only much more hilarious!

My daughter and I actually beat this in about 6-7 hours but that didn't really matter, we're still playing it.

The controls seemed to be fairly difficult for my wife to get used to, but it didn't seem to bother her too much because it just made for some really comical moments. I would also like to note that watching 2 other people play this game is almost as fun as playing it yourself.

Simple yet appealling art, easy puzzles - yet Bob makes them challenging as Bob decided to drink a case of Vodka before attempting to escape using parkour methods.

Only negative I would say is the Co-op isn't LAN, it's Splitscreen (well at time of writing anyway)
If this was Online Multiplayer or LAN Co-op, purchasing would be a no brainer.

Review by Games for Lovers - only GOOD local co-op games!

You want to play something with your significant other?

Human: Fall Flat is a rather stress-free physic-based puzzler with a unique style to enjoy together in split-screen mode (or with 8 players in online mode). Multiple solutions are possible for almost every puzzle, you can interact with many of the objects you find while wandering around in the dreamworld.

The controls will make your character look like a drunk person walking on a tightrope. This alone makes the game hilarious, especially if you watch your partner’s ineptitude.

Works fine with XBox 360 gamepads.

A fantastic introspective on what it means to be human. Much like in real life, you control a bumbling, squishy specimen tasked with solving a variety of problems, mundane or otherwise. Most YouTubers and casual gamers only see a funny ragdoll meme game. But not me. I believe that this game is a true metaphor for life. In fact, the game is highly metaphorical in almost every aspect. The multiple ways to get around a problem is a metaphor for free will. The way that when you fall off the map you land right back on it is a metaphor for starting again when you've made a big mistake. The act of falling to end a level is a metaphor for the ""rollercoaster of life"" philosophy, which states that when you are at your highest point, you can only go downhill from there. The game's levels take you through the essentials of what it truly means to be a human. Whether you're destroying walls with a wrecking ball (a stunning metaphor for how society breaks itself down over time), exploring a medieval-themed land which requires you to perform exhausting manual labor to find your way to the end, or rewiring power through circuitry to open doors, you're learning a new life lesson about what makes you you. The character customization is insane. You can make almost any type of human you want. You can even be a dog. But no matter what you are or what your character looks like, you will be climbing your way to victory, much like we humans strive for success in everything we do. This game is brilliant. I have never seen a game that takes itself and its subject so seriously. What an absolute masterpiece. 10/10

I got this nominated for Steam's ""Labor of Love"" award. (27 Nov, 2017 @ 10:02am)

The game looks like it was originally designed for single player. Playing the game with just keyboard and mouse may discourage a lot of people so it is recommended to use a controller. Solving the puzzles to advance into the game is fun. Playing local-coop adds more fun. However, because of the extra player, you'll be able to advance through a lot of puzzles without really solving them, it makes the game a lot easier because the stage is not adjusted for co-op.

A lot of people may not like the game because of the controls, you have to control the left and right hand individually and the camera is tied to your movement; you'll be looking up to reach things and then be looking down while climbing. Some extras about the game are the easter eggs, some alternate/absurd ways to advance through the puzzles, and customizable look/color for the character.

People with no local-coop partners requested for online multiplayer and the devs added it as a free update. This is why I had it voted for a steam award. The online multiplayer support for this game features 8 players and that breaks the default games stages. With this, I hope they add more stages designed for co-op. Workshop support would also help the game a lot so players can make their own stages and have it designed to be solved by 2, 3 or 4 players.",Recommended,40,1

Human Fall Flat - A Quirky and Physics-Based Puzzle Adventure

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

Human Fall Flat, developed by No Brakes Games, is a quirky and physics-based puzzle adventure that offers a unique and entertaining gameplay experience. Players take on the role of Bob, a wobbly and whimsical character who must navigate through a series of challenging levels using his unconventional movement abilities and problem-solving skills.

Graphics: ★★★☆☆
The graphics in Human Fall Flat adopt a charming and minimalist art style that adds to the game's whimsical atmosphere. While the visuals may not be the most detailed or realistic, they suit the game's comedic and lighthearted tone. The physics-based animations of Bob and the interactive objects in the environment provide a sense of playfulness and unpredictability.

Gameplay: ★★★★☆
The gameplay of Human Fall Flat revolves around controlling Bob's ragdoll-like character to solve physics-based puzzles. Players must manipulate objects, climb, swing, and jump through the levels, all while navigating the challenges presented by the game's unique physics engine. The controls can feel intentionally clumsy, adding to the game's humor and creating hilarious situations as Bob stumbles and flops his way through the obstacles.

Puzzles and Challenges: ★★★★☆
Human Fall Flat offers a variety of puzzles and challenges that require creative thinking and experimentation. Each level presents a different environment with its own set of obstacles and puzzles to overcome. From using objects to create makeshift ramps to swinging on ropes and levers, players must find unique solutions to progress. The open-ended nature of the puzzles encourages exploration and invites players to approach challenges in their own way.

Cooperative Multiplayer: ★★★★☆
One of the standout features of Human Fall Flat is its cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing players to team up with friends or other online players to tackle the puzzles together. The multiplayer aspect adds an additional layer of fun and laughter as players collaborate or unintentionally hinder each other's progress, leading to amusing and unpredictable moments.

Replayability: ★★★☆☆
While Human Fall Flat may not have extensive replay value in terms of storyline or branching paths, its physics-based gameplay and cooperative multiplayer mode offer some replayability. The joy of experimenting with the game's physics, discovering new ways to solve puzzles, and the potential for different experiences with friends make it worth revisiting.

Conclusion:
Human Fall Flat delivers a unique and entertaining experience with its quirky physics-based gameplay, charming visuals, and cooperative multiplayer mode. The game's humor, puzzle design, and open-ended approach provide a refreshing break from traditional puzzle-solving games. Whether playing solo or with friends, Human Fall Flat offers plenty of laughter-filled moments and enjoyable challenges, making it a worthwhile adventure for those seeking a lighthearted and creative gaming experience.",Recommended,29,1

Notes:
The game is a puzzle solving game, with rag-doll like movement. WASD to move and right and left click to grab. Have you ever played ""Getting Over It""? It can get that frustrating at times, especially if you play for a while or after a difficult day. The one complaint I have is how frustrating the mechanics are, and its not even a complaint. I just get really frustrated when it doesn't act the way I want it to. The level design is either intended for speed-running, or idiotic. There are entire sections of levels that can be skipped by giving it some thought, and I like that, but there are some places that seem like they didn't try to prevent skips.
I have never encountered a bug in my 20+ hours on this game, which is awesome. Plus, they release a new level every once in a while. I got 20 something hours from doing a couple of plays and all of the achievements, and you could get even more from downloading levels from the workshop. All in all, I think that if this game is on sale, you should probably grab it!

9/10 because of some frustrating late nights trying to get some achievements!",Recommended,34,0

I enjoyed the game, mainly because of my friends that got it too but also because it has the sensation of goofiness. Playing with my friends made it even better and we had great times, at least in my opinion, but the only thing that this game is kinda boring is the maps. There's only, what, 7 maps? Like many others have said, so shall I. We need workshop maps. Let those who are creative map makers do their thing.",Recommended,25,0

Played the game in coop and it was sooo much fun. Just exploring, trying stuff out, laughing about the quirky little guys doing stupid things and beating the (very varied) puzzles. Starts off pretty easy (after you figured out the controls) and gets pretty hard in the end, up to the point, that we were asking ourselves how to beat the game solo. Coop makes this game so much easier (try not to exploit it too much).

I played this with my niece who was more interested in throwing me off ledges and causing chaos than solving puzzles, but still, the game presents a good number of fun and memorable challenges. There were a few times it felt like we bypassed a big chunk of a map accidentally, given a lack of clear objectives and areas that went untouched, and the wobbly character/camera can get a bit nauseating, but overall it's worthy of a play. We invested about 13 hours including all the time my niece spent choosing her outfit.

Good game, but beware.

Devs/Publisher pulled a really nasty move and silently removed Linux support.

Not only removing it, but entirely breaking it by walling off Linux users to play with Win/OSX users due to version checks.
Could be fixed if the Linux depot would be deleted, but that is apparently too hard.

Now to play again with other platforms, Linux users have to force Steam to download the Windows version and use Proton.

I'm not against the decision, it's understandable that more platforms are a pain to a small team, but this could have been handled extremely better than it has been.",Not Recommended,"1,676 people found this review helpful

Been playing this with my daughter (she's nearly 11), and its been a lot of fun. We both take joy in being able to find solutions to the puzzles that aren't nessecarily the ""right"" way to do it, and the mishaps that occur as we try. (We spent ages with the boats and the water wheel in the Water level but because we were doing it together it never got boring or made us want to switch off)

The music is lovely, but minimal.
Graphics are simple but effective. We grew quite attached to our gooy avatars, even more so once we decked them out.



Two thumbs up from both of us.",Recommended,20,0

I had never heard of this game before until this week, and I don't know how because it is superb. Your character has sort of the floppy, flailing, uncontrolled type of movement you find in games like Gang Beasts and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, so it is rather challenging to control your character. The game sends you through a series of puzzle levels similar in nature to what you would find in the Portal games, and has multi-player co-op levels in addition to single-player. The co-op levels are designed to be completed by two players, but you can have up to four players in a session. The only problem with this is that sometimes one or two players can be left without anything to do for a certain task, but having more than two players can also help with finding solutions quicker and completing difficult parkour and timing-based tasks that will inevitably require many tries to get right.

The main frustrating thing about this game is that you can end up getting yourself into situations where you must reset the level at your last checkpoint. You will have to deal with moving unwieldy objects from one place to another using your floppy controls, and sometimes these objects will get stuck somewhere and won't de-spawn and re-spawn, meaning you'll have to reset the checkpoint. This isn't bad on some checkpoints, but some require more tasks or more difficult tasks than others.

Another issue is that objects sometimes re-spawn in bad positions where they are unusable, such as a gondola being upside down or a vehicle spawning on full-throttle forward, so you'll have to reset the checkpoint until everything spawns correctly. Your character may also be spawned in a place where you'll immediately fall of the edge of the map or into the water, causing you to die instantly. Your character may also be spawned stuck inside a solid object, which will probably require a checkpoint reset again.

But overall, this game is a lot of fun, especially in co-op mode. With the hilarious character physics, the rage-inducing challenges, and the humor provided in the game, you are bound to have a good laugh with your friends. If you want something that you can play with friends to keep you occupied for a while, I highly recommend this.",Recommended,16,0

Recommended, but with caveats.

The game is mostly fun, and I got some real moments out of enjoyment out of some of the puzzles and especially out of the character.

The feel is a little like Octodad meets Portal, but without the soul of either, and that's part of the issue. You get a snarky narrator for all of, like, thirty seconds, and then the game is mostly played in silence. The music is nice...when it's there. The whole thing feels a little empty. The world looks like it has interesting stories to tell, but you'll never know, because there's no substance beneath the puzzles.

By the end of the four hour play time, some of the puzzles start to wear thin. Especially because the second-to-last level is frustrating, what with all the water around that makes even the smallest screw up into a drowning offense. Be prepared to respawn and restart puzzles there a lot...which is not fun. Also, the final level feels pretty repetitive over most of its length, which isn't great.

Where Portal and Octodad left me wanting more, I was perfectly happy to be done with this game in the end. I didn't really want to spend any more time working through the world.

I hope there's more support, maybe some new levels provided that provide more diversity. But one of the core problems, the ultimate hollowness of the game, isn't going to be fixed by patches. The narrator at the beginning makes it feel like the devs wanted to make this a more fleshed out experience, and just ran out of time or money.

If you're in to wonky, physics-based puzzlers, this is worth picking up. If you want them to have some depth, keep looking.",Recommended,16 people found this review helpful 0,1

It's not easy to get your 'physics degree' in this game, but once you're there, it's satisfying to accomplish the majority of the mini-tasks in the levels — unless you want to complete all levels on your own, and it will become a chore to play! The game is definitely meant to be played with friends, and as with a notice like: ""A controller is strongly recommended to play [game]"", there should be one here: ""A friend (or two) is strongly recommended to play Human: Fall Flat""; emphasizing friend here, because it seems common in this P2P-game for hosts to 1) be indifferent about their session settings, choosing options like public + join game in progress: enabled; 2) that, followed with an instant kick of the players who joined a game in progress ... (don't take it personally!)

I bought this game a looooonngg time ago when you could only play alone or split screen. But now that the game has the option of playing online, I definitely recommend getting this game and playing it with your friends. If you don't mind playing with random people or by yourself, I guess that's okay too if you don't mind being lonely like I do (lol). Plus, working with strangers is always an adventure.

Anyway, this game is all about physics, puzzles, and the labor of manually climbing. There are currently 9 levels to get through. You will struggle and you will stress, but it's still fun for some reason... There is also the option of character customization which is great, especially when you play online and look at other people's characters.

TL;DR: Jam packed with secrets to encourage exploration and so many paths to take it's hard to tell which was the intended way. Solo, multiplayer, skins, workshop support, this game has everything it needs to become even more amazing and endearing than it already is!

Puzzle folks, physics folks, fun-loving folks, rejoice!

Human: Fall flat is a romp through myriad trials of your squishy human body with the ultimate goal being conquest of your environment. Be it destruction, climbing, teamwork, or even construction and maintenance aided by heavy machinery, the simple controls and aesthetic hide away the breadth of activites in the game.

Hilarious mechanics relying on the sometimes less-than-gracious procedural animation system leads to silly and often unexpected ways of getting around and getting the job done. That isn't to say the controls don't lend themselves to finesse with a bit of skill and timing. From flopping lazily over chasms to deftly monkeying over and around puzzles in a few levels, the game is deceptively easy to pick up but hard to master.

Level design allows for shortcuts and endless creativity. You'll be surprised how many times you think ""oh, THIS'LL break the game/skip the level!"" and suddenly an achievement pops and you're faced with yet another puzzle; the devs knew you'd do that and rewarded you. I've played the game twice solo and once with a friend in the new multiplayer mode and consistently find new ways to get through the level. Siege is so vast and yet so dense and mysterious, I could spend hours going hand-over-hand up those ziplines. If only I had 3 friends to explore with me!

Customizing my character must be at least an hour and a half of my time in this game, you can select from tons of clothing options, customize them, then paint logos on them, paint tattoos, and share them with your friends or the world on the workshop. More architecturally inclined? Build a level to challenge yourself or frustrate your friends, and again upload it to the workshop for fame and fortune!

The game is admittedly short for those wanting to speedrun it, likely completeable in about an hour or two the first time, but it's no less fun and you'll likely either want to perfect a speedrun or find the secrets after passing so many by on a fast run. Exploration is truly rewarding and reall the way to go anyways, as that's where the bulk of the content is. Not only are there secrets, there are shortcuts or ways to get around that are far more fun than object puzzles!

Human: Fall Flat is essentially what a story mode in Gang Beasts would be if they moved away from the combat-focused model. It has the climbing and carrying mechanics you want from Gang Beasts with consideraly more finesse and control over hand placement, throwing, and body position.

Keep in mind this is NOT an Early Access title that's been abandoned, but a fully released game that's still getting love and care from the devs. This is such nice dev behavior to see in the age of abandonware, I feel that commitment alone warrants a second look at this title. The devs are also passionate about bringing the best mechanics into the game and are cognizant of player suggestions.

PROS:

Human: Fall Flat is definitely a game that can be recommended to everyone. Pretty nice music, well-designed levels that you can both finish alone or with your friends on both local and online cooperative mode. Unfortunately game is pretty short, but that shouldn't be a problem, because developers enrich the game content with updates and new levels, so the game is getting more and more content which makes it longer to play. The Steam workshop and community of this game is pretty good as well, so if you will finish the game, you can always download some new levels from there.
I would highly recommend that game to you and your friends, it's one of the most fun cooperative games for sure!",Recommended,19,0

+ The game is incredibly fun! Your character moves and behaves in a silly way like it's made out of jelly, but honestly controls incredibly well. You complete all sorts of physics based puzzles by moving, pushing, platforming, climbing, and so fourth.
+ There are multiple ways of completing many of the puzzles and stages which gives the game a nice sense of replayability as you will no doubt think of new ways to solve puzzles on your second playthrough. I found this to be so refreshing as I was often searching for ways to skip past puzzles I did not want to solve which often included some crazy parkour or creating some alternate route.
+ Very creative levels and puzzles
+ A surprising amount of vehicles that you must control entirely with movements from your character. Catapults, Cranes, Various types of boats, a truck and so fourth. I found it pretty amazing that you actually have to grab the paddles, and row yourself to shore in a canoe on one stage.
+ The way the character moves can be very comical at times as it flops around.
+ Character creator, which lets you paint and if you have a webcam paste pictures onto your character.
+ Great soundtrack that fits the vibe of the game very well.

- I feel like the story was a bit lacking. At the beginning I had thought I was supposed to explore and discover something at the end, but nothing really happens.
- A bit short in length, although the last 2 stages are incredibly long.

The game in question is a veritable gem in split screen co-op (and dual monitor) for aficionados of physics-based puzzles. It must be acknowledged that the level design is a significant contributor to this. The levels have been meticulously crafted to fully exploit the game's unique physics system. Playing locally in co-op or online with up to eight players is an exceedingly enjoyable experience.

Regrettably, the only blemish, as previously noted, is its lifespan. The ability to create one's own levels does little to offset this deficiency. While there are currently 500 levels available, the inherent nature of the game's style makes it exceedingly difficult to construct a novel and engaging puzzle. Even if one manages to do so, once it has been solved, there is little incentive to revisit it. Furthermore, levels that cater to a more uninhibited style, such as platformers or ski slopes, are ill-suited to the game's physics engine, often causing it to crash and resulting in an unsatisfactory and unresponsive experience.

It would be unrealistic to anticipate levels akin to those found in GTA5, as the physics engine is primarily designed for the somewhat mundane task of puzzle-solving. While I thoroughly enjoyed this game, I can only offer it a score of seven due to its inherently limited lifespan, despite the developers' best efforts to offer a multiplayer mode and a workshop. This is due to the strength and weakness of its physics engine.",Recommended,51,0

i am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Recommended,261,0

As a 50-year-old single father of two, life's challenges often felt like insurmountable obstacles, especially after the tragic loss of my beloved wife. Grieving, I found solace in the virtual world of Human Fall Flat, a whimsical game that unexpectedly became my lifeline.

Through its charming puzzles and quirky physics, Human Fall Flat offered me not just a distraction, but a new perspective on life. As I navigated the game's whimsical landscapes alongside my children, laughter replaced tears, and joy slowly began to fill the void left by loss.

With each puzzle conquered and each silly mishap shared with my kids, I rediscovered the simple pleasures of companionship and play. Human Fall Flat became more than just a game; it became a catalyst for healing and a beacon of hope for brighter days ahead.

In the end, Human Fall Flat taught me that even in the darkest of times, there's always a glimmer of light waiting to guide us back to happiness. And for that, I'll forever be grateful.",Recommended,30,3

I bought this game because me and my friend was bored and looking for something we could play together over the weekend. We were not expecting much from this game. But I am glad to say that we are not disappointed. This is a very fun and sometimes challenging puzzle game. The mechanics that are used in this game is really great. What really took me by surprise is two things. One the fact that there are multiple ways to complete a puzzle some easy some hard but all fun. And two in some of the areas there are places you have to explore. There are tons of stuff to see and do in this game. I absolutely love it. Definitely worth the money",Recommended,26,0

I'm pretty sure you've played this or something like it on a Flash site before. Take a hapless mook and rough 'em up with explosives or bicycles or catapults or what have you until their ragdoll spasms get a chuckle out of you. I didn't expect much from Happy Room and I got exactly what I did, plenty of silly, gory action with goofy contraptions. And it even exceeded my expectations in a few little ways, enough to keep me chucking clones into the meat grinder.

You've got the best job in the world, testing weapon systems on meaty specimens without any of those pesky ethical concerns to stop you. Starting with basic mines, spikes, and guns, you earn additional funds for new instruments of destruction as you prove the worth of the tools at your disposal. These quickly branch out into useful and goofy devices like launch pads, zero-gravity generators, buzzsaws, morning stars, and so on. There are also special objectives to complete for bonus funds and points to upgrade your weapons with. The more damage you do, the more damage-dealing goodies you get to play with. Simple.

A typical gameplay loop consists of setting up your murder chamber, running the test, and then seeing how things panned out. If you didn't beat your previous best you don't get anything so you have to rearrange your killbox for greater lethality. And if you did do more damage, you get more money so you can make the room even nastier. At specific total damage values you get new toys, split into explosive, gun, spike, and miscellaneous categories. Certain unlocks make a huge difference like launch pads that keep your dummy moving past traps, portals that can warp him around the room, and sawblades you can make sick little conveyor belts with. You'll also have four side objectives to complete at any given time, like stick ten crossbow bolts in the dummy or have him frozen and on fire at once. Completing these earns you upgrade points that give your tools important new abilities, such as allowing them to attach to ceilings or reach further or do more damage.

Each test ends when the dummy stops moving and stops taking damage, and most of your equipment is stationary so a major goal is working out a system to keep him going as long as possible. Nearly everything has ammo (actually more like durability) including spikes and sawblades so you can't keep him going forever. This sounds like a weird limitation but it works in practice because it focuses strategy on bouncing the dummy between all of your traps, not just cornering him with a tiny killbox. It also gives rise to entertaining tools like the big rockets he can get stuck on and the superlasers that smash him into the opposite wall.

Your dummy suffers visual effects for whatever he suffers, whether it be fire or acid or being nibbled to death by piranhas, so prepare for some gruesome scenes as you get better at abusing him. A handy status screen shows you how much damage he's taken to each of his ragdolly parts, helpful for determining where you need to focus your efforts. The final break point for damage actually kills the dummy, which awards you an -ALITY for whatever struck the killing blow. There are achievements for each of these to keep you invested after unlocking everything and perfecting your murder machines. You'll be spending plenty of time just getting to that point and chasing the many side objectives, so don't expect to be done with the game anytime soon if you like messing dudes up.

There are only a few weak points worth mentioning, all pretty minor. For one, the rough English on some objectives and upgrades can add some guesswork to what you're doing. Also this can go either way but tests never run the same way twice, even if you don't change a thing between them. This might frustrate meticulous or impatient types but I kinda liked running a single room multiple times to see how good it could get or if it ever freaked out. Overall Happy Room proved to be more engrossing than I ever thought it would be. It's the kind of game where I'll play for 30 minutes, then go back to work and suddenly realize I should have hooked up the tesla nodes to the piranha tanks, and then excitedly tell my coworker what I figured out and end up in a meeting with HR that afternoon. Totally worth it, because sometimes you just want some dumb fun and Happy Room is that, plus a little extra.

Lugubrious ragdoll fun! Destroy them with a large variety of weapons, and perform tasks to progress your funds!



This one plays a lot like the main mode, Laboratory, but with different weapons. Laboratory has an experimental setting, while Dungeon has more of a classic vibe.
You start with some bombs, and on the top of the screen there are four quests that reward money to be able to place more weapons in your room, and upgrade weapons with a second currency. For example the quest can be to hit one dummy four times with bombs. When you complete a quest, you immediately receive a new one. Some quests require just some slight adjustments to the room, but most quests require a dedicated layout, and most resources in one type of weaponry. New weapons are unlocked by improving your turn record of damage to the dummy.
At the final parts of the quest you are tasked to deliver the killing blow with a certain type of weapon. Those are tied to the achievements for this game, together with the quest progress.

The idea of this mode is that the mouse cursor is a weapon. Your mouse can be an axe, a shotgun, or a firespewing dragon for instance, and you pay for every hit or shot. There are still some items that are placed beforehand in the room, such as trampolines.

Besides the modes there are also new achievements for sandbox mode, to kill a dummy with every and only weapons from a category, such as explosives. Or simply every weapon in this game!

It was fun to return to this ridiculous game! When playing through a mode, you can get a bit burned out with the mechanics. You basically are doing the same thing over and over again with minor differences. Some of the challenges are very tough, but those are the ones I remember best from nearly five years ago! Like a challenge to be hit a bird in sandbox, by launching a dummy into the sky! If you rather see the rooms do their thing, and don't feel particularly like building the room, you can find community made rooms in the workshop.

This game is just simple fun. It's only sold here on Steam, and goes for €2,49 during sales. Not many of my friends own this game. Recommended by me!

OMG where to start:
This game is about bringing as much death to dummys and you can spend hours on it.

Pros:

gameplay- this game is really fun
graphics- are supprisingly good
upgrades- there are so many upgrades its unbelieveable
freeroam- you can whatever you want
weapons-there are more weapons than i have braincells
achievement/tasks- get this you get money and upgrade point for killing and torturing the dummys

cons:

price- allthough i think this game i dont think its worth £4 but obviously its not a lot
length- this game isnt very long like 2-3 hours but you can just use what uve got
time- it takes a while to get even 1 upgrade point but it can be a good thing if youre looking for length ;)

overall i think that this game is a good one but they need to make the game longer but ill see what happens in the future

I play this game on the weekends, when I'm at work, and I absolutely love this game. Happy Room allows you to create your own deathtraps, and see how they work out. The fun, and sometimes annoying, thing is the different dummies react differently. For example, I'll set a bouncer to fling the dummy toward the wall and then get blasted by a death ray, and maybe have him land on a spike trap... On a test run, I'll see where one dummy lands, but following dummies land in different areas. So, you really have to work at destroying these dummies.
The only thing that I would say that they could do, to REALLY make this game above and beyond, I wish you could edit the dummies. If there was a mode, or something, that allowed you to edit the dummies to look like other people that would put this game over the top. I'm sure I'm not the only one... There's other people out there that has just had a bad day, and you edit the dummy to look like someone that rubbed you the wrong way, and then blow them to hell and back... It turns your day around.
I highly recommend this title. It's cheap, it's insanely fun and addictive, and I would only add that one small feature. Other than that, GREAT GAME!!!",Recommended,6,3

I am not a fan of such games, because of blood mostly. However, this one is quite ok. It reminded me of Happy Wheels. I would not say this is an action game only. It is 50 % pazzle .
So, pros are:
- quite addictive game;
- achievements may be completed in diferent ways;
- it is possible just to do whatever you want not just what achievements say;
- even if game is finished and no achievements left, you still can have some fun finding out what more you can do;
cons:
- if you Do Not like blood and take things personal this game is not for you;
- the game can be completed in few hours if you are a good player and completely into it solving all the tasks...",Recommended,11 people found this review helpful 0,1

Achievements: All possible, none are too difficult.

Pros/Cons:
+ Addicting
+ Very stress relieving
+ Many unique weapons/tools that unlock through play
+ Upgrade system
+ Different modes (normal, sandbox, desert)
+ Nice grid system to place things down precisely
+ Unlockable hats/costumes
+ Great time killer
+ Cheap
+ Rooms can be uploaded/downloaded from the workshop

+/- It definitely has that unpolished flash game look/feel. I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing, though.

- Some upgrades can entirely change the purpose of an item
- Some items can be tedious to place a lot of
- There's no faster fast-forward than 2x

Overall:
Happy Room was a fun little time killer. Blowing some poor guy apart was incredibly stress relieving and I don't care what that says about me as a person. It was really fun to test out different strategies and find out different ways to do the most damage or land the last hit with a certain weapon. Give it a shot if you're bored.",Recommended,7,0

To anyone having issues where the dummy will not show, restart steam.

The game (so far) has many things to toture this poor soul with, however i think some issues need to be fixed.
It can get frustrating to have to reboot steam every time you wanna play the game.

But if you can look past that, this is a fun little sandbox game.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

As much as i do enjoy it, and as new as it is, im suprised to see that its broke on me, on my attempt to get the full bar on mines (already got freezality or whatever its called) i was shocked to see that i couldnt spend the rest of my money on grenade launchers to try and get the dummy to move away from walls, and to do extra damage, if i could i would be able to buy much, because of my limited money, but nethertheless it would have helped alot, also some of the missions for extra money may be impossible, or too difficult for some users, and mabye you should add a box mode, like on the home screen when you hole down left mouse button to one place to another? add that when you need to place down stuff in box's, like if im trying to sort out mines to make sure there is as many as possible, i can just drag it and instead of placing it down constantly, it makes a box so its sorted, also do that for walls, floor and ceiling, i think it'd be a great touch!

Happy Room is an absolute blast! The combination of creative weaponry and the sandbox-style environment allows for endless experimentation and excitement. The game play mechanics are smooth, and the physics engine adds an extra layer of realism to the chaos.

What sets Happy Room apart is its perfect balance between challenge and enjoyment. Whether you're devising elaborate traps or simply unleashing mayhem, every moment is filled with adrenaline-pumping action. The variety of tools and weapons keeps things fresh, ensuring that each play through is a unique experience.

The graphics are vibrant and quirky, perfectly complementing the game's light-hearted yet delightfully chaotic atmosphere. Additionally, the sound effects add to the immersion, making every explosion and collision feel satisfyingly impactful.

Overall, Happy Room is a must-play for anyone looking for a fun and engaging experience. It's a game that will keep you coming back for more, eager to discover new ways to unleash destruction and rack up high scores. Highly recommended!",Recommended,2 people found this review helpful 1,0

This game is interesting - Like any Gibbing type of game, in its current state it WILL lose its fun value. Things need to be added in order to keep it fun - Such as Sharing and Creation type of aspect to the game - As soon as you unlock everything and Play around for a bit, Then its just the same thing over and over.

However i will say that for the $5CDN that this costs, You will definatly get your moneys worth, Its fun while it lasts, and you will definatly get a few hours of play time out of it. I Recommend this game, but i hope that they add a bunch of things in the future to keep it interesting,

Happy Room is a game with not a lot of content and not a lot of replayability. The game is most fun for the first half an hour or so, when there's still an element of puzzle involved in trying to complete objectives to progress. However, once you complete the grind and unlock every weapon in the game, there's little more to do besides achievement hunting. In fact, half my total play time has been dedicated to achievement hunting.

However, being priced at under $10 for a few hours of game time, it actually can be a good timewaster. It can be fun (and somewhat sadistic) to watch a test dummy get ripped apart by a bunch of lasers, but that enjoyment only lasts a few hours at most.",Not Recommended,62,0

Almost done completing all the achievements.
It's been a hell of a ride.
But the dummy thought it was going to heaven.

I've had a *blast* playing this game. It cheers me up whenever I have the sudden urge to watch someone die in the most destructive way possible.
I would have been more than *happy* to pay $20 for this game if I knew it'd be this fun. Luckily for my cheap ass, it was only $5.
Ragdoll physics have always fascinated me and this takes the cake for best ragdoll game of all time.
It's also great that even if you have the same setup, you won't always get the same result like some ragdoll games.

it may take time to do certain things, some take dedication, and sometimes it can be tedious
but i will say that every time i have stopped playing, there was something to play for again
i do not know what this issue is of mine but i cant find a reason to stop for good

""what is this game""
punish the clones made in the secret laboratory somewhere underground
use various methods (to inflict/of) harm and pain
watch him dismember into a red chunk of meat
""wauughh! auuhhg!""

your past any help i could give you. all you can do now is pray.
FATALITY.

""okay, but i cant do that yet, i can just place 3 saws""
118 tasks for you to do to gain credits and upgrade points (some hair ripping)

""i jammed him.""
3 other modes for you to play (and one where you just toss him)

you want dungeon? reheheehe yes, murder and torture and kill-
you want armory? (its a bit too easy but i like axeplay)
you want sandbox? be careful, he has x4 health
you want... some desert.. where you just launch him.... okay!!!!

3 skins with special sounds/visuals
56 hats to fall off your dummy
several fatalities to be had

can you get them all?

average time of player enjoyment: 2-5 hours
time to fully complete: around 3 days
optimization: my computer remained cool
bugs: the dummy may clip through walls and visual bugs may happen

rating: B

Happy Room is the best ‘torture simulator’ I have played in a while. This game is incredible and I love it very much so far. I think the only thing i want right now is for sandbox to be unlockable from the start as right now, it feels repetitive just to get access to sandbox. It has a very nice gameplay but has been brought down by the repetitive gameplay. I am hoping this will be improved and the community will grow. Want to find out what I think of this game?

Game is fun, until it decides that you haven't done anything. I was playing, i had almost killed the dummy, when the game removed all my progress. I had a good room saved, so I used that and returned to where I was, but I can't earn upgrade points or upgrade anything, or do missions. Wait until the game is fixed before buying.

Update, with spoilers: This game still has numerous bugs in it, such as sometimes not allowing me to do missions at all, or loading up without any of my unlocks (but I can still place any weapons because... why?). Basically, I still say that you should wait a few updates before buying, but if you are OK with a number of bugs then you probably will still enjoy it.",Not Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,2

""100%'d"" in about 3 hours. Art is charming and i didn't run into a single issue as far as bugs or coding or any of that goes.

Pikuniku is a charming little puzzle platformer that reminds me a bit of Locoroco. It lacks in content, But it makes up for it with co op gameplay, a funny story and a very coherent experience.

It has a little story, It is very short, The story should take you around 2 - 3 hours. but it is a good experience, The game is very coherent with all its elements, The soundtrack, graphics, gameplay, story. It all feels just right. You play as a little red monster with 2 legs, You mostly spend the game helping the npcs with their problems, There are also a few very basic side missions.

There is Local coop in special coop levels, You can also play Bassketball locally against eachother. The levels are pretty short, But it should fill up about an hour of co op gameplay, I think coop is pretty fun, but it could use a lot more levels with a lot more challenge in my opinion.

There are a bunch of challenge levels which have fast platforming or puzzles, But they are not hard. There are also a few bosses, But the game offers no real challenge, except for a single mini game. The game has a few missable trophies but these trophies stack between games, It also has a few missable achievements, But the game doesn't take very long

The game has a bunch of outfits which mostly have special abilities you need to progress in the game. There are also a bunch of secret areas which mostly are not very hard to spot. The game is funny in a childish way, It is very suitable for kids.

The graphics are pretty unique, It reminds me a bit of Locoroco, It is very childish It fits the style of the game well. The soundtrack also fits the game very well. The performance is great, The game is locked to 60fps, but it syncs to the display refresh rate if it is higher when you turn Vsync on.

Mostly you are looking for objects, solving puzzles or looking for ways to accomplish something. The game is a nice mix of gameplay, There are also a bunch of minigames that can be fun but frustrating, One achievements requires you to get a 999 score on a minigame, When I got to 600 and dropped the ball I was done.

Overall I can recommend the game, It is great for kids, But it is also a nice game to play if you are looking for a casual game with some simple puzzles. The co op is pretty cool too. I have to give it a 8, It is a good game, But it certainly lacks a bit in content for the price.

Pikuniku is essentially Capitalism for Babies in game format. I played the game alongside my 5 y.o. child who was able to enjoy the game with help reading out the dialogues and solving some of the harder puzzles and battles. Just like the characters in the Pikuniku universe, she started out being very excited about seeing Mr. Sunshine and the prospect of getting ""free money"", but gradually started to question his actions. The game became a helpful tool in explaining the impacts of rampant capitalism and overexploitation of resources. This was of course all possible by the virtue of the game's entertaining storyline and gags, enjoyable soundtrack, as well as endearing character designs. All this at an affordable price, to boot. Now that we have completed the game, we have also had fun playing the co-op stages together.",Recommended,49,0

PikuNiku is a bizarre adventure wrapped in an adorable aesthetic with some anti-capitalism glitter scattered on top. Given the silly nature of the game, I can almost guarantee that you will be entertained. However, perhaps more attention should have been spent on the gameplay as it is quite basic and has little replay value.
Side note: I still have no clue why the game is called PikuNiku (picnic in Japanese).

Played with Playstation 4 controller and my lovely partner

Positive:
PikuNiku emanates fun. The game immediately sets the tone by blasting you with an over-the-top slapstick cutscene, which is then followed by nonsensical events, silly characters, and countless bizarre encounters (battling giant toast, to name one). I never doubted that entertainment was the main focus of the game, from the wonky walk to ? soundtrack (don’t get me wrong, the soundtrack suits the game perfectly). Yet out of all the peculiarities, discovering the dancing insects was my favorite feature.

Neutral:
Only about 3 hours of gameplay for the singleplayer adventure. I personally find that slapstick humor doesn’t work more than once. If you know what's coming, suddenly the humor is lost. This happens to be the case with PikuNiku, rendering away any sort of replay value. This is further enforced by the lack of a chapter select option, mediocre minigames, and a limited endgame (discussed in further detail below).




PikuNiku is great… if you play it once and only once. Perhaps I’ve had enough of games rely too heavily on humor rather than gameplay. Overall it’s entertaining and worth several good chuckles but sadly is also littered with poor design choices that end up taking away from the experience. Would maybe recommend to younger audiences or anyone looking for something mindlessly humorous.",Recommended,38 people found this review helpful 1,3

I played the co-op section of this game. It’s short, only took us two hours to complete but my god, they were nearly the best two hours of my life.

Pikuniku is insane. I can not name a single other game that pulls so many new things and gimmicks out so randomly and so consistently. One second, you'll be playing hide and seek with a rock, the next thing you know you're fighting a demonic toast in his own hellish realm, then you're playing an aspiring game developer's new game, or giving a wizard a golden tooth of a silver frog in order to get your greatest wish, to just chilling on the beach. And the best part is, everything I listed here is not required in order to complete the game. Someone playing the game could just miss everything I listed here, just because they were cruising on through the story. If you got some free time and a little bit of spare change, pick up this game. Trust me, you won't regret it.",Recommended,24,0

I'm glad to have gotten this super cheap. I don't mind having played it, but I don't feel it's worth anywhere near full price.

It's one of those games that is so casual and so sparse it feels anemic, yet is long enough and polished enough that it's hard to judge as a toy or as an experiment when clearly it's a complete game that is just... lacking. I much prefer which is a fuller experience all around with a similar aesthetic and gameplay.

I’m going to do this one a little different because Pikuniku is a simple game and it only needs a simple review. It’s one of the cutest and funniest games I’ve ever played.

2020 really, really sucks, but man I have been very fortunate to play just so many incredible games this year, and Pikuniku is up there with the very best. Pikuniku has an easy to understand, well-paced, and fun story. It has lovable characters, even the antagonist. It has writing. Seriously. The visuals are nice. The platforming is simple, but fun, and there is even a little variety when it comes to gameplay. Music and sound effects are masterful, and for achievement hunters there is a challenge, as well as local co-op options (now accessible through Remote Play!).

Pikuniku’s only shortcoming is its sometimes floaty controls, which make a little bit of the platforming just a bit annoying. It’s also relatively short, but maybe this contributes to what a great, condensed experience this is, so this shortcoming is debatable

Haven’t laughed so hard playing a game since (which I was lucky enough to play this year), and before that ?????

I bought this game on release after watching Supermega play the co-op mode on their channel. The game is by no means a long one, but the content within is a joy to experience. The controls are intentionally a little slippery, but it adds to the charm in a way. You're given essentially free roam after completing a few objectives, and can explore the different areas at your leisure. The platforming and puzzles feel good, with the gauntlet segments offering a welcome bit of challenge to break up the flow of the game. These gauntlets are completely optional, and the frogs at each checkpoint can teleport you to the entrance if you end up wanting to leave early. The game also has several minigames that are a joy to play, one of which is available to play with two players instead of against an NPC. The story is presented in a way that I absolutely love seeing in games that offer the option to explore. The narrative is presented simply, and gives you an objective. However, there's no real pressure to accomplish these objectives in a timely manner. This changes, however, when you get into the final stretch of the game, where you're railroaded towards the final boss. One of my biggest pet peeves with games is when the story gives you an objective that you really should be focused on, but also tries to encourage exploration. A big example of this is Fallout 4. You emerge from the cryo chamber knowing your son is kidnapped. The story is presented in such a way that exploring feels morally wrong. Every moment you spend getting sidetracked is another moment that your son may be in danger. It takes away from the impact of the story and makes it feel more like a slog than an adventure.

I do, however, have a few minor problems with the game. The first of which, is that some of the controls are a bit unclear. Now, the core controls are very well explained, and it doesn't take long to get a hang of it. Mainly, I still don't know how to use items from my inventory. I have a postcard, but I don't know how to use it with the mailbox. Perhaps I haven't tried the right mailbox, but as it stands, this is still a mystery. Secondly, there are some areas that will require exiting out to the menu and reloading. The one that comes to mind is in the forest, where you can accidentally trap yourself in a hidden underground chamber by blocking up the entrance with acorns. You can't kick them in such a way that they roll all the way out, and the only other exit is to a smaller room that holds a trophy.

Overall, this game is wonderful and worth every penny of its modest $13. The controls feel good, despite some seldom frustrating platforming segments, the story is well-written and intriguing enough to keep the player moving forward, the world has many secrets to uncover that make exploring feel worth-while, the minigames are fun diversions that add more character to the world, the boss fights are varied and challenging, and the only problems I had were minor ones that honestly don't hold much of a bearing on the quality of the game.

I haven't had a chance to play the co-op levels yet, but this game has earned a place in my library as one of my favorite diversions.",Recommended,25 people found this review helpful 0,0

At first glance, it might look like a nice, little, and peculiar puzzle game inspired by Adventure Time and set in a somewhat dystopian narrative, but it masterfully manages to playfully explore some of the more serious themes like mindless consumerism and labor exploitation, climate change and accelerationism, AI and deep state conspiracy, while still offering such a joyful and fun experience in the end.

There are also plentiful of allegories and references hidden in the details, including, but not limited to: Brave New World, Beatles, Adventure Time, The Communist Manifesto, French Revolution, Nestle (the infamous bottled water controversy), ecology, anarchism, class consciousness, and entertainment consumption. I mean, the protagonist is literally an allegory to the ghost of Karl Marx, who—upon his awakening—sets on a journey to bring an end to capitalism.

I know, it might sound weird, but I think this is an example of when a game has a soul and developers clearly loved what they were doing. It left a very good impression on me, and I want to believe that developers themselves had a lot of fun while making this game.

what value do political beliefs hold?
should they always be shaped in favor of the people?
do you truly need to care for the people who care for you?
what could drive someone far-removed from struggle to seek liberation for the oppressed?
could you find it in yourself to care for your neighbor, if you each found yourself pressed under the same boot of corporate hierarchy?
and what of those who preceded us, whose beliefs are notorious yet lack a tangible presence in modern hegemony and an all-consuming capitalist system?

Pikuniku is a 2D casual game where you play as Piku, a red, wobble, clumsy little thing with a love for breaking stuff.

It is a short and simple game. Quite suitable for a lazy sunday afternoon. It is not much of a challenge. You can beat the game in a couple of hours and then waste some more looking for the hats you missed.
The game has a simple visual style that fits well with the silly story that moves the game forward. The whole story is packing with humor so dumb it gets kinda funny.

(I originally wrote this on release but decided to pick up the game for a dollar to post it here for everyone.)

It’s always nice to see a feel-good simple game out there in the world. Mario has been the bannerman of this sort of game for years and that’s nowhere more apparent than in Mario Odyssey. However, plenty of indie games have taken up the challenge to varying degrees of success, but today we’re looking at Pikuniku to see how they fair at creating the ‘accessible adventure’.

Accessible Adventure
My first impressions from this game coming off of Devolver Digital’s relentless advertising on twitter was that it wasn’t anything I’d be interested in. Nothing about the clips and gifs I saw looked like it would be relevant to my tastes. However, Devolver, in its infinite wisdom decided to give the game out to Twitch Prime members, further justifying my increasingly expensive subscription to Amazon. So I decided to give it a shot – besides, how often do you get a key to a game that isn’t even out yet without fighting for a review key?


My initial experience, that is, with the intro cutscene, was quite pleasant. The animation style and content had a bit of humor and it made me a lot more interested in the game than I had been initially. However, things began to fade a bit as the game started. The minimalist controls allowing basic movement, jumping, a kick, and the ability to turn into a ball and roll didn’t exactly provide the most alluring moveset. The ‘tutorial’ section included some simple use of these moves and the game started once again feeling like the sort of bland experience I expected from the trailer.


After setting out to the beginning of the game, things picked up a bit and I started to establish a feeling that persisted throughout my playthrough. The design of the characters and environment were a little familiar in the sense of feeling like they were from a modern children’s cartoon. Even the sounds and music, while certainly pleasant and catchy, were still reminding me of the same thing. Only the dialogue, much like in the intro cutscene, felt like it was designed to appeal to me. It wasn’t composed entirely of comedy, but the comedic beats from the animations and the rhythm of the words themselves lent itself to plenty of moments that made me smile.


The most engaging factor of Pikuniku is that it can make you feel good for even the smallest reasons. The movement of the characters on screen, the dialogue written for the key characters, the expressions they make with just their eyes, all serve to make for little moments of joy. There are even these random little places where a place on the ground has little ‘attention’ lines coming off of it and when you approach, you get to see a tiny cutscene of little bugs doing dances. I have no idea what purpose this serves outside of 10 seconds to make you feel good. I couldn’t help but make my way through this game with the singular desire to see what would be next up to put a smile on my face. While that all but disappeared after beating the fairly short game and roaming around for the remaining secondary quests, it played an unusually impactful part in making the game fun to play.


It’s hard to call Pikuniku fun in the traditional sense. The gameplay is not great. I’ve hardly even mentioned it up until this point because it’s comprised entirely of extremely basic platforming and puzzles with a few oddities and minigames throughout to make it a little more interesting. However, I played it all the way through because I was having fun doing it. I was enjoying the parts of the game that told a story with a few funny/silly parts and little moments that just made me happy. It has the same sort of quality that a game like Mario Odyssey has in that respect, but none of Mario’s enjoyable gameplay or areas where you can test and expand your skills.


If you want a game that challenges you, Pikuniku isn’t that even a tiny bit. If you want a game that will entertain you for a few hours with characters and designs that make you smile, then Pikuniku’s plenty of it. Is that worth $13? Well, that pretty subjective. I wouldn’t have bought this game at all given my feelings toward the marketing, but even knowing what I know now I still don’t know If I’d spend much on it. At the end of the day, I’d rather have a game with great gameplay and few interesting story beats or funny characters (with a few exceptions), but for what it is, Pikuniku is worth playing. I’ll leave it to you to decide what price you’d be willing to pay for that.

Never did I had the urge to review a game this bad. Worth every penny<333

I stumbled across this game randomly and it was one of the rare occasions where its simple visuals alone managed to get me to buy the game. I knew nothing of it, walked into it compleeetely blind and, I loved every second of it. It never gets super challenging, I really enjoyed most of the puzzles, lt has an amazing cutesy, a little bit of cynical charm, just overall great! Just moving, jumping around and turning into a tiny ball with Piku, the main character, brings a big fat smile to my face:) It was a really nice game to just fire up after a long day of stress. Super relaxing, just sit down, get yourself some water and enjoy your time.

My only issue is that the ending is, well I expected something grander I guess? But that's just me nitpicking at this point. It's a game where it's more about the journey than the end.

It's not a super long game, but still, with its fun multiplayer, a great game to buy for yourself and maybe for your friends:)!!",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 1,0

1. Why are there so many hidden, miss-able achievements? Makes you have to replay the whole thing if you miss one, and the replay value is nil.
2. The dancing king achievement. Absolutely horrible. Same with the stubborn (there are guides on how to get this one).
3. My main problem is that it's not actually a co-op game (which is why me and my friend bought it...). There is a co-op aspect and a few levels, but the main story/campaign is decidedly single-player! For shame...",Recommended,13 people found this review helpful 0,0

Pikuniku reminds me of flash games from the mid 2000's.
It's simple but it's just a fun little platformer that doesn't take things too seriously (Aside from kickball and dancing, those are serious)

You play as the sleeping beast that is Pikuniku as you platform your way through areas, play hide and seek with a rock and stop robots from taking all the corn.

Nothing revolutionary but overall it's light and simple fun.",Recommended,9,0

Pikuniku is a wonderfully charming game with a very simple story about the evils of capitalism. The gameplay is relatively simple yet fun to play (I think I spent like half an hour kicking everything and spinning into a ball as the mechanics was so fun).

Just completed it yesterday - it is a very simple and easy game to play. It is kid friendly, but can be appreciated and enjoyed by adults too.

I think I paid like £10 for this game, and normally I would advise against paying that kind of money for something so short, but there is a lot of polish in the gameplay and presentation, and it's just super charming. And with that said, there is even more to explore.

I would say that it is kind of worth it for £10, but definitely worth it at a 25%+ discount.",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 0,0

In this game, you can solve most problems by kicking somebody's a-r-s-e. 10/10 will play again and do the same in the real life.

Now, seriously:
Pros:
+ Everything is so cute: the animation, the music, the characters, etc.
+ Easy-listening soundtrack.
+ Amusing dialogues.
+ Casual, family-friendly, joyful, and funny gameplay, with light platforming and puzzle elements.
+ Childish but intriguing plot with implicit anti-capitalism & environmentalism moral.
+ Has local co-op levels (at least one controller is required). Although the main story (Adventure mode) is single-player only, it is still extremely enjoyable to play with your family.
+ The whole game is short and focused. Takes me 8 hours to 100% the game at a slow pace.

Cons:
- Has missable achievements. Completionists should refer to this wonderful guide:
Pikuniku All Achievements guide! 
A Guide for Pikuniku
By: Blinky

- Maybe a bit too short for its full price.

Verdict:
I fully recommend this game, especially to players that are into cute/funny/short/casual games.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

Going into this game I expected something short and sweet, like cotton candy, but having finished it I feel like a just ate a wad of plain old cotton.

What was nice
The art style is nice - the kind of simple stuff that is easy to create and make motions for but is still hard to disagree with visually.
I appreciate what went into the programming. I didn't encounter any bugs and despite the physics system the individual characters have a knack for retaining their function no matter what you do to them. You can really mess with the characters a lot and they can still talk and move in a cutscene without breaking.
What was okay
The music complements the art direction in its simplicity but unlike the visuals, it gets grating after a while listening to the same track if you stick in one area for too long.
The story serves the purpose of moving you from A to B and, like many things in this game, is completely forgettable. Then again, I expected a ditzy story for a game like this, so I wasn't really let down here.
The dialogue tries to be funny and it is hit-or-miss; mostly miss. I recognized some internet memes mixed in, so if that's your thing, have at it.
What wasn't nice
There are three types of things-to-do in this game:


Where I wasn't expecting in interesting story or dialogue, I was expecting fun gameplay. Not particularly difficult or intensive, but a gameplay loop that feels nice to do. Unfortunately, what could have been an enjoyable movement and physics system isn't realized. Some games that lack in gameplay can still keep your interest by pushing you forward in other ways, like an interesting story or visuals. In the end, I kept playing hoping for something fun to come, but I was let down.

I bought the game for $0.99 on sale and a cheaper-than-cotton-candy price seems about right for it. After all, this game is rated pretty highly, so I'm sure a lot of people will have a different experience than I did. I guess what I'm saying is, don't worry about buying cotton candy for next to nothing on sale, and also don't worry about throwing away that cotton candy early on if you don't like it since it isn't going to taste any better three hours in.",Not Recommended,23 people found this review helpful 1,5

i didn't expect you to get this far, honestly
Pikuniku is an adorable story about a little red creature who escapes a cave and ends up overthrowing that nasty old societal structure, capitalism. It does this through very simple platforming gameplay - your main offensive manoeuvre is a swift kick and you can roll and jump and hook onto hooks and do dance battles against the robots, and paint scarecrows, and play hide and seek, and break pottery, and so much other cool stuff. If you see this on sale, jump at it!
A really cool experience, and great for all ages. It reminds me a lot of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee but nowhere near as dark. It also has local co-op! All in all, one of the best little games I ever stumbled across. Very pleased to find it and to be able to share it. It is always important to share and recommend games like this - they are infinitely better than the copy / paste FPS games or TPS games that the industry likes to spit out. Reward creativity and passion!

Too short for good value at full price, otherwise do get (on sale).

I really liked this game, it reminded me a lot of an online game I used to play, Poptropica. A lot of walking and jumping around, not much skill required of the player since it was mostly dialogue in a cutesy humorous style.

I do have complaints, like the singleplayer story being so short that somebody taking their time 100%ing all collectibles could still finish the game in under 5 hours, or there being no option to play the story in co-op (the titular character Niku is only even available in the co-op levels! Of which there are 9) so the game is actually more ""Piku"" than ""PikuNiku"". The short length may be why the developers chose to make some achievements require restarting the game if you missed them the first time around without completing them flawlessly (like the dancing achievement, a couple of trophies, and one of the dancing bugs). Not a fan of them trolling players by putting a postcard and mailbox in the game when we don't even get to mail it to our friend who asked for one at the beginning of the game.

I did enjoy the time I spent with this game (the playtime shown might seem inflated from running it several times), and none of my complaints were enough to stop playing, they just made me a little upset.",Recommended,11 people found this review helpful 0,0

Honestly, I think the experience of playing this game was mostly enjoyable. It's not difficult, but who said games need to be difficult to be fun? I suppose there are worse ways to spend an evening, especially for its current sale price of $0.99. 3-5 hours of gameplay for that buck is a decent return on your investment.

So... why am I not recommending this?

Because the designers felt that it was ok to introduce a character (the ghost) who asks you at the very beginning of the game to send it a postcard during your adventures. During your adventure, you find a postcard item. You also see several post boxes throughout your travels. And yet... you cannot mail your postcard.

This doesn't even qualify as Bad Game Design. This is straight up lazy, petty trolling from the developers and I hate it and it left a bad taste in my mouth. For a game with as much endearing, engaging character as this one to drop that ball -- that HARD -- ... ugh. I'm getting too old for this ish. Call this review petty if you like.

It's cute, but not much else beyond that. I found myself waiting for the real challenge to begin and suddenly the game was over. What Pikuniku tries to pass off as platforming puzzles are really just timesinks. Only once did I not immediately figure out what to do.

That being said, me and a friend had alot of fun playing the co-op mode. Be aware, however, that there are very few co-op levels, and a couple of them are very short. I also suspect that us having fun relied almost completely on my friend being alot less experienced with video games, causing us to fail in hilarious ways.

Here's a recipe for Beef Wellington:

Ingredients:
- 1 (2-pound) beef tenderloin
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1/2 pound mushrooms, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped shallots
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1/4 cup beef broth
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Season the beef tenderloin with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the beef and sear on all sides until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and let cool.
4. Spread the Dijon mustard over the cooled beef tenderloin.
5. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic and cook until the mushrooms are browned and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
6. Add the white wine, beef broth, and thyme to the skillet and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
7. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mushroom mixture cool.
8. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
9. Spread the mushroom mixture over the puff pastry.
10. Place the beef tenderloin on top of the mushroom mixture.
11. Wrap the puff pastry around the beef tenderloin, making sure to seal the edges.
12. Brush the beaten egg over the top of the puff pastry.
13. Place the Beef Wellington on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and the beef tenderloin is cooked to your liking.
14. Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

I really don't know what to feel about this game. I played it with very little sleep and it kinda felt like I was on lsd but not. It's an extremely artistic game that provides a great change of pace to the shooter battle royal market we currently live in but at the same time, is the creator ok? I am genuinely confused on how anyone can make this up and be ok. It's so chill but also crazy. I think I need some sleep after this.

Solid 10/10 game.",Recommended,13,0

First of all, before you think I am hating on the game let me tell you that I find it not that bad, it has its moments, a nice story and is kind of cute and silly overall. However, my complaint with this game is that besides what I described of it, there's not that much to the game: sure, it contains nice puzzles but they are overcomed with little to no effort when it isn't for the sometimes clunky movement, which would have been a plus to the game if the devs fixed it a little. Granted, it's supposed to be a feature of the game but that doesn't change the fact that it can become quickly annoying to play. Also like I said earlier the story is nice and cute and the characters too but you'll get used with it eventually and it'll make the game rather shallow at the end. Eventually there are secrets to collect and multiplayer levels to play but those don't really last long.

At the end of the day, you got yourself a 10$ game with a 7h playtime, that time being easily forgettable since the game doesn't leave you, or at least me, with much impressions anyway. I think it's safe to say Piku Niku is more looks than anything else and a hollow game.",Not Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

This game was an absolute joy to play through. Anybody who didn’t grab it during the recent sale really missed out. I can understand how some people may initially be put off by it’s cutesy, childlike appearance. Rest assured, this is a wonderful little indie gem that I will definitely be revisiting in the future. While I do wish it were a little longer, this game still was immensely satisfying.

Pikuniku is a charming and quirky adventure that takes you to a colorful world full of surprises and secrets. You play as Piku, a red blob with legs, who has to help the villagers fight against the greedy Mr. Sunshine and his robots. You meet many quirky characters, solve puzzles, collect hats, and play mini-games. The game is simple to play, humorous and cheerful.

If you’re looking for a game that will brighten your day, look no further than Pikuniku. I give it 9/10 UwUs.",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,0

Absolutely AMAZING game, i originally got it for free on epic games (treason i know) but i loved it so i bought it on steam and i played it again for the 3rd time. im currently trying to get 100% but i just wanna say this game is amazing and for the price everyone should play it.
Graphics are super good and work really well in this game.
its not really that hard unless you go for certain achievements (looking at you mr ""The Stubborn"")
its got a lot of content and theres really something for everyone, wanna goof around in a cute funny game with leaf looking people, its got it, wanna kill a bunch of robots? its got it. want some pretty good platforming? its got it.
this game is unbelievably fun and super hilarious and stands still as one of my top 3 favorite games ever.
have not really tried the CO-OP yet but i hear its good.

Physics-based puzzle-platformer - has short singleplayer campaign & 9 levels for local coop. Played on xbox controllers with a kiddo - we almost finished all 9 levels in 2 hours... the game's RLY overpriced, but it's a RLY good sandbox too - cool interactivity to every object, nice pleasant character dynamics - it was honestly very fun just to fool around (puzzles got magically solved with little effort).",Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 0,0

Short but fun
Some may find the comedy very mediocre and lazy

+Tons of exploration
+Physics engine makes the animations very spastic
+Very chill with low stakes
+swinging and rolling
+really fun dungeons

-way too easy, the only challenge is in dungeons
-rolling could've been more fluid and enjoyable, but the game halts your momentum once you expand your legs, limiting the move potential to shorthops and sprinting
-not too much challenge in the platforming other then dealing with the physics engine
-due to physics engine, some puzzles are wonky and require multiple attempts
-certain trophies and achievements require you to restart THE ENTIRE GAME if you miss them the first time around
-coop is local only. If you don't have a friend, 2 controllers are recommended
-even with 100% completion it's short",Recommended,7,0

A fun game to play with friends. I recommend it. While you're here, Please enjoy this pie recipe:
Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 brown sugar
4. 1/2 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples -peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double crust pie
Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F ( 220 degrees C )
2. Combine butter , white sugar ,brown sugar, water , cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside
3- Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices
4. Roll out top crust into 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 ( 1-inch ) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie,coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C ) and bake until the crust is golden brown , the caramel on the top is set and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing",Recommended,424,0

Remember that time a long time ago when stickman fighting videos were the hottest thing. For the first time ever you can be a part of one. Every animation, weapon and map have incredible physics which looks like it has been carefully animated by a professional animator, when in reality it's just really good looking physics/physics-based animation. The many weapons are very fun and different and will have you accidentally kill yourself. The guns have extremely over exaggerated recoil giving them that cartoony feel. The gameplay is very fast and the map design is clever (making it very easy to trap-kill your opponents). The gameplay is endless and the loadingtimes are non-existent so be prepared to forget about time.

A thing to note is that this game is best played locally with atleast 1-3 friends. The game has an online feature, but since everything in the game is physics-based, the online gameplay will be less fluid and have occasional bugs.

To summarize, Stick Fight is an incredible game because of the physics-animations, powerful and silly weapons, clever map design and overall flow. Tho the game might not be for you if you want more than endless fighing your friends. Stick Fight is a game I've been waiting for for years without even knowing I needed it. It's an instant classic.",Recommended,140,3

Honestly after a few games and trying only a few of the many weapons out. I have now unlocked the amazing ability to understand why Indiana Jones dreaded snakes. I successfully managed to gain Ophidiophobia (take a guess at what that fear is about) after someone acquired the the Snake Rocket Launcher. yet somehow i manage to always find myself only with a pistol.
Now this game really stands out if you have friends to play it with. Honestly even with randoms it's still a blast either way.
Pros:
-The game is fairly cheap. During sales, the cost is much lower. (Shocking I know)
-Can be very entertaining due to it's RNG-like gameplay
-The game is very simple to learn.
-The weapons are very unique. Often ranging from regular pistols, to snake grenade launchers.
-Gave me ophidiophobia
-The maps can be very bizarre and at other times very simple
-The cartoon feeling fits well with the gameplay
-Can support up to 4 players per game
-Split-screen works well
-Snakes.
-The moments where you say something like, ""I GOT BESTED BY A CRIPPLED GUY WITH A JAVELIN""
-The games are often very quick, and you don't need to wait too long.
-You catch on the key mechanics of the game, within 15 minutes
-Any weapon that involve snakes.

-""Is that a Snake I shot out of this minigun?""
-""Oh I can shoot them out forever!""
-""WAIT WHY ARE THEY ATTACKING ME""
-""BAD SNAKES, I AM YOUR LORD""
-
-I have never screamed more in my entire life.

Every game has some flaws and this is no exception.
-Bugs are sometimes frequent, but they don't cause too many issues.
-There is no training mode.
-The map making system needs more stuff.
-The player who gets a weapon first, will often be the winner. So the winner comes down to that practically
-Repetitive
-It's quite fun indeed. But you'll need friends for it to last

Overall this is a great game, that I have honestly haven't been able to play much. I would rate it an 8/10.",Recommended,141,12

Let me get one thing straight, I am not giving this game a bad review because it is a bad game. For couch play or just playing online with your friends? Really fun. Online with random people can still be really fun. But something I run into really often is hackers. It happens really often and is annoying. So if you are buying the game to play with friends, get it because it is just a blast with friends. But if you are just getting it to play online with people you don't know, just take caution.

I finally did it. I out pizza'd the Hut. It was the greatest mistake of my life.

After years of perfecting my recipe, I made my way down to the local hut, fresh-baked pizza pie in hand. ""Try this,"" I told the kid working the counter. He did, and he had to agree that it was better than anything Pizza Hut had to offer. Soon, the entire store, customers included, was feasting on my delicious pie. The manager walked over, grabbed a slice, and took a bite. I look at him, anticipation rising. This was the boss, the local fief lord of the Hut. His approval meant more to me than all the rest combined. He took a bite and nodded. ""I'll be damned,"" he said, ""you really did it. You out- pizza'd the Hut. Shame."" Shame? What did he mean by tha-- the manager pulled a gun out from behind his apron and shot the nearest customer in the head. ""We have a Code Jalapeño,"" he said into his wrist as he executed the remaining customers. ""I repeat, we have a Code Jalapeño."" The ground was slick with blood. The kid working the counter choked out his dying breath as the manager turned to me. ""You just had to do it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You just had to out pizza the Hut."" He shoved the gun in my face. I was too scared to fight, too scared to run. The manager pulled the trigger.

A click. The gun was empty. I threw a chair at the manager and scrambled out of the Pizza Hut, not even bothering to see if my missile hit its mark. I was closely pursued by the manager, who had gotten his hands on a deadly sharp pizza cutter. I suspected in his hands it would cut more than pizza. Somehow, I was able to get into my car and speed off, the manager cursing my existence as I left him behind. I took a deep breath. The manager was clearly psychotic. Yes, that was it, just a crazy man with a gun. It had to be. My phone rang. Sister. I picked it. ""They're dead, she sobbed. They're all dead. Mom, Dad, Chris, Bill. Dead. They killed them all."" I could barely understand her, so great were her sobs. ""What do you mean? Where are you?"" I asked urgently. ""How is this possi--"" A single gunshot sounded through my phone's speakers. Silence. Then, I heard a man's voice. ""No one out pizzas the Hut."" He hung up. I drove down the empty country road, mind blank. I had nothing. They killed my family. I was alone.

At that moment I knew what I had to do. They took everything from me. Well then, I would take everything from them. Pizza Hut was so terrified of being out pizza'd, they forgot there's one thing worse than a man with a recipe: A man with nothing to lose. I'll give them a limited time offer they won't be able to refuse: two bullets for the price of one.

Edit: Level editor and Steam Workshop are now available. More weapons and levels have also been added since release.

I bought this game simply because it reminded me of those old stick man fighting animation videos on YouTube. So far, the gameplay is similar to Duck Game, where you jump around killing your friends with whatever you can get your hands on. The concept is amazing and leaves a lot of replayability due to the mass amount of levels and weapons. The demo video above is a very accurate representation of how the game plays, and is 100% worth it for the price listed. I've only played with my friends online, but for the people without friends, there was the option to play online with randoms. There's also local multiplayer for those people looking to have some social ""IRL"" interaction. Hopefully we get some more levels and weapons in the future or some Steam Workshop integration for the posibility to create our own levels.",Recommended,103,0

7.5/10

Simple yet charming, Stick Fight is such a casual game. There is no complex game system and complicated content, the player in the game to do very simple things, quickly get started and then you can carry out in the game to fight. At this point, this work is undoubtedly done quite perfectly.

Its shortcomings are also very obvious, due to the very easy to get started, lack of substance of the gameplay, and monotonous mode, players will easily get bored after a long time playing. The game system does have some unreasonable design, the absurd way of fighting in addition to the technology also makes the luck to a certain extent will be the winner, which will inevitably make players lose the game in the accident, but fortunately, the overall pace is fast, will not leave too much frustration to the players.

As a game to relieve stress during leisure time, Stick Fight is certainly very good, and even now, it still has a certain number of online players, so players can play anytime and anywhere, whether it is a local match or online multiplayer. The pursuit of casual gaming experience and stress relief is not to be missed by players.",Recommended,112,6

It was an afternoon like any other, I bought a $5 game as to put off my boredom for Summer Break. Little did I know that game was far deeper than my prejudice led me to believe. The march to 1000 hours took a year of daily playing, and every day I would get a little better. I was not particularly good, nor did ever intend to be where I am right now. With every day I learned something about the players, something about attacks, strategies, and combos, something about bugs, latency, and mods; something about maps, art, and guides. Although, many recognize my ability, it's not smirk's, prob not even Rank X, but I'm not a noobie either. It's a strange feeling to have certain play styles built into muscle memory, to know each and every map, to know the names of each and every weapon, and to know what each player is likely to do. Many places where I go contain the word ""Kilonovae."" This has far more meaning than what it appears to mean. Using the letter-base of Kaitahuri and Kilonovae, choosing the longest words you can make, the words ""revaluation"" and ""variational"" appear. This game has ""Something different from another of the same type"" and caused me to have ""A reassessment of the value or worth of something."" Many dislike the repetitive nature of the game, many dislike it's frequent bugs, and many dislike the occasional mod users, but I don't see it like that, I appreciate the more fundamental parts of this game and the growth it induces. Lastly, ""Kaitahuri"" has meaning as well, Kaitahuri is Maori for ""Converter,"" one who converts others not in the religious aspect but the mental one. To change your way of thinking the way this game changed mine. Thanks devs ^_^

Sincerely,

Kaitahuri",Recommended,119,12

Remember when stick figure fight animations were the best thing on YouTube?

Now they're the best thing on Steam.

Fast-paced and fabulous, and an excellent time killer. Watch out for bugs though. Odds are others are going to see something completely different than you do. Granted, it can add to the experience, but maybe don't play it with someone who gets frustrated easily.

At this point, the game is just a nice little ""time waster"", in the good way, of course. Since there's pretty much no goal in the game than just join or host a game and start punching sticks around, it can become boring quickly. But i'm sure if the devs play their cards right and keep expanding the game, it will be something even better!

-Quick Review-
Have you ever seen that classic youtube video ""Animator vs. Animation""? (I highly recommend it), I like to think this game was inspired by it.
Stick Fight: The Game is a multiplayer cluster muck, where you assume control over a stick figure and then battle against your friends are rando's in a gladiator-style arena. Stick Fight was developed by Landfall and released Sep 28, 2017.

-Detailed breakdown review-
Gameplay: My brother found a multiplayer-indie-game-bundle, and we all grabbed bundles! You can play with random people to just experience the game. but nothing quite compares with screaming and yelling over voice chat while playing with friends/siblings.

There's a plethora of unique maps and weapons. With the addition of player made content there's more than a fair share of stuff to keep people's attention. The last standing survivor gets a crown which basically provokes the rest of us to want to kill you for being special.

As a bit of a heads up, there is a chatting feature, soooooo sometimes unsupervisored children get onto the game, but you END THEM in this game, and feel really good about yourself as they drop the caps lock.

Maybe I'm not very good, but I don't know that there's really a fool-proof strategy to playing Stick Fight. I played dead a few times, that worked well. I fired slow concentrated fire once, that worked well, I danced and shot to the beat of the music... that worked well.
And I've also been on a losing spree so bad I just quit playing for the day. Again... I really only see this as a fun chaotic game to play with friends over voice chat. For me, this was totally worth picking it up!",Recommended,62,2

If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",Recommended,214,0

Well, I found this game kind of randomly. I think I saw the trailer for it because I had the april fools day Totally Accurate Battle Zombilator or something like that. And, I'm gonna rate it just like all of my other reviews! 1 to 10 scale!

Graphics: 9/10: The graphics in this game are crisp and smooth. Though, explosions aren't quite optimized, and i'd love to see some sort of extra distinguishing marks like maybe hats or something similar added later. And certainly a Colorblind Mode for those gamers who can't see certain colors!

Audio: 10/10: The Music and Sounds for this game are a mix of funky techno and awesome gunshot noises. Though I'd have loved to hear an AWP noise from CS:GO for the Sniper Rifle.

Gameplay: 9.5/10: I will certainly get hundreds of hours out of this with friends. The gameplay is like an older PS3 game a friend had where you could Twin Stick and you had a Punch, Kick, and Energy button setup. And there were random weapons that would spawn. I would like the ability to go into a Training Room with each of the weapons to learn how they play, and some sort of Health Meter would be nice, but not required.

Maps: 9/10: The maps are great and fun to play, But i'd love to see some sort of Map Creator linked to the Steam Workshop Mods system. This would help to keep the game alive unlike other similar and still fun Indie titles like Screencheat, where the game is great, but the small map pool killed the game's potential to purely a few hours and then moving on with my life.

Overall: 9/10: People might say that I am being harsh on a brand new Indie title, but these are valid criticisms, and I do only have a few minutes into the game at the time of this review, but I will certainly be racking up the hours as the weeks go by and I need something to put my frustrations into! I highly recommend this game as a fun Party game. Controllers are required and I highly recommend learning how to use the Twin Stick fighting style!",Recommended,92,11

So today I played stickfight with 2 friends, it was going pretty well and I was hosting. Then a random joined and my friends started talking trash but we were having fun. Eventually the random says which state I live in and figured that he had somehow grabbed one of our IP addresses because we all lived in the same state and he was just trying to be intimidating. So after a few more minutes of playing he goes AFK but we keep playing. Shortly after my wifi completely goes down. Long story short, I got DDoS attacked over stick fight.

Miss the good old online flash games? Were you a fan of stickdeath (green vs blue)? Did you miss the simple, but well done effects that flash used to provide? Stick Fight : The Game will bring you back to the late 90's or early 00's where everything was a party.

Stick Fight's gameplay is quite simple and effective in its delivery. What you see is literally what you will get, an action packed game in which will force you to move. The objective of Stick Fight is to be the last survivor on the map. To eliminate enemy players, opposing players must push enemies to the edge of the map or deplete their HP. HP can be depleted by recieving melee blows or ""bullets"" from weapons. Options regarding weapon drops, map selection and HP amount can all be modified easily, quickly and efficiently through the in-game menu. The movement of the characters are quite fluid and it seems their body position can play a big role in delivering damage (especially if you have no gun)! The body physics do move accordingly and hands and feet will get caught on edges if you move carelessly. The guns are quite diverse and come in all shapes and sizes. The regular weapons are all there from swords, pistols, machine guns to rocket launchers, but the devs added a bit of spice to the mix. Imagine a rocket launcher or a shotgun that shoots out snakes that chase you down. Now imagine a giant flame thrower burning up parts of the map. The variety of guns with the option to jump/dodge/melee adds some more depth to the gameplay. The maps were creatively and well done. I definitely like how some maps will give you open space to work with, while other maps will force you to use whatever land you have left to stay alive! Some maps will include explosive materials, land deformation capabilities and explosive materials containing snakes.

The are simplistic. They do not, however, not take away from the game. If anything, it allows the players to focus in on the gameplay and enjoy the diversity of the maps. The maps do follow a theme, but are very different stage to stage. Maps can also be randomized or specifically picked by theme (just incase you get tired of barrels with snakes blowing up). I really like how they did the body physics movement as players can try to raise an arm/gun over cover to fire. The are okay. I feel this domain could have been done a little bit better. I feel when players got hit or collided with objects, there should have been a little bit more emphasis and immersion with the sounds/effects. They did do a good job for the halloween themed levels. They mixed up not only the gameplay, but the music and sounds when one player turns into a pumpkin. Don't worry, just because you turn into a pumpkin doesn't mean your game is over... it just means you can fly and use a variety of attacks regular players can't use!

Overall, a pretty good game if you have some good friends to play with. You should know that SINGLE PLAYER IS NOT AN OPTION! Either play local or go online... no soup for you if you want to play by yourself. This is where adding AI's into the game would have been great, but no such feature exists (yet hopefully). Game is definitely worth it on sale.

Pros:
The huge quantity of weapons make it so you don't get bored of the same weapon.
The game can run on even the worst PCs.
The game is very cheap.
The game has a destructible landscape which is very fun to destroy.
The game's physics are really fun to play with.

Cons:
The game has many glitches. (map disappearing, not dying, etc)
Someone of the maps are quite boring because they only give you one type of gun.
Really salty community. (idk if everyone has salty players, but usually mine are.)
There is only a maximum of 4 players.
Some guns are ridiculously OP.

Requests:
Add more than 4 players maximum.
Fix bugs where the map disappears.
Maybe make the better guns rarer.
Possibly add accessories rather than just sticking to color.",Recommended,66,0

Stick Fight is diverse, funny and challenging - in a beginner friendly way. Great when together in front of a tv, but still pretty good in online mode.

Pros:

+ great amount of maps
+ very good controls

(I am adding spoilers to this because, why not)

This is a really fun game. Nothing really much to go past, no story, no title screen, just getting to the point, and that makes it instant for what it is.

And then comes the gameplay, it is average right now, it really just matters how good your PC is at handling somethings, like These weapons spawn

Also, I would say, this is probably the best game I have ever played where I had some much fun playing on the keyboard instead of the controller. I know, I know, most people like the controller more than the keyboard, but damn, this is just too much for me. Good job devs, I don't really like using the keyboard for most games, but this one.

Another one is the graphics, even if some of them are just flat colors, everything makes itself look beautiful, maybe because the graphics are supposed to go with the stick figure concept, simple and not detailed. (Yet they plan it out to be anyways, and I can't argue with that)

Last thing, I don't like about this game for how crunchy each transitions are, I know they use a random phrase each time there is one, but sometimes a random thing just spawns with it. Sometimes the level just doesn't load and I lose instantly, and most of which the level is either messed up or spawned with another level. These things rarely happen so this doesn't really get on my nerves that much, aside the fact that this is something that makes the game random and funny.

It may spawn some spammers and tryhards to your game so look out for those people, and this might get people a little bit too competitive, so I wouldn't recommend this for people who aren't into unfairingly placed situatuations and people who don't like competitive games in general.

Bad:
- You need friends to play
- Only probably going to play about an hour or two before you want to play something else
- Can be glitchy and laggy but nobody really cares
- You can play through every single level in less than an hour

Gameplay: (Terrible) (Very Bad) (Bad) (Okay) (Good) (Very Good) (Amazing)

""Why aren't you movin… Ohhh, that’s a snake, RIP.""
- Blue stick man

💻 Description:
Stick Fight is a multiplayer arena brawler that pays homage to the memorable stick videos we all grew up watching. It is a game where prejudice against an entire colour feels natural, as most of the time you will be screaming your lungs out because of that random blue guy that led to your demise. The ultimate arena of slaughter offers a good selection of maps, odd weapons, and ragdoll physics that, when combined, provide endless hours of fun and frustration.

The stickman genre began in the early 2000s, when sites like Albino Blacksheep and YouTube were thriving. Since then, many stick man animations and games have been introduced in the market; however, few of them managed to capture the charming quirkiness that has made stick man such a popular idea in the gaming world. The creators of Landfall West took the initial step toward bringing this genre back by introducing an open arena in 2016, where the objective is to create massive havoc and beat the crap out of your friends. Whether you want to become a master in the arts of snake rocket launching or just practice your Shaolin skills, that is up to you.

Like I mentioned before, the main objective of the game is to devastate your opponents by either using fists, random weapons, or your own stupidity. Every so often, the game summary is presented on top of the screen, naming the players with the most and the least number of kills. Prove that your colour is superior to the others by gathering random sticks from all around the world or engaging in competition with your friends and family.

Stick Fight features spikes, black holes, laser beans, various parkour challenges, and many other shenanigans. There are more than a hundred levels spread across ten different settings, each with a unique theme, that provide countless possibilities to ruin the day of your beloved friends. By employing explosives or incredible firepower, you can even destroy platforms and alter the environment to your liking. After each session, the map quickly switches to another setup and thus the chaos ensues once more, giving you little time to prepare yourself. Allow your imagination to run wild, as dungeons, sneak pits, and many other shenanigans await.

The control scheme in Stick Fight is very simple. You can wall jump, kick, and perform blocks that will shield you from upcoming blows. You can also grab javelins and even throw projectiles in any direction. Fighting makes extensive use of physics, resulting in many interesting interactions, but what about the weapons? Every arena drops guns randomly from the sky in different places. The decent weapon variety includes shotguns, pistols, and rocket launchers, as well as unique models that can even destroy a massive part of the arena. For instance, the black hole gun can suck everything in its vicinity, putting the environment out of balance and creating hilarious scenarios. When used properly, weapons provide a significant advantage. Some firearms have powerful impacts that can knock you off a platform, while others could potentially backfire. Overall, each session has a unique outcome, and even if you are the most skilled player in the game, a random blue stick will always kill you with a 360 no scope.

Finding players online is always an option if you can't assemble the squad. You can also customise your own arenas by choosing fewer weapons and settings for your upcoming sessions in accordance with your favourite playstyles. Unfortunately, since the game is physics-based, the online experience will be less fluid and hence less enjoyable, mostly due to lag issues. There were multiple times when I was throwing a shot, and the aftermath of the explosion became visible two seconds after the impact. Such unfortunate events have more than once led me to throw my controller out the window. Nevertheless, the player base is still active, providing multiple fun sessions to this day.

The cartoonish environmental visuals are pleasing to the eye, especially the particle effects, as they make the impact of the explosions noticeable. On top of that, the engrossing setting seamlessly integrates with the game's physics mechanics, leading to fast-paced terrain changes that don’t impact the overall performance. The map design nicely matches the background theme, the animations are fluid, and the weaponry can be easily distinguished. With its explosive pumpkins, vampires, and other additions that made the overall experience unique, the Halloween level left the strongest impression on me and demonstrated the wide variation in level design.

The funky techno background music fit in perfectly with the mix, transitioning to different styles as the arena's many environments changed. The weapon sounds are clear, and the executions feel peachy due to the small yet impactful clang that can be heard after each hit. Last but not least, for such a simple game, I was impressed by the amount of effort put into each track, ranging from boss intros to Halloween themes and more.

All in all, Stick Fight is an casual brawler with simple concepts integrated into a strange but intriguing setting. Considering the price you pay, I undeniably recommend this game. Grab some popcorn, slap your friends in the ass, and call them different slurs solely based on their stick colour without any consequences. In Stick Fight, there are no rules, only mayhem!",Recommended,54,2

I only bought this to play with my friends, I don't think randoms would be as fun because usually we're on Discord.
I'm not a person who plays a lot of fighting games (especially combo based ones, I struggle with those eg Brawlhalla, Tekken, Mortal Kombat etc)

PROS:
1) This is physics based with animations generated procedurally. What that means is that funny things will happen to your characters, and you could destroy some parts of maps which results in hilarity. Also, weapons like shotguns and rocket launchers have recoil that throw your character into the air like a paper, so you could do some insanely funny things(sawed off jumps anyone?)
2) It's cheap. For the amount of laughs and fun this game gives you, it's a bargain.
3) It has LOCAL MP! That means, if you find a big TV or screen at a LAN party and have some friends, hook it up and play. Great for couch gaming too if you have a setup for it.
4) Supports the DualShock 4 controller without need of DS4Windows, which is always a good sign for me.
5) Up to 4 player support (a CON too but that's listed below)
6) Vanilla maps are so much fun to play on but some maps can be boring to play on.
7) The game implements a boss fight feature, so fight to take control of the boss and destroy your friends!
8) It's relatively easy to get in to, even people who don't game much can easily play this.
9) Steam Workshop support means you can download hundreds of maps to keep the game interesting.


CONS (I really struggled to come up with them, most of my memories of this game involve hysterical laughter and screaming)

1) Only supports 4 players. I wish it would support 6 or 8 but due to the map design it would be too chaotic.
2) It can get boring if you play with randoms and don't have any form of voice communications to hear each other laugh their heads off
3)Sometimes weird glitches and spawns happen, such as spawning outside the map and instantly dying but that's just once in a while bad luck (though it DOES occur)

NEUTRAL
1) It uses a Peer To Peer system (I think, I'm no expert in this!) so playing with people outside your region can give latency issues.
2) I'm not a fan of the sound track but then again I usually don't like video game soundtracks that often anyway.

All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a local multiplayer game or something to play with friends online. From personal experience, it's amazing at LAN parties because of just how chilled out it is. 8/10 in my opinion",Recommended,36,14

The game is quite unique in terms of tech that can be found in it.
Blocking and striking at the same time propels you forward at intense speed, you can throw a gun only to pick it back up again to gain an extra jump, parry and much else I just don't remember.

However. The hitboxes are dubious at best. For both the character and weapons. I bet the characters are either server-side or client-side in a way where they often appear displaced.

Can't say the same for weapon hitboxes though. Often when you throw your weapons, if the hitbox so much as graces a pixel, it'll lose it's powerful throwing property but more often than not, the velocity is retained... This has led to, shall I say Unfortunate losses where I've thrown a weapon only for it to be picked up by the enemy...

Man I just want to style on my opponents with the instant kill pistol throw headshot consistently!

A couple of friends and I decide to pick this game up after browsing around for another multiplayer game. Found this little gem for only $5 bucks and WOW what a fun time. This game is great if you and your friends are easily excited and big Sh*t talkers.

The game is Incredibly Fast Paced, a single match can sometimes last less then 15 second, and simple in its control's as there are your basic WASD for movement with right and left mouse click being attack and block. All weapons have there own unique characteristics.

The game-play is smooth, the music is bumping and the level theme's all provide a different experience.
The only Con with this game is due to it's fast pace the levels pass fairly quickly and you start repeating level's, leaving you wanting more.

Pick it up 9/10!

message to Dev: If you come out with a map pack for $2, my friends and I will gladly pick it up.",Recommended,27 people found this review helpful 0,0

tl;dr at bottom

EDIT: Many of the bugs referenced in this review have already been fixed by active developers, and it's already easier to find a game.

Overview

Remember 2008? Obama had just been elected, Breaking Benjamin were on tour, and every other YouTube video was a stick fight animation using their music. If you don't remember, proceed with caution- you may just cut yourself on all of that edge. For a safer (and arguably more fun) physics based experience, play Stick Fight: The Game.























When it works, it's awesome. This game is very well made, and very fun to play. There are a few kinks, but the developers are alreay working on ironing those out- and it's been out for less than a week at the time of writing. For five dollars, there's really no reason not to buy it. Hell- buy a few copies for your friends.



My friend Katie's laughter and my screams of ""JESUS CHRIST JESUS CHRIST THE SNAKES ARE INSIDE ME CHRIST"" scored me a noise complaint, and someone next door who hadn't even seen any gameplay purchased it immediately.


Also: You should vote this for the Steam Awards. It would be cool to see it pickup even more traction.",Recommended,129,4

Stick Fight: The Game is a simplistic physics-based game that draws its inspiration from stickman fighting animations on the internet. At first sight, it bears a striking resemblance to Gang Beasts in terms of gameplay. In this game too, your sole aim is to beat each other to death and be the last stickman standing and by doing so, you're literally crowned. But ironically, the funniest thing about Stick Fight is dying. Due to the hilarious ways you can die in this game, you will always have a good laugh whenever you die. It's either because of your silly mistake or your opponent's extremely ""calculated"" shot.

The levels are designed in a way to challenge the contestants, so that you can use the environment to your advantage if you act cleverly. For instance, in the winter setting, you will have ice which will break when you shoot at and the stickman standing on it will fall to his death. Besides the winter setting, you have for instance, a factory setting with chains holding your platform, a lava setting where the floor is lava and so on. Each level within these settings has a certain pattern that expects you to overcome.

In terms of weapons, except your fists of course, there are pistols, sniper rifles, shotguns, RPG, minigun, laser beams, grenade launchers and last but not least, guns that shoot poisonous snakes. Weapons will also cause a physical reaction due to their exaggerated recoil. So, don't be surprised if you find yourself flying when you're spraying that minigun. In other words, it's safe to say that the variety of levels and weapons won't let you and your friends get bored fast.

After the first fun 10 minutes though, you will realize there is no purpose or an end to the game. There is no ultimate winner, no scoreboard or leaderboards whatsoever. So I suggest you don't go into this game expecting more than just having fun and a laugh with your friends.

As for the controls, I used a controller to play this game since keyboard/mouse felt a bit uncomfortable. It's possible to use multiple controllers too, you can hop into an online game with you two being on the same couch or just play locally.

If you have friends to play with and you enjoy physics-based games, this title is a must-play. Considering the price tag, the tons of joy you will derive from playing this game for a couple of hours is well worth paying for. Despite the fact that this game is fully released and not in early-access, it continously receives updates, new levels, weapons and features too. So, don't miss out on this one.",Recommended,32,1

Stick Fight: The Game

Stick Fight intrigued me. I had been a follower of Landfall's previous games and projects. They had a unique, simplistic art style fitted with a bundle of content. And when I saw this in my email one day at school, I knew I had to buy it. Me and my friend both loved stick animation since we were as young as 9, and we love party games.



The gameplay is one of my favourite aspects. Being Landfall, they are bound to have satisfyingly floppy animations, and they deliver. Backflips, frontflips, diving, Naruto running, and so much more is available to do in the world. Me and my friend even RP as different people from different countries thanks to the wide variety of guns and environments. Even though the fighting commences in a closed box, it is the perfect amount of space needed for long range, medium range and melee battling to take place.

Not much is to really be said here, one graphics option on a dropdown menu and resolution options. I play at a low resolution, and it's good to know they optimised it well, just like T.A.B.S. It's kind of a shame they didn't allow for particle options, however, as one of the laser levels cuts my framerate to pieces.

The servers are, for the most part, consistent and steady. However, I would like for there to be more options. I won't babble on too much about this, because the game is only 2 days old, but there is only one mode. Deathmatch. I would like a variety of modes like being able to team up with friends, a gamemode similar to the conveyor belt box level, where you jump and evade boxes or lasers while running. However, the game is only two days old, as I've mentioned. It's subject to development, and they have a huge update coming soon.

A little side note here, the developers do not have this as their main priority at the moment. It is currently T.A.B.S, and this game is what they have done in their free time. So, if there are no updates for a few months, it's nothing to rally on about. Just be patient and they'll give updates and more content further on.

I really like the music in this game. It fits the tone of messy brawls and speedy jolts, but the music does repeat itself over the course of time, and you will hear the same tune played again after a while. My friend likes to play this game with no music but rather the punching audio, maybe you'll do the same.

Well, this is going to sound rather preachy, but there are basically no major cons that I can give to the game. Two minor ones I have previously mentioned are the graphics limitations and servers sometimes lagging a tad, but there's basically nothing bad about this game. Maybe the price is something to go against, but a game is a game.

This game is utterly fantastic. I recommend buying this game if you need something to play with friends, love fast-paced action or brutal beatdowns. This game does remind me of Gang Beasts, a game I have reviewed negatively in the past, but this is the Gang Beasts everyone wanted. Laughs, beatdowns and difficulty.
This is a great game to have in your library. Over the course of some updates, you might find yourself crawling back to it.
Have fun!",Recommended,43,5

The modern history of Western pornography begins with the Enlightenment (18th century), when printing technology had advanced enough to permit the production of written and visual materials to appeal to audiences of all socioeconomic levels and sexual tastes. A small underground traffic in such works became the basis of a separate publishing and bookselling business in England. A classic of this period was the widely read Fanny Hill; or, Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (1748–49) by John Cleland. At about this time, erotic graphic art began to be widely produced in Paris, eventually coming to be known in the Anglophone world as “French postcards.”",Recommended,90,0

There's not a whole LOT to say about this game to be honest.

It's great fun.
It's essentially a up to 4-Player PvP game with all kinds of weapons or no weapons at all.
A whacky fun arcade-y game where you just beat every other player and you win that round and it cycles seemlessly to the next.
There's about 20 or so core maps? (They last around an hour before it starts repeating the same maps.)


Any user can submit their own levels and you can edit yours for you and your friends to play in.
The game is very small and the price is even smaller and it's amazing, I would totally recommend it especially on a sale (If you're worried about the price being abit too much.)


Due to the aforementioned lack of CORE maps and the game in general being a short wacky fun time it might get boring shortly after an hour or two.


That in my opinion depends on the player.",Recommended,26 people found this review helpful 0,1

A fun game to play with friends. I recommend it. While you're here, please enjoy this pie recipe:

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",Recommended,942,37

Worms Armageddon review
WUM is one of the best Worms title of all times. I know it's far from the original idea, but it's a good example of well implemented changes: it's a 3D version of the popular game, and does its job fairly well. Here are some PROs and CONs, so you can evaluate it yourself.

PROs
- It's Worms, it's in 3D
- The return of the craziest weapons of all times, with some newer ones
- Speaking about weapons, you can create your own special one
- Worms can be customized in lots of different ways
- Game modes can also be customized at your wish
- A very good amount of contents.
(Not only the Mayhem campaign, in fact, even the 3D's one!)
- You can also challenge yourself with... Challenges!
- Deathmatch is, like any other game mode aside from the story, playable in local or online
- Every historical era has its own easter eggs
- Steam achievements!

- Even if there's an online option, you probably won't find anyone playing.
This also means that some achievements are impossible to get, if you're into that.
- Playing with a keyboard is perfectly doable but...
You either have to reassign the commands or just have patience with the learning curve; don't worry though, this is absolutely normal for the majority of games
- You think *overused ""hard"" game* was hard? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Seriously, there's a lot of trial and error, especially in late game (and that's not necessarily a bad thing, imho)

All in all, this game deserves to be played.
Online multiplayer is, imho, an option from which I can safely do without.",Recommended,95,0

🟡 Requires heavy tinkering

1) To fix resolution problem change the ""high DPI settings"" of the game executable:
- Find the game executable WormsMayhem.exe on your system (manage > browse local files).
- Right-click the executable, then select Properties.
- Switch to the Compatibility tab and click on Change high DPI settings, under ""Settings"".
- On the new window, under ""High DPI scaling override"", activate the checkbox: [✓].
- Select Application from the dropdown menu and confirm with OK.
- Click Apply, then OK on the Properties window.
- Launch the game.

2) Worms Ultimate Mayhem Anniversary Patch:


Fixes performance issues, enables support for all languages present in the game files, removes the sepia effect in the Worms 3D campaign levels, as well as many other things.

3) To fix controls disable Steam Direct Input: Right click on the game > Properties > Controller Options

4) To fix button prompts touch the touchscreen (so it register as a mouse input) and press any button. This should enable proper xbox prompts.

After hundreds of hours and over 10 years, I figured it's about time I sit down and write a review for this masterpiece in gaming history. This gem holds a very special place in my heart, and it will forever be one of my all-time favorite games. To me, this is Team17's magnum opus. It doesn't get any better than this. It is the reason I first began to engage with the Steam community years ago when I created the Worms Ultimate Mayhem Militia with my brother, and it's the reason I have hundreds of friends on Steam today. To put it quite simply, Worms Ultimate Mayhem isn't just a game, it's one of my passions. I know the new Rumble has beautiful graphics and a much larger playerbase, and the 2D games like Armageddon are beloved and often regarded as best, but in my humble opinion this is the greatest Worms game there is.

I also understand I'm in the minority for preferring 3D, but despite what the diehards say, I don't think worms was ""meant"" to be played in 2D just because that was the original formula. It just happens to be the style most fans were introduced to and are familiar with. I think the natural evolution of the franchise was clearly to move into 3D and fully utilize the physics-based play style Worms is so well known for. In fact, I'd argue that nearly every 2D worms game is just a remaster/""directors cut"" of the game before it with bonus features. The IP was basically a series of stagnant remakes for a decade. 3D was a game-changer, and quite literally added an entire new dimension to the same old stale platformy gameplay we were starting to see mimicked all over the place in flash arcades and early mobile games. Now it's come full circle and Worms is the one imitating recent popular games with Rumble.

While I am overjoyed that Worms got new game and a nice makeover, I am a bit disappointed to see the new direction they've decided to take. Turn based combat is one of the staples of Worms, and I personally think changing the formula to real-time completely destroys half of the strategy. A huge part of what makes Worms enjoyable for me is the casual pace of the game. It's all about taking turns watching each other pull off impressive maneuvers, lucky shots, scheming stratagems, and just generally making asses of ourselves. I'm a bit of an expert in the lattermost category.

WUM is when the formula reached near perfection in my opinion, unpopular though it may be. I'll be the first to say it's far from flawless. It still has so much more potential. The problem is, 2D Worms had generations to perfect the recipe. Out of 23 Worms games, 3D only really got 3 major titles, and the final one is just a remastered combo of the previous two. It is my sincere hope that the franchise returns to a 3D style in their next Worms title, but until then you will find me playing this. Although admittedly not without it's shortcomings, this was and IS peak Worms.",Recommended,47,7

Worms 3D (WUM) is a almost like playing chess. Explosive, humorous chess...

A true gem of the past, that is way more appealing than all the new 2D worms games that have been relased quite recently.

Not much of a player base for online matches, so it would be nice to have friends to play with.

Despite that, it is indeed a wonderful way to pass the time without wasting brain cells.

Worms Ultimate Mayhem (2011)

Worms Ultimate Mayhem is Worms 4 Mayhem (2005) with improved graphics and feature the campaign from Worms 3D. My playtime on Steam does not reflect my true playtime of Worms 4 Mayhem as my dad owns the physical disc.

Let me start with a story. My dad visited one of his friends and his friend showed him Worms. My dad loved the idea of the game and it was one of the few games that ever fascinated him (in 2005 my dad was 44 years old). He asked me if I know about Worms, I told him yes and that I played with my friend the game each Tuesday at his house (Worms World Party). One day while out shopping with my mother she saw Worms 4 Mayhem and decided to buy it for my dad. This was basically day one release so it was still full price. We gave him the game and he was in heaven. We both installed the game and traded the disc to play cause once you are in game you could remove the cd. He played every night after work. I had to show him that he had to complete the campaign to unlock more maps and stuff cause he kept playing the same maps over and over. Worms 4 Mayhem will forever be a game that brings me these good memories back. People always say games should be played for fun and you should play the games that make you happy - this game made me and my dad very happy.

Worms Ultimate Mayhem was a pleasant surprise a few years later and I picked up a copy for myself. The campaign is funny and a lot of fun to play and the the spirit of the Worms 2D games are still here in the 3D environment. I do know many people disliked the 3D games and I myself was a bit sceptical of it but after learning the controls I wasted many hours in the game (It took me forever to learn how to use the Super Sheep as his camera was insane to navigate in 3D). I can't really say too much about Worms. Its either a game you grew up with or your just curious to see why worms would randomly blow each other up. This is probably the only game I ever played where we played together on one pc - ""hotseat mode"". I will forever love these games and it brought me and my dad closer together, I will forever be grateful for that.

Instead of telling you why this game is amazing I rather first tell you a story of how I fell in love with Worms 3D!

I was 14 when Worms 3D came out and at the time I didn't have a PC at home, instead I had to rely on various gaming clubs and friends to get my gaming fix. I remember when I first launched the game at a friend's house and was immediately captivated by the colorful and absurd world of a fully 3D Worms game! Before this I had played the other more traditional Worms games with many friends but this particular one fueled my imagination like nothing before it... That first playthrough took me the whole afternoon to enjoy and I didn't stop playing for even a second! Before I knew it it was dark outside and I had to head home, I was so into the game world that I honestly could see weird colors and shapes as I made my way through the corridor and into the dimly lit elevator. That same night I had weird vivid dreams about the cartoonish worms and their bizzare world... The following years I started drawing worms everywhere, I even created my own comic for my friends to enjoy that featured slugs with guns! It was very original and was in no way influenced by the worms, I swear!

Many Worms fans disregard the 3D entries as some weird spinoffs undeserving of the Worms name but I know that if they gave those games enough time they'll see the charm and uniqueness that I saw as an early teen!

So yes give this game a chance! Let the worms make their way inside you and burrow deep inside your heart and mind! Embrace the annelid infestation and fall in love with a truly great game for all ages and tastes!",Recommended,31,4

Worms 3D + Worms 4 Mayhem together, with remastered graphics? Awesome!

All is good, good except the lack of effort put into it.
I almost feel like they were doing something good but quit half-way because deadlines or something, they didn't even do much follow up after release besides patching game-breaking bugs that didn't allow people to play at all. If I'm recalling correctly the beta correctly, they were trying to put the teleporter utility back in, but ended up not for who knows what reason (although I never got to play it at that time personally due to game launching bugs, so I watched someone else also in the beta who could).

Secondly, the lack of Wompot in unraked matches despite still being workable with no bugs (tested with cheat engine), and not being able to choose your team color online is rather disapointing. What's your beef T17? You are doing no one any favours by gradually removing features every game, you actually discontented customers. I can garentee my play time would be almost double it is now if wormpot wasn't removed from unranked matches where you play with friends.
Speaking of lack of effort, want to know something about one of the DLC maps? It litterally looks like it was generated with the in-game map editor, but they added in a few insignificant objects to it to make it qualify as a DLC. Gross.

What's with Team 17 and bombing their remasters? First this, now Worms World Party.

I can't really recommend or not recommend this game over the older games. This is a 2 in 1 game with enhanced looks (and voice acting for W4M story), and has a huge imporvement on physics and camera movement over the original W3D (though, it is practically the same with W4M), but due to the removal of some core features it really gets brought down (I can't even play a modded game without a modded .exe now).",Recommended,29 people found this review helpful 0,0

Great strategy series and tons of fun with friends. Most versions of Worms are pretty awesome so I feel like you really can't go wrong with which one you want to try, but this one is my wife's favorite so it's got a bit of special spot on my list.

This one changes things up by playing in 3D but otherwise is more or less the same as the other games. It has a fairly long campaign mode, a bunch of challenges, and tons of customization to unlock.

Best Game ever!
whatever we will said,if you break through the game,This is the best worm game ever.
you can use your skills of rope to give a show to your mate,also can compete very seriously and really closed in game.
No matter you like which worms version,I suggest WORMS ULTIMATE MAYHEM.
because full of fun when make a mistake,charactors is cute,every game won't be very long and relaxing.The only buggy is we cannot see who is online,we need to join our worms group and invite players.
No matter you are newbies or old hands,you can +rep to me.Ask me about skills,rules...
Have seen my performance of worms skills you will think this is an amazing game not a childern toy.And only few pro can beat me in long multi games.
As I see either the comments under the shop or sercurity of worms,this game is much more worldwide than any we say cold games ever become.
So worms player should get together and communicate each other,not only to play a slow hand game with friends and family.
I will bring you to our steam worms group and you will find standard rule best pro Neo,Indiant,Mauro93ita.BnG pro (blind-aim Vectomon),rope pro MasuO,Russian Fast Hand Demon etc...
And a lot of another ones full of fun with funny behaviour in multi.",Recommended,24,1

I was 3D Worms fan as a kid. Is this game is a childhood ruined or exchanced? I'm on the fence.

This game is more or less an expanded version of old Worms 4: Mayhem. Most notable changes are graphical upgrades and Worms 3D singleplayer campain available to beat. Those are fine additions and the core gameplay is still okay, but there are noticable problems.

Overall art still is a cartoony but normal-looking 3D graphics clash with poor cel-shaded explosion effects - this combination just don't work. Old Worms 3D effects where more eye inviting. Music is completely horrible. Worms 3D (game) and Armagedonn had a distinctive styles: happy-party and grim-doomy respectively. This game is just bland with uninspiring music and no art direction.

Game is slower paced than a 2D worms, which is not a bad thing on it's own. However, overall experience isn't what fun, thanks to the sluggish weapon and utilities physics. Weapons behave very strangely. Some are extremely reliable (constant 50DMG Bazooka shots) or suprisingly unreliable (Banana Bomb). On top of that, AI is still stupid as a Sheep. Team 17 never programmed a fine artificial enemies.

Worms 4 singleplayer missions are uninspired. they are paired with pretty bland story around them. The included Worms 3D missions are more interesting. They are compact, focused and not bounded in half-baked story arcs.

Menus ergonomy and UI needs a complete rework. Hidden important options, difficult navigation, poor visuals.

This game is somethat a fun experience, but you need other people with the same preference to the 3D Worms games as you. With friends, you will have a blast, thanks to the better controls and hilarity of events. You don't have such people around you? Make a pass. You had enough of Worms in 3D (no matter, if in the good or bad way)? Make a pass. I'm still giving this game a Upvote, but it is a close one. I feel really generous today or maybe I feel nostalgic to those original Worms 3D missions?",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 0,0

You Like Team17?
Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when ""Worms"" came out in '95, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.The whole franchise has some clear, crisp gameplay, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the games a big boost. He's been compared to ""HedgeWars"", but I think Team17 has a far more finalised, polished game.
In 2011, Team17 released this; ""Worms Ultimate Mayhem"", their most accomplished game. I think their undisputed masterpiece is weapon customisation. A mechanic so original, most people probably don't realise its there. But they should, because it's not just about the personal customisation and the importance of fun. It's also a personal statement about the game itself.",Recommended,18,0

The two 3D Worms titles (Worms 3D and Worms 4: Mayhem) packaged together in a collector's edition of sorts, which comes with many small improvements (mostly graphical). The 3D entries are typically held to be the weakest in the series, but I think they have been unjustly treated by most players. The game as a whole seems to lack the elegance (it does take quite a bit longer to learn the basics) of the 2D titles, and there's not much that can be done about that - It has less of that ""pick up and play"" quality of the other Worms games.

If you do get over the initial bump, you'll discover a rather charming turn based artillery game. All of the classic tactical considerations return in 3D (try having your bazooka shot be influenced by 3D wind!), and many new ones are introduced. Most of the old weapon and equipment dynamics remain, though to different degrees of fidelity and with an eye on enabling the new gameplay. Even terrain destruction is back, though the granularity of their weird ""poxel"" technology can often appear low (i.e. terrain and objects are composed of only a few large ""chunks""), and the environmental damage always occurs in a distinctly ""blocky"" fashion.

It feels like a console port through and through (you cannot even select weapons with hotkeys - a staple of PC Worms), and the UI is rather garish. The game can be a bit unstable, and crashes when you minimize/maximize the game window are not unheard of.

Even if it didn't have a solid and enjoyable MP mode (if lacking in customization options), I would still recommend this game solely for its campaign. Worms 3D and Worms 4: Mayhem have by far the best SP missions of any Worms game, and they're all available in Ultimate Mayhem. A lot of variety and creativity on display, and it can be rather challenging to beat the par time on some of them. It really does seem like the SP was Team 17's main focus for the 3D games, which makes them even more unusual.",Recommended,11 people found this review helpful 0,0

Solid game.

Pros:
+ The Graphics
+ The Music
+ The Gameplay is solid (If you get to know the controlls, which are simple, but still a lot more complicated, compared to W:A)
+ A lot of improvements were made since W3D

Cons:

For the record my favorite Worms game of all time is Worms Armageddon. The art style, the game play, weapons, level editor, and game layout (options, theme, layout of menus) were all done right. This is when games were made to be bought once, and to be bought as a whole.

I saw Worms Ultimate Mayhem as a recommended game instead of Armageddon. The first thing that caught my eye was that this game was the 3D version of what I loved so much. I figured for the on sale price, I'll give it a shot. I can tell you that I am not at all disappointed with my purchase (except that Worms is still a turn based game! I wish they would make a real time one - how? Well I'm not getting paid to make or suggest games). Seeing worms in 3D is phenomenal, and the art and them style they chose to go along with the game just fits it perfectly. The game play is just as good as ever, however will take some time to adjust and get used to the new range/power system. I didn't know a worm could throw a grenade three football fields away from the map. Lesson learned.

Game play itself can be seen from first person or third person worm view. Weapons are varied as usual and are cool to use and shoot. The explosive or corrosive materials found around the map can also be used to eliminate your opponent. Does the 3D land disappear after you blow it up? Damn right it does. How are the camera angles? Actually quite consistent when using weapons, can be a bit confusing or frustrating when simply observing the map. I find that even with unchecking the inverse box for camera angles sometimes it turns itself back on. This is usually fixed by simply squaring the screen with the worm again. That's essentially the only complaint I have is the camera controls.

This game does have CONTROLLER SUPPORT - which is greatly appreciated. It can be a little choppy though... which can effect the level of you liking this game. It is a fun game - and can keep you busy for a while with the story, challenges, or just a quick match if you're able to work with the wonky/blocky controls.

For future Mayhem games (or 3D worm games), maybe try getting rid of the turn based system, or play around with allowing more first person type of play. Do something XCOM : enemy unknown would do (wait, take cover and fire at the enemy when in range) with worms the player isn't using. Also, please try to improve the camera controls!

(I did get this game on sale :)

Typical Worms game, funny and fun. A childhood classic from the PS2 era. I can only recommend it.
It's fun, it's simple, and its 3D. They buffed the original graphic options for the steam release, so it supports up-to 21:9 screen ratio and 75Hz refresh rate or more.

This game is good - but they f***ed up. I still have my Worms 4 Mayhem cd and wanted to have a more usable experience (as in steam multiplayer and a game that is availible). Worms 4 Mayhem is super fluent and the graphics look the same. Worms Ultimate Mayhem is ... how do i put it ... spongy. You put your aim at a target, stop the mouse and the reticle overshoots. In 4 Mayhem your inputs are direct without overshooting. Coming from this, Ultimate Mayhem is almost unplayable.",Not Recommended,17 people found this review helpful 0,0

i think this was the correct evolutionary path for Worms adn they should go back to this and improve on it. Worms 1 (the OG, they also tried to make the original bizarrely enough, have believable kind of graphics, it wasnt as cartoony outside of the cutscenes) and Worms Armegeddon and this 3D version are the best worms i think ive played. Hopefully they go back to the 3D formula.

This game is worms 2D....but an evolution to 3D and id like to see more of this particular version down the line.

Just a sidenote, make sure you go into your game files and install the directx9 and C++ files in the redist folder to make it work AND right click the game exe application and go to properties and compatability tab and change settings for all users (is what i do, but it might not be necessary)

Worms Ultimate Mayhem is no doubt an evolution to not just Worms 3D (the game that brought the iconic strategic series featuring the charming worms full of character from the 2D realm over into the fancy new 3D world) but also further improving what the series has to offer as far as campaign story missions and character creation goes alongside other nifty features!

To start off here, seeing as this is the 8th game in the well-established series, (or 10th if you include the spin-offs Worms Blast and Worms Golf) Ultimate Mayhem brings out a whole new host of levels set across five different timelines in twenty five unique missions alongside three crafty tutorials and a bunch of extra challenges to boot, whereby the goal is as it's always been: To destroy the enemy worm team by any means necessary!

Though given that the story here has been given something of a 'make-over', seeing how the missions in all previous Worms campaigns had you do random stuff strewn across a multitude of different landscapes without any narrative coherence between one and the next, as Ultimate Mayhem brings time-travelling into the equation as you start off in 'modern' (though the game contextualizes it as the 'construction' period) where the game goes relatively easy on you at first before throwing in the harder challenges once you get into the four other time periods, that being Medieval, Wild West, Arabian and Prehistoric.

Now seeing as the gameplay transition from 2D to 3D was always going to be a bit of a challenge for Team 17 to rework here, I can hardly fault them for making it a tad on the easier side of things (believe me, I've tried the original Worms on Steam here and it's FAR more unforgiving even when you just have the 2D gameplay to worry about!) as I've always gotten the impression that both Worms 3D and this game were aimed at a more casual audience, people who enjoy the vast strategies offered in a destructive turn-based game such as the Worms series but often preferred to be introduced at a more 'gentle slope' so to speak!

Given how there is a lot more freedom when it comes to the exploration and navigation side of things, the AI still holds up well enough for the most part (although I say this primarily as an amateur Worms enthusiast) but experienced strategy gamers may find themselves disappointed when they put the AI to the test as opposed to messing around for fun since a key part of success in Worms games is positioning your worms in the best places for attacking the enemy as well as keeping them safe from as many types of attacks as possible, with how a safe tactic to winning many of this game's missions here is finding the quickest way for the enemy to be introduced to the blue depths of the water for a quick and easy kill! (Baseball bats are the easiest by far, with fire punches trading horizontal distance for vertical height and shotguns being weaker on the push side of things but granting you two shots instead of one)

Touching upon the character creation itself, Ultimate Mayhem adds more depth to the already improved formula of Worms 3D by allowing the player to fully customize their team members, going further than just the team's flag, voicebank and grave by presenting a wide variety of hats and wigs for worms to don on their heads, various gloves/glasses and moustaches/beards to don and even having their very own unique 'team weapon' that was introduced in this game which lets you create either a firearm, grenade or air strike of your own making, letting you adjust the damage to worms/land and strength of the blast itself alongside other various elements that are either positive or negative, seeing as Team 17 thankfully made a good job of balancing it so that you didn't make a god-tier weapon that could easily be made more accessible than the ultimate weapons featured in this game!

Speaking of which, the variety offered in this game is a point of contention for some as there is a smaller total of 39 unique weapons and tools compared to Worms 3D's more substantial 46, though given the new inclusions here such as Starburst that acts as a more versatile Kamikaze, Sentry Gun that acts as an automated turret that shoots at any moving worms within range with multiple cartridges per turret and Alien Abduction that puts a spin on the old Battle Axe by throwing in random teleportation and health gain/loss effects that can either benefit or harm the affected worms, it is debatable as to whether the loss of classics like the Homing Pigeon and Scales of Justice among others is worth the new weapons for some.

On the note of remasters, seeing as I have been referring to this game as 'Ultimate Mayhem' and not the original game's title 'Worms 4: Mayhem', the changes made to this version of Ultimate Mayhem include improvements to the graphics by updating them to High Definition standards, online multiplayer to take the strategic gameplay of Worms to the next level with real human players and a whole assortment of new challenges not previously in the original Mayhem game on the PS2 and Xbox alongside all the missions from Worms 3D! (Plus various Quality of Life updates to further refine the tried-and-tested gameplay of the series)

Truth be told, the game itself does hold up pretty well for the most part though, alongside the aforementioned issue of difficulty and less weapon variety compared to Worms 3D, I do have some problems with the AI not being as capable or as smart as they were in the 2D games which, whilst contradictory to a point I made about this and Worms 3D being more accessible due to being easier to find success in through it's less complex (and competent) enemy AI, I find ultimately detracts from any serious competitive gameplay as the only challenge you'll find outside of beating some of Team 17's own personal times on each mission is to play online with other players.

Sadly the online itself is it's own issue as, despite trying for well over an hour of constant waiting and fiddling about, I was only ever able to get one single match and no more, which itself is a shame as Worms Ultimate Mayhem has plenty to offer with it's 3D take on the dynamic strategic gameplay that this game provides, though it would seem that Worms Armageddon has the most popularity when it comes down to the overall fanbase.

In conclusion, Worms Ultimate Mayhem is well-worth revisiting here in 2024, seeing as it still has plenty of the iconic tactical gameplay that is rather unique to this series and, when combined with that charming Worms humour and all the new bonuses and additional content provided in the remaster, it holds up surprisingly well for a game that originally released almost two whole decades back in 2004.

Definitely worth a purchase in my eyes here!

TLDR Version:

• A return to 3D Worms gameplay with the remaster featuring HD graphics, online matches and the whole compaign from Worms 3D alongside new challenges being added (+)
• Fully customizable worms with dozens of hats, glasses, facial hair and gloves to make your team stand out alongside a creative 'team weapon' system exclusive for your team's use with balanced customizable parameters (+)
• Improved story with voiced cutscenes telling the wacky story of a 25 mission long adventure travelling across 5 unique time periods (+)
• Worms Ultimate Mayhem is more accessible to casual players as a result of the AI not being so aggressive coupled with more options to tackle opponents in the 3D world (+)

• The variety of weapons in Mayhem (39) is less than it's predecessor (46) which the remaster sadly does not fix with bringing classic weapons from the prequel (-)
• Ultimate Mayhem's AI is not as competent as it could be, resulting in less of a fun challenge for experienced veterans of the Worms series (-)
• Online is close to dead as finding matches with other players can take a long time without friends who also play the game (-)",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 3,3

Gotta give this game a negative review for two reasons. Controller support and the content from the older games it promised.

Normally I'd understand if a game doesn't have good controller support if it wasn't originally made for use with one. Or perhaps the game just doesn't lend itself very well for use with a controller. That's fine. But since this game includes levels the Playstation 2 game it should worked perfectly fine with my PS4 controller. Here it doesn't. They had all the resources to match it with that older game. The mappings included are horrid and trying to get it set up like it originally was is tiresome and still doesn't work quite right. The menus hardly work at all as well no matter my mappings. Plus without having the original game in front of me I don't know for sure how it used to be set up so I was never able to get it right. Plus I had to use DS4Windows instead of native support which shouldn't be needed.

Also speaking about that PS2 game, they included some of the levels from that game which was great. However they didn't include all the levels. I bought this game because I wanted to relive the PS2 days on a better system, my PC. And if they don't include that entire experience then I don't care as much for this version.

So yeah, this game wasn't what I was hoping for nor was able to be played very well and let me down.",Not Recommended,16,0

Join the Hype once more! We're talking about a Worms game that belongs in Team17 Studios' 3D series, which I personally love! (Oh boy! I can't forget how many hours I've spent with Worms 4: Mayhem). The game's mechanics are pretty simple, meaning that you can Move/Scope/Shoot easily. The use of a Joypad is highly reccomended since it makes it a lot easier for you to play this specific game. Well, the game's Single Player storyline is smooth and very , but what is more exciting and fun to play is its Multiplayer! Moreover you have the option to customize and to create your own Weapons and of course the Worm's Outfits and Style, which I find really good and interesting if I may say. Furthermore the game's goal is simple and that is what makes it ""easy"" as I mentioned before. .To sum up its a valid game to play if you want to relax and have some fun, especially if you have your friends with. Finally I have to mention that there are many 2D Worms releases that are also good and viable ( Worms: Reloaded).

Is the game fun? Yes.

Is it perfect? Not at all!
The controls are clunky and not great. The camera adjustment can be annyoing.

WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE THE CUTSCENES IN THE WORMS 3D CAMPAIGN ARE UNSKIPABLE?! WHY?! WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TEAM17?! The game already has the feuture to skip cutscenes in it. Why would you take it away? It's really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annyoing when you die for the 50th time and you have to rewatch the stupid cutscenes again and again. You can skip the cutscenes in the main campaign (story mode of worms 4). So again, why the ♥♥♥♥ would you remove this feature from the Worms 3D campaign?!

The game sometimes lags for no damn reason. So performance is meh. I'm also pretty sure that this game is locked at 30 fps. EDIT: yap, it is locked to 30 fps. I just checked it.

I haven't tried multiplayer yet but from what I can see from the reviews here it's pretty barren there.

Excellent remaster

Twelve years after the original release and five years after the ""Ultimate"" re-release, this title still holds out very well. Graphics are great, humor is witty, and the amount of content packed into this updated version is satisfying. Achievements were challenging but definitely doable if you've got a buddy up for some multiplayer havoc. Totally grab this for a good price.

Worms.
On the one day you choose to be the first worm, on another day you choose to be the second worm. You make use of the second amendment, you arm yourself with what is your very human right and you go out and fight for what you believe in: Liberty, Freedom of Speech, Sanctity of Jesus Christ and Federalism.

Worms is a tactical RTS strategy war simulation shooter where you take up arms with your worms and shoot onto other worms. You, the player, switch between what worms you play, arm everyone individually and go out to defend what you believe in by crushing your foes using your immense fire power.
This game is another symbolism of what is going on in the real world. A cry for help by the brave developers to the players, the citizens of the world and defend what is good and holy.

First of all, this game actively supports the right of a healthy minded citizen to bear arms. You get to see the actual destruction, the crushing power of your arms against those who want to take away your freedom, those who want to remove what you believe in by replacing it with something sinister and dark.
Do you, dear reader, believe in freedom of speech, in the right to exercise any kind of religion without having the state interfering with your affairs? Then this game is for you. You will go out, arm your worm and actively defend your rights.

The developer promises that for every shot fired in this game, a real shot against a globalist is done which means that with every worm you kill in this game, we make a step further in winning this war against the world government, against dictatorship and people trying to take away your rights.
You might ask yourself ""Why should I play this game to do something that I do not feel the consequences for?"" The answer is simple: America. You fight for it, no matter where you live and what you do, all the time, everywhere, always, anywhere. This game brings this right, this sacred ability to protect what you think is necessary and important to whole new level and this is exactly what we need.

Do not believe the mainstream media. I am just asking questions, why aren't you? This game is a gem in a massive pile of dirt, you need to acquire, you need to play, you need to study it.
Be the resistance, be the voice of freedom, be the winner of the infowar.

God bless America.",Recommended,12,0

I have played Worms Ultimate Mayhem 3 hours and counting. I wanted to write this review well after Worms had been released, all of the DLC had been released, and when the modding community had really had a good opportunity to get a foothold in. Worms is an amazing game all in all. To those people who were giving this game 0's and 10's on the very first day it was released, within the first 10 minutes of playing, all I got to say is that those reviews don't help ANYONE. A game like this takes time to grow.
Gameplay
Gameplay probably features the biggest changes and improvements of the worms series. Improvements can be found from various aspects of the game, from combat, exploration, crafting and character building. Compared to Worms Reloaded, the combat is much more responsive, faster and dynamic. Enemy variation is amazing in WUM and it was often surprising to see new features and abilities added to already known enemy types. Crafting is one of the biggest and greatest part of WUM. As soon I saw the new crafting system of WUM in E3, I knew it was going to be great and sure wasn’t disappointed. With More Worms DLC you can also build your own robots, and go far as building your own kickass Sentry Bot. With the improved crafting looting and exploration became more important and rewarding. Junk rarity was also in great balance, I often found myself missing needed materials which then motivated me go out to explore the wasteland. With the new crafting system also came the settlement mode, which allowed players to create their own towns and settlements. To me the vanilla settlement mode was dull in many ways. Either way the settlement mode can a lot of fun with mods, allowing you to actually craft something genuine and incredible. The leveling and perk system was also redesigned. While there was nothing wrong with the previous system, the new system was a welcome change.
Atmosphere
In general, the atmosphere in WUM is subtler than in previous entries. Fast Food Dino felt much brighter and hopeful than the desolate Gibbon Take or Monster Bash. This is likely due to the more vibrant weathers. To improve immersion, team17 did a nice job of reducing the amount of loading screens. Abandoned towns now could be explored without having to struggle through the 5 second loading screen every now and then.
Story and Quests
I personally enjoyed the main plot, mainly because I didn’t expect much of it I got what I expected. Most of the main storyline was very good, it definitely had some memorable moments, difficult choices and the total length of the story wasn’t too bad. As for side content and quests, which were usually good but often hard to find. Radiant quests in WUM have a large role. The highly criticized voiced protagonist and the new dialogue system didn’t bother me, which did undoubtedly pose problems. But to me they were welcome changes, which felt like taking one step back and two steps forward.
Overall
While WUM did sacrifice some of its predecessors RPG elements, it still turned out to be one of the best open-world shooter that I’ve played. Worms did change for better or worse, but as for me, it’s still a Worms game, and a damn good one.",Recommended,11,6

I am rating this poorly. For a remaster I expected this to contain the FULL worms 3d campaign and worms 4 mayhem campaign. Instead it only contains the first few missions of each. Yes, the graphics is better. But wait, it gets worse. Cool unique weapons from 3d and 4 mayhem are missing, like homing pigeon or the AI turret. I am disappointed. This is more of a buy-on-discount-so-you-can-play-with-your-friends-online title. This is not building upon the previous titles, just a sad money grab( at least its cheap on discount.)
This is NOT how to make a remaster.
What makes matters worse is that I can't get a steam or online copy of 3D or 4 Mayhem anymore, I can only buy this title.

This game... is just so good. A masterclass of gaming as a whole. Multiplayer with friends is an experience unreachable by any other game out there. Call of Duty? More like Call of Booty. Minecraft? More like Midcraft. Worms has always held a special place in my heart as a child. But revisiting this game only confirms that it wasn't nostalgia talking. This game is just as good as when it came out. And not to spoil the story mode, but good god is the Worms lore rich and full of intrigue. The campaign is full of twists and turns, witty banter, and stakes to keep you on your toes. The very first mission has you fighting in Worm D-Day. I never felt better charging the beaches with my Worm brothers. I quite literally cannot get enough of this game. If God were willing, I would play it every day for the rest of my life. I would start an entire e-sports branch dedicated to playing this exact Worms game. I would have my own team and would dominate my own competition. I beg of you, dear reader, to purchase this game for not only yourself but for your closest friends. I did and we have a bond stronger than diamond now. Stop wasting time playing lazy AAA games that are just recycled content every year. Instead, play this gem of a game. I promise, you will not regret it.",Recommended,13,1

This is a classic 3D worms, turn based, holy hand grenades, sink your opponent into the water kind of game.

It has missions from both games: Ultimate Mayhem and Worms 3D, along with many challenges, trials and customizable to unlock in-game.

Dialogues are funny, the game is challenging and enjoyable and there are a couple of different weapons from classic 2D worms. Will go for 100% at some point.",Recommended,6 people found this review helpful 0,0

A fun little game most people (including myself) got for the nostalgia factor.

The premise of the game involves a couple of worms sorted into teams duking it out in an all out war, the surviving worms ultimately win the game! The worms will use items such as bazookas and grenades to take out the worms on the opposing team (or the same team if you're feeling traitorous).
The game is best played with others and I assume the game was developed around the intention of great multiplayer battles, however, the ai is quite good if you want to play alone.

My own personal rating for this game would be 8.5/10
My rating for players who are playing without any kind of nostalgia factor would be 7/10",Recommended,7 people found this review helpful 0,2

Worms: Ultimate Mayhem is a masterpiece game of my childhood. I still played this game when I was 9 years old (somewhere in 2014-2015). I remember when my parents bought me a disk with all the parts of Worms. The most favorite for me were Worms 2 and this masterpiece. But let's get to the point.

This game is the best 3D game in this series of games. A fun turn-based strategy game that will not let you get bored in the company of friends. But if you don't have any friends, then you can play a good campaign with a good plot. There is also a plot from Worms 3D, but this is for an amateur, I personally liked it. Next, I would like to talk about the pluses and minuses of this game.

Pluses:
1. Minimum system requirements (which is logical, because the game is 2011 and will be able to run on your Pentium);
2. Fun. In this game there are several ways to make fun or kill your opponent, which gives quite a few fun strategies;
3. Random map generator. Of course, there are enough maps in this game, but the feature of this game is a map generator that places objects in a random place. This makes the game much more diverse;
4. The ability to create your own team and weapons. Of course, it's obvious with the team here, you create your own worms, give them names, a voice, hang caps on them (which you can buy in the store for coins earned in story missions), etc.. But with weapons it's more interesting: you can give them recoil, damage, explosion force and many other functions. Of course, many people will say that it is possible to make an unbalanced gun, but this is not so. There is a meter that is responsible for the"" killing power "" of the gun. If you make a gun to powerful, the meter will wedge and will not give you opportunities to create your own weapons, so adjust wisely :);
5. Since this is a turn-based strategy, in addition to boundless fun, you also need to think in some situations how to make a move and what is better to use, so you can strain your brains a little

Minuses:
1. The number of players online is low, but this can not be considered a minus if you play with friends, but still if you want to play with random, then you will have to look for a long time;
2. There are few game modes in the game, somewhere 5-6, but they usually play only in deathmatch. This, of course, is upsetting;
3. There are bugs here too. My friend, for example, if he wanted to take a screenshot in full-screen mode and send it to me in discord, then he had a black screen instead of a screenshot and when he returned to the game, he had no sound. Of course, we fixed this by switching to windowed mode (there also seems to be no resolution of 1920x1080, but for me personally this is not a problem, maybe I'm wrong);
4. You can't adjust the sensitivity of the mouse here, but there is no big difference for me, because I can adjust the DPI on the mouse, but before I was comfortable without it.

What can I say? Personally, I have always liked this series of games and all the games before Revolution cause me nostalgia. The game can still raise a smile on your face. It is as interesting as it has been since the last time I played it. I recommend this project to purchase, as well as to your friends, so that you can get together and have fun together.

Worms Ultimate Mayhem is generally what people consider to be the best game in the series when they don't think armageddon, wwp or w2 are. And rightfully so, the prebuilt maps are a blast, and on this version of the game, the list of them is huge. I also like how the customisation here is much more depth than in any other game in the series. Name me one other game in the series that allows you to change your hands! (don't say worms 4 mayhem). Team weapons, flags, etc. I also enjoyed the campaign, lots of light-hearted humour and originality. One mission you're destroying wind machines in order to lure out a wizard, then you're escaping from a flooding dam that was blown up by the enemy, and taking care of them. You also have to protect the Professor in some missions too! Brilliant! I haven't got to play online much, but it doesn't seem very good. Sorry guys; you know what I'm going to say, online is a ghost town.
But the single player kicks so much ass that it makes up for this.

Btw guys, I found the speech bank that fits with the speech of your worms in the story mode cutscenes; it's 'Asbo Boi'. He's a dlc voice though, in the customisation pack.

loved playing this game on the original xbox as a kid and I love that its now on pc.

pros:
-great fun to play with friends when you need a ""couch gaming"" sort of game, nothing to difficult but still good fun
-good amount of customizability to tailor how you want to play
- includes two campaigns to play if you want to enjoy the game without friends
-large array of maps all the way back from the original 3d worms game up to newer titles
-fun map destructibility

cons:
-pretty cumbersome ui design
-pretty awful performance all round, if you're playing on anything less than a mid range pc expect to run this game at 30fps for the most
-game crashes when alt tabbed
-keyboard controls arent the greatest so I reccomend either picking up a controller for this game or looking over key bindings and changing them to be less awful

overall:
if you need a casual game to play with friends every once in a while this is great fun, sadly on the technical end this game is pretty bad and might put off some from enjoying the game, I give this a solid 8/10 but I highly suggest you have friends to play this with as it is its main focus and its not very fun without others to play it with.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

The single player is the same as the 2 games espically 4 mayhem but for 4 mayhem's story and cutscenes they added voices and i think they're funny and cute XD! the multiplayer is good at best but u cant use wormpot online...uh WTF?! that would've been an amazing choice to make lots of different things to do online! and u can save random landscapes...thats nice but i still would justs probally pick one of the other landscapes.

I bought this game a while ago, when it was on sale. Loved Worms 3D, so I thought it would be worth a try. And it was! The game is very similar to 3D, except for the costomization options for your worms. Also the coin and store system has been integrated, there are even some weapons to buy for coins that you earn for mastering challenges. And the best thing: they included the Worms 3D story so even after you finished the normal story it won't get boring playing in single-player.
Although I did not dare to try the competetive mode, I would recommend this game to everyone who played Worms 3D.

This is an absolutely brilliant little game. My brother and I used to enjoy playing hours of Worms 3D when we were younger so, at £3.17 for Ultimate Mayhem and 2 DLCs, it was a no-brainer! Great fun playing the solo campaigns as well as a laugh with friends. Highly recommend (Y)",Recommended,6,1

Worms Ultimate Mayhem is one of those party game Gems that only comes around when you least expect it. Built on the foundations of Worms 3D, the game adds new maps, weapons and items that allow the player to completely customise every aspect of the game. Like many similar party games, worms has always been about its multiplayer, and this game is no exception. The game is great fun on your own and even better when playing with your friends on steam. Great fun to be had and Holy Hand Grenades to be thrown!

The only slighlty negative point of this game is the awful camera which is as buggy and unresponsive as the one in Worms 3D.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,1

I playd worms 3d as my first video game ever and worms ultimate mayhem is a great alternative for it all mechanics of worms 3d are preserved or upgraded

all worms games are 10/10 for me so go buy all of them

worms in 3d are often underrated as bad offshoot of 2d worms but thats not true, worms in 3d are on equal ground to worms in 2d and are worth playng for every worms fan

BELOW FOR PEOPLE NOT FAMILIAR WITH WORMS GAMES

you have team of worms that handle deadly weapons such as bazooka granade shotgun sniper rifle and many more

you and your oponent are one after another taking turns, each turn you or oponent controll one worm from team, your turn ends after using weapon or after tiem runs out so you spend turn getting to good position and collecting crates with weapons and than you use a weapon

its a perfect party game for more hard core party gamers sence you can play with up to 4 players at once

game has many layers of strategy and every single game is a blast

A surprise with the amount of enjoyment I got from this game. The 2 singleplayer campaigns this game compiles aren't ""masterpieces"" per se, but I would wager that they're among the few in this series that are actually worth trying.
The little stories that are built for each mission is quite charming and I think Team 17 achieved the peak of their humour here. The writing can be a little cheeky but most of all charming.
The map design also feels interesting with the particular settings and themes they include. There's also a lot of variety with how you'll see a different gimmick or objective on every other mission, that seems unparalleled in the series.
The only issue with the campaigns is how conservative missions can be on landscape destruction and degradation. Some missions you'll be able to create massive craters with explosives, and then there's some which don't allow that, presumably to make mission completion more carefree for the player, but it does feel at times like the game is neutered somewhat.

The transition to 3D feels well realised here. There's still some issues with the camera when hugging walls, but it does feel like the game is designed to accommodate this new camera angle in several ways to the player's advantage. The Worms games have a tendency to include physics that are equal parts humorous and frustrating, and this game executes that well here. I've had several moments where I make my worm jump but he bounces off the edge of some terrain and falls into the dreaded ""drink"" to drown. It's something you have to take into account like in any other Worms game.

Given how lukewarm some of the entries in this series can be, this one in comparison feels like Team 17 firing on all cylinders... well, that is until we consider the problems this port faces. This quality game isn't being maintained by anybody but passionate fans. So your vanilla experience may include weird performance, crashes (mine personally crashed twice on the Dracuworm mission), there's a bug on mission 6 of the Worms 3D campaign that makes it impossible to complete so you have to look around for a solution, and other such technical issues.
Somewhat reluctant on the thumbs up because of the above paragraph, but the core game is good fun so that's why I settled on the recommend.",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,0

If the 3D branch of the Worms series didn't irk you, then you will find this really is the ultimate edition. It has the Worms 3D campaign as well as a new one, and tons of other new features. My Xbox One controller is working quite well, although the game didnt tell me what buttons did what. You do need a mouse or keyboard to skip the launcher.

It's definitely a charming game. I really think it could have benefitted from a little cel-shading but otherwise, it runs great, and the destructable environments make things very dynamic. Of course, most fans feel like the move to 3D made the game too unreliable to play and I tend to agree, but I'm still enjoying it. It's just a very different game. You'll find arching lobbed grenades way harder, but direct line of sight attacks are much easier to hit. And it also gives you an indicator for when melee attacks will make contact, so you won't goof them up.

Good game here. I'll keep returning to it, but it wont replace the 2D Worms experience. It's a supplement.",Recommended,11,0

Worms Ultimate Mayhem is by far Team17's best game ever. The cutscenes are beautiful, the jokes are extremely humorous and the gameplay is a great mix of a strategy and shooter game. Although, the graphics may be a tad bit outdated, I can forgive Team17 because of how immersive and entertaining Worms Ultimate Mayhem's gameplay is. In my 2.7 hours of playing this game, I have never stopped smiling. Worms Ultimate Mayhem makes me the happiest girl in the world, I don't know where I would be without Worms Ultimate Mayhem. Worms Ultimate Mayhem may be the best game I have ever played, and I have played a lot of great games such as: Worms 2: Armageddon, Worms 3D, Worms Battlegrounds and Worms Forts: Under Siege, just to name a few.

Not to mention, Worms Ultimate Mayhem's amazing campaign. I wouldn't want to spoil it for any Worms Ultimate Mayhem connoisseurs who have not yet played campaign, because they were too distracted by the other fun game modes, but let's just say it is by far the best story in gaming history.

I believe Worms Ultimate Mayhem should win Game Of The Year every year. Worms Ultimate Mayhem should win Game Of the Decade every decade. Worms Ultimate Mayhem should win Game Of The Century every century. Worms Ultimate Mayhem should win Game Of The Millennium every millennium.

This game means a considerable deal to me. Because of this I have held off on writing a review because I was concerned I wouldn’t be able to remain objective, but playing this game on and off for 11 years speaks volumes of its quality, convincing me that maybe I had something worth saying.

I grew up playing Worms. When I discovered Worms 3D on the GameCube my mind was blown. 3D felt like the next logical step in progressing the series forward. The Worms gameplay loop was as fun as ever and translated into 3D smoothly. It made the game feel bigger and better without jeopardizing any of the core mechanics that gave the series its charm. It was a little janky at times, but that contributed to the chaotic nature of local multiplayer. I got years of fun out of that game.

There were a few subsequent 3D entries in the series, and it provided the time to really develop the formula. Unfortunately the majority of the Worms player base seemed to prefer the 2D titles, generally citing the tighter controls and more predictable environments allowing for a more competitive multiplayer scene.

It’s impossible to say if this public sentiment is what stopped subsequent 3D titles from releasing, but when Worms left the 3D series behind, they left with a bang. Ultimate Mayhem provided the last little bit of polish the series needed to truly perfect the 3D formula. Everything there is to love about Worms is there and is performing at peak capacity.

The weapon selection is full of so much variety and allows for so much versatility. In combination with the randomly generated maps, no match will ever be the same as the last. The worms are more expressive and full of personality than they’ve ever been before or since. The iconic Worms comedy is—of course—present, and is so ingrained into every inch of the game that it’s impossible NOT to have a good time playing this game, even if you’re losing.

That’s just local multiplayer. We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of what this game has to offer. Online multiplayer, LOADS of single player content; deathmatches, challenges, a full blown story mode, the ENTIRETY of the Worms 3D campaign in HD.

When all the game has to offer is laid out like this it makes practical sense why this game would be a good value, but the real reason I have kept playing this game for 11 years is because of how apparent the passion behind it is. Team17 went absolutely above and beyond to make this the biggest and best 3D Worms game, and that’s what allowed me to get to the point where I’m so biased about this game. It was good enough to make me buy an Xbox 360 when it released. It was good enough to spend countless hours playing match after match every weekend with the boys. It was good enough to make me purchase it a second time when I got a PC, and a third time when I got a PS3. It was good enough to convince me to 100% all the achievements TWICE.

I am biased about this game. But the quality of this game warrants it. Even now, 12 years later, no game has ever been more worth it to me. If we get another 3D Worms game I will be the happiest man alive. But if we don’t, I’ll just keep playing this game, and will keep adoring it.",Recommended,4 people found this review helpful 1,1

Worms Ultimate Mayhem is a game that defined my childhood, and it continues to bring joy even today. Gathering with relatives on weekends for some local multiplayer matches was an absolute blast, and I'll forever cherish the laughter and good times we had playing this game.

It's a true hidden gem. While once widely recognized, it seems that many have forgotten it. We're missing out on a unique experience.

A game series that got the transition from 2D to 3D right.
Ultimate Mayhem combines Worms 3D and Worms 4 Mayhem into one game and is an absolute content monster overall.
Two singleplayer campaigns with changing objectives in every mission
Challenge mode
Various multiplayer modes and options playable offline or online with up to three other players
50+ Multiplayer maps with the possibility to make your own or let the game generate a random one
Tons of options to customize your worms and create a team weapon for use in multiplayer
37 weapons and utilities, some new some from previous games

The controls are alright but need some tweaking before they are fun to use, controller support is serviceable.
One thing that is pretty subpar is everything that revolves around online play. Disconnects happen regularly and the player who's turn it is is always a few seconds ahead. Not a big problem in a turn based game but still annoying. The few seconds of wait time between turns also add up over the course of the match and make the game a bit less enjoyable.

Ultimate Mayhem offers three DLC packs which do not add all that much but one of them is free, the ""Multiplayer Pack"" has some of the best maps and the last one adds more customization for your worms. I'd say go for the Deluxe Edition.

If you plan on buying this for the multiplayer make sure you have some people to play with as otherwise you will have a hard time finding random people.

I recommend it as an easy to pick up game and rather unusual experience that is great fun in singleplayer as well as multiplayer.",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

200 character summary
Overcooked 2 is an amazingly chaotic management game for up to 4 players, chop the ingredients and cook them as fast as possible for a nice tip, There are a ton of recipes and surprising kitchens.

Story & Characters 8/10
The story is set in The Onion Kingdom, The Onion King read from an old book and he summoned these undead loafs of bread called the Unbread, They are hungry and will consume the entire Kingdom if they are not fed in time. You play as one of the many available chefs and it is your job to feed the Unbread to save the world. The story plays out trough some dialogue from the king after certain stages, The story is nothing special, but it is a funny universe and it should give you a laugh or 2.

The Onion king his dog and all playable characters are extremely likable, They don't say much but they all look very funny, If you are a shark a mouse or something way crazier, It will have a friendly face. The enemies are a little disturbing but also quite funny, Undead loafs of Bread, It probably won't give you or your children nightmares.

The game is mostly focused on multiplayer, Every single gamemode can be played with up to 4 players, Online, Local but also a mix of the 2. You also can play it solo, But you will control 2 chefs and have to switch between them to manage the kitchen. it is still the same game, A very chaotic experience, Coordinating with yourself is harder than it sounds.

There is the Story mode, which brings you to an overworld where you can launch levels, You start in 1-1 and before you can start 2-1 you have to visit the castle and talk to the Onion King. There are 6 worlds in the main campaign, and every world has 6 levels. There is a ton of DLC, some free and some paid which bring a bunch of new worlds, levels, chefs and recipes to the table. Only the host needs the DLCs, You can play along if you just own the game and are in a multiplayer game.

In the main Story you can also switch gamemodes, From Story which is the default, Practice which disables timers and Survival in which served meals add time to the timer. Next to the main Story mode there is Arcade mode, Which is just a random level from the main Story or one of the DLCs, It is a nice thing if you completed every single level with 4 stars. Then there is a Versus mode, In which 2 kitchens have to fight it out, It is always 2 versus 2, But you can play 1 vs 1 too by controlling 2 chefs.

The gameplay is extremely hectic, Raw ingredients need to be chopped, Cooked, Baked, Blended, Steamed. Grilled, and mostly they need multiple steps to prepare, Then you need to combine all the prepared ingredients on a plate and deliver it as fast as possible. There are more recipes than I can count, It starts easy, But things get complex pretty fast. Good teamwork is essential for getting all the stars.

Next to the obvious cooking you also have to wash the plates, make sure nothing burns, deliver the orders on time and make sure you don't mess up the ingredients. If you mess up a recipe you can throw it away, If it burns you have to grab the fire extinguisher and put out the fire before it spreads.

The levels are even crazier, There are kitchens with a road running trough it, People dancing in a Conga line, trough it, or even kitchens on a few floating rafts in the middle of a river. There are kitchens which have moving parts, switch positions, have portals, buttons and even cannons to reach out of reach platforms.

The graphics are adorable, It is simple but charming, Things you can interact will stay the same and are marked clearly. The decor is ever changing, You go to all kinds of restaurants, Indoor, Outdoor, On a river or high in the sky. The Soundtrack is very cosy and uplifting, But it gets tenser inside the levels as they progress, especially the last 30 seconds. It is a very nice fit, and each theme has its own soundtrack. Together it creates a very nice atmosphere that is fun and suitable for all ages.

The game runs fine, There are just 2 things that bother me, First the game Crashes on controller connect, Which is especially awful for a multiplayer game. And secondly the Steam Cloud save is not working. Other than that the game runs very well I get a very nice 200-300 fps. Not a single problem next to the 2 forementioned things. The worst thing is that these are a long standing problems. And there doesn't seem to be any interest in actually fixing it.

After you complete the story and all the DLC with 3 stars you can fight it out in Versus mode where you have to compete together with someone or solo against another kitchen. There is also Arcade mode, This will just pick a random level from the Story and DLC. There is no random generation, A lot of DLC, but even after completing everything the game remains a lot of fun, The human factor is just so unpredictable and it causes some very chaotic and funny situations.

The game is fun but frustrating, Crazy and Chaotic. Blame your friends for burning the burgers, not preparing the mushrooms and throwing sushi on the road. It is a great game and certainly worth your money, Just be sure to backup your save files.",Recommended,93,3

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Recommended,337,0

An incredibly fun and frantic couch co-op experience. We simply connected a couple of old wired Xbox 360 controllers to my PC to play this game together in our house and it was a blast! It will test the strength of your relationships, haha.
But why can't I recommend this any more? The developers released a compilation version of this game called All You Can eat which was Overcooked 1 and 2 in one bundle plus some extra features. Trouble is, they are continuing to release free content updates for that version of the game but aren't adding those updates to the base Overcooked 2 game!! So anyone who already owns 1 and 2 separately has to pay all over again for All You Can Eat if they want to receive further content updates.

Given how much I enjoyed Overcooked!, there is no way I would miss out on playing Overcooked! 2. Just like the original, 2 is a chaotic party game where you and up to 3 friends work together to serve top-of-the-line dishes while coping with and overcoming terrible kitchen designs, bizarre situations and natural disasters. In sum, frantically fun.

Played with PlayStation 4 controller, and as 2 and 3 player co-op

Positive:
Overcooked! 2 is a fantastically challenging co-op experience but is also a great party game that can be picked up by practically anyone. For the most part the controls are straightforward and the gameplay is quite intuitive but mastery takes time. The story mode offers a great experience with a challenging difficulty curve. Later levels require some mastery and efficient cooperation with your partner(s), so these are probably not appropriate for new players (party setting). However, other game modes, such as Arcade and Versus are more friendly to casual or inexperienced players, allowing for a great party experience. Furthermore, you can play on both keyboard and controller at the same time. It is even possible for two people to share one controller (would not recommend) or keyboard. The developers really thought about making this game as accessible as possible.
, 2 offers a few that I appreciate:











Both Overcooked! games are great but I recall enjoying the first game more. The new features introduced in 2 were welcome but sometimes flawed and unnecessary. Somehow the fewer gimmicks and simpler levels (for the most part) in 1 made for a more fun experience. Regardless, I enjoyed Overcooked! 2 as a whole; it is still the chaotically fun co-op experience that I’ve come to expect and love from the Overcooked! Series. Looking forward to 3!",Recommended,93,8

As a returning player: 6/10, for those new to the series: 9/10. Review will be from the first perspective.

Being quite familiar with the first game, my partner and I were super excited for more cooking chaos but ultimately we didn't feel the game is worth the money. The first three/four worlds we 3-starred everything on our first try just from familiarity with the game, the throwing mechanic has a lot of potential and the Kevin levels were a lot of fun but in the end it feels like we only got about 12 levels of actual difficulty.

Overcooked 2 was the time to add in a level editor, not switches on the world map (what are those even for, anyway?). Make the game replayable, maybe a new game+ that you can select at the start if you're familiar with OC already/unlocked at the end of story that changes up the base game. OC2 isn't a sequel, it's just the definitive version of OC1.",Recommended,104,5

Overcooked 2 is not a mere game. It's a crucible of human endurance, a battlefield of the mind, and a culinary odyssey into the heart of madness. This is not a game; it is a lifestyle choice. A commitment. A calling. The moment Overcooked 2 was unleashed upon the world, consciousness itself ascended to a higher plane.

The kitchens are not stages; they are sacrificial altars where innocent ingredients are slaughtered in the name of a higher power. The chefs are not characters; they are vessels of pure, unfiltered aggression, their movements a frenzied dance with death. The orders are not requests; they are demands, the unholy commands of a cosmic overlord.

To play Overcooked 2 is to become a god. Your hands, once mere appendages, are transformed into instruments of creation and destruction. With each dish plated, you are forging the destiny of humanity. The symphony of chaos that erupts in your kitchen is a microcosm of the Big Bang, a violent, beautiful birth of something new.

The graphics? A blasphemous deception, a cruel trick played on the senses. For beneath that veneer of childish charm lies a hyper-realistic simulation of the human soul under extreme pressure. The characters are not cartoon cutouts; they are archetypes of the human condition, struggling against the tide of entropy.

Overcooked 2 is not a game. It is a religion. Its followers are a chosen people, destined to lead humanity into a new era of enlightenment. We are the prophets of chaos, the high priests of the onion. And we shall not be denied.

What a cute fun game to play with your family and friends! Overcooked returned with many new features and the most highlighted one is online multiplayer! Yes, you can play now with your online friends, unlike the first game which only supports local co-op/PVP. We are back to Onion Kingdom and must help to defend it from the hoards of The Unbread. (undead) The story is fun and cute, and the stages are more challenging than before, you also keep unlocking new recipes that require you and your friends to team up or yell and shout during the whole stage. I had so much fun playing it with my friend and sister.


The artwork is fun, you'll have so many chefs to choose from and unlock the more you advance into the game. The map is huge, each chapter has multiple stages and each stage has a unique challenge, besides the DLC's which adds even more contents. There are also Kevin's the dog, stages where you have to cook and serve dog food! those are really hard to make!


The soundtracks are nice, fitting the gameplay, nothing too loud. I played this game using a controller, not sure if it can work as smoothly with a keyboard. The trophies are a bit challenging and need some grinding, but what makes this fun is when you play it with your friends, you wouldn't feel that you are grinding for anything. You can team up with total of four players together.


Pros:
+Beautiful visuals and locations design.
+Fun Soundtracks.
+Unique gameplay
+Multiple Chefs.
+Bonus stages.
+Huge map and many stages to play.
+New Game+ unlocks an additional star to earn and difficulty.
+Seasonal free content + paid DLCs.
+Local and online multiplayer.
+Many recipes (You unlock more as you advance into the game).
+Steam achievements.

Cons:
-When you fall down into the sea, the game freezes for everyone for a couple of seconds until the player respawn.

After finishing the main game, you'll unlock a new challenge and that will require you to get a fourth star in each stage! The developers still bringing new content and adding more recipes. With the new Holiday free update, you get to feed angry hoards and defend your kitchen at the same time! I highly recommend it for people who enjoys multiplayer challenging games.",Recommended,73,30

I feel bad leaving a bad review as I'm sure the developers put a lot of effort into it and I appreciate what the game is trying to offer. However as a big fan of the first one I can't help but point out some huge problems with the second one that have kept me from enjoying it.

Overcooked is at its best when you are figuring out how to solve the level efficiently given the layout of the level in front of you. You make a plan, divide tasks, and refine your execution until your team is a well oiled machine. Then you move on to the next level and do it again.

It's at its worst when the levels are built to slow you down or irritate you. Not particularly challenging, just clunky. You end up standing around a lot. You often have to wait for platforms to reappear or to get to you. There's nothing you can do to speed it up. I'm cool with dynamic levels that force you to adapt, but not when you end up just standing around waiting for the level shifts to occur. The first game's levels felt like they were asking the question ""can you find an efficient way to get things done here?"" This time around the levels are asking ""can you find a way to get anything done here at all?""

I think they knew the levels were clunky and made the scoring system very forgiving to compensate, because we got 3 stars on almost every level the first time through. I know they're releasing a NG+ so maybe the difficulty will change, but going back and replaying levels is not that appealing of a proposition due to the level design I described above. I am hoping future patches fix this game. The foundation is solid, some new levels and appropriate difficulty would solve everything.

If you are considering this game and haven't played the first one, I suggest buying that one instead. It is far less polished, but the design is on point.",Not Recommended,402,15

This game is hell.
Some levels are pretty creative, easy and fun to play while others require a f*cking hive mind and psychic powers to complete. I swear, we couldn't complete a level on three stars until we got a fourth person. Getting a certain amount of stars makes you unlock new chefs, so if you are feeling desperate - just forget about this god forsaken star.

If you like cooking, swearing and shouting at your friends for two minutes straight, then enjoy. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you don't have at least two friends who are willing to play with you. Seriously. But don't tell them about the damage that can be done to their nervous system.

P.S. Completing the story unlocks mode for all levels - the fourth star, the score for obtaining which is sky-high. Good luck and god save us all.",Recommended,88,0

Fun until you realize your significant other has put rice on tortillas and you've been putting meat on tortillas and now you cant mix them. Next thing you know she's not talking to you anymore, and she's cutting up tomatoes like a mad woman and throwing them everywhere. You don't speak the same to each other for several days after this.
Don't mess up the tortillas people.

In all fairness, this game is super fun to play, and I loved every second of it, even the arguments. If you're not the kind of player that needs to go for full stars on all levels, then you shouldn't really have many of these playing with others anyway. Arguments are inevitable in this game normally, unless you're super in sync with your partner, or one person takes full charge of all situations and the other just takes orders and takes no charge or no initiative at all. Initiative can fail levels (even a little bit). I've heard from most people that this game can be frustrating and causes fights, but depending on who you play it with, it might be a good fit for you and someone else, or multiple people, but the difficulty scales with more people, so beward of that.

This review is 100% based on the co-op aspect of the game. Although you can play it single player, it's a completely different experience. Preparing ingredients takes much longer and you control 2 people, switching between both of them, there is no ""single chef mode"". I don't really recommend the game for the single player.

------------------------------
Control Scheme I Used:
Gamepad, default bindings. Mostly used D-Pad for quickness, but used both.

------------------------------
Worth the current price (CDN$ 28.99 + $22.79 + $6.69)? Definitely a bit high for all content but probably worth it. When it's all added up however it's a bit much.

What I actually paid: $58.47, I paid full price, which is rare for me. I bought the game and the DLCs right when they came out. I loved the first game so much this wasn't an issue for me.

------------------------------
Completionist Review:
DLC Achievements: Yes there is, for each pack.
Rating: Somewhat grindy, most fine if you're good.
Can be completed in one run: If you beat all levels first try, no.
Chapter Select: You can replay any level, clearly tells you your score, and what's missing.
Did I need/use a guide? No, I used a guide to clarify that some of the achievements are a bit misworded however, but not to actually help with getting the achievements.

Achievements are not overly hard if you're good at the game, can be completed single player also, but it's quite difficult. Many achievements are a bit grindy, and require doing 100-500 of something, which by the way many people have counted including myself to require much much more than the actual amount it says it requires. Most of the grindy achievements have to be done afterwards since there isn't enough levels to get them on normal playthroughs, unless you replay (or fail, but it's unclear if this counts) the levels a lot.",Recommended,116,2

Dear Overcooked 2,

Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as a sous chef with Overcooked 2. My last day will be Today.

Thank you so much for the opportunity to work in this position for the past 6 hours. I’ve greatly enjoyed and appreciated the opportunities I’ve had to suffer thropugh campaign levels 5-5 and 6-2 respectively. I’ve learned that i would rather stick my head in the deep fryer than play these 2 levels again, which I will take this experience with me throughout my career.

During my last two seconds, I’ll do everything possible to wrap up my duties and train other team members. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help during the transition.

I wish the company continued success, and I hope to stay in touch in the future.

Sincerely,
Me

There are these like secret ""Kevin"" levels
Tons of new recipes, sushi and stuff

Bought the game for full price + DLC

Pros:
Really, really fun to play with friends!
Stars are adjusted to number of players playing
Graphics and soundtrack are great
Addition of the new 4th star is a wonderful challenge (3 stars is easy)
Save files and achievements work properly (as of 190219)


Cons:
Boring to play by self
Lack of workshop? Was hoping to get custom maps to extend the gameplay
Some lag for friends who connect (still an issue in 190219)

Overall not a bad purchase, definitely caused a lot of frustration and yelling but it is very addictive!",Recommended,51,0

It's a fun enough game, but level 5-6 had screen distortion effects that induced nausea/motion sickness.

There's no way to skip levels, and the only solution I could find was turning down the resolution, which didn't work.

Unfortunately this basically just makes the game unplayable for those who suffer from this, as there's no dedicated way to turn off these effects.

Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you about Overcooked! 2 - the game that made me feel like a professional chef one minute, and a total idiot the next.

From the moment I started playing, I knew I was in for a wild ride. The game requires you to work with your friends to cook up a storm in a kitchen that's constantly changing and evolving. And let me tell you, it's a recipe for disaster - in the best possible way.

I found myself frantically chopping vegetables, throwing ingredients at my fellow chefs, and trying not to set the kitchen on fire. It's like a cooking game on steroids, with insane challenges that had me laughing and screaming at the same time.

But the real fun started when I played with my friends. Suddenly, we were all shouting at each other, trying to coordinate our movements and figure out who was responsible for what. It was chaos, but it was the most hilarious chaos I've ever experienced.

And the best part? The game doesn't take itself too seriously. From the ridiculous character designs to the over-the-top kitchen settings, Overcooked! 2 is a game that's all about having fun.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a game that will have you laughing until you cry, then Overcooked! 2 is the game for you. It's a cooking game that's equal parts fun and challenging, and it's guaranteed to bring out your inner chef (or your inner disaster chef, at least). So gather up your friends, grab some snacks, and get ready for the wildest cooking adventure of your life!",Recommended,29,1

I worked at a Wendy's in high school. It was not good. I got no money, didn't have fun and the food sucked. 15 years later I got Overcooked 2. I thought it would be like Wendy's all over again. I couldn't have been more wrong.

This game is so good. I played through the full campaign and three starred every level. I laughed the entire time, it was a genuine joy to play.

After beating the last level I was greeted with a message that there's now FOUR STARS to unlock on each level. Heck yeah! Sign me up!

Me and my friends tried to four star THE TUTORIAL and didn't come even close. Like, not even remotely. I was sad.

All in all, I laughed, I cried, I came. Sometimes all at the same time! Kevin is great, Onion King is a thirst trap and my friends have all agreed to never attempt four starring any level because we aren't that good. But it's still better than Wendy's for sure.",Recommended,35,0

I am a 54 year old mother, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single mother to my son, who is now 15. My son recently started Overcooked in less than a week, he had already played for over 12 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories! 😊",Recommended,81,0

Happiness, contentment, glee, felicity, bliss, enjoyment.

You will find none of this here.

Only pain, misery, suffering and misanthropy. And you will still love every second of it, while you laugh and want to murder your friends at the same time. Highly recommended for co-op, just be ready to get new friends afterwards since they don't belong in the necessary hive-mind to accomplish the tasks.


On a more serious note, the game is quite fun and have plenty of levels with interesting variations and gimmicks. There's never a dull moment and the pacing is good. It seems to be more balanced to 2 and 4 people than 3, and dropping objects is a herculean ordeal and the game would be two times better if they made it easier.

Team17 should be notorious for making Overcooked's lackluster updates into PAID CONTENT. The new maps should be an update, not sold as a DLC (I believe the content is not worth the price as you already paid $30 for the game). I think those who say, ""well, you don't have to buy the DLC"" - are naive people. How would you feel if you went to a restaurant (keeping w/ the theme) and ordered the entire dinner set for $80? Only to realize, the dessert is an add on, utensils are an add on, and etc. My main point is, new content should be the norm. Cosmetics - sure, make them DLC, free, in-game purchases, microtransactions, I do not care. Just not game updates.

Additional arguments:
1) Overcooked (OC) released w/ no online multiplayer. In order to play w/ others online - you would have to purchase the NEW OC2.

2) More recently, OC2 and OC All You Can Eat are not compatible. The person w/ OC2 has to buy, essentially ANOTHER copy of OC2.

I wholeheartedly enjoy the Overcooked franchise, but someone needs to say something.",Not Recommended,35 people found this review helpful 0,0

It's probably the best widely available local coop game out there, and on top of that it's regularly upated. Supporting split controllers and keyboards doesn't even require a lot of preparation for a bigger company of four. Though there can be so much going on that it's better to start from beginning of campaign, since even for a casual game difficulty can spike before you really notice, but in score requirements for progression are lowered compared to Ovecooked 1. Beyond that, it's mostly about how player company can start cooperating (which is wonderful for the genre), and all that cooking chaos is a colorful background.",Recommended,19 people found this review helpful 2,0

I 3 starred every mission within around 6 hours of game time, and honestly, it would have been faster if every second mission I didn't have to alt+F4 because the game failed to load missions and froze on the loading screen. Also, the last mission of the game was pretty lackluster and probably one of the easiest missions in the game to 3 star. I did most of the game, earning a score on most missions of approximately 2x the required amount for 3 stars and only a few missions required a 2nd try to get full star rating. When playing multiplayer, there were several lag spikes, to the point my friends froze in place for about 30 seconds, multiple times. On the note of multiplayer, only the host earns achievements, chefs, and any sort of progress. I wish the unbread made more of an appearance rather than the odd points on the world map and the beginning cutscene. It is a good, fun game, but not worth the full asking price. Quite disappointing especially coming from the first game expecting it to be better, like a sequel should be.",Not Recommended,57,0

TLDR
Overcooked 2 is a massive improvement over overcooked 1 and still delivers the culinary co-op madness.

Non-TLDR
Overcooked 2 (ovc 2 in short) is developed by Ghost Town Games Ltd. and Team17 Digital Ltd. It is published by Team17 Digital Ltd. The PC version was released on Aug 8, 2018 and it is also available on PlayStation 4, Switch & Xbox One. As of this writing, Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/overcooked!-2) shows:
A Metascore of 80 from 6 critics review
an average user score of 7.7 based on 32 ratings

I am not going to address the obvious question: Does the sequel of the beloved 2016's overcooked live up to the expectation?

Instead, i'll be asking you: Are you one of those people who is confused by all the comments you read on reddit/metacritic/steam reviews/forums/etc and is on the fence whether to purchase overcooked 1 or 2 because of all the contradicting feedbacks? I totally understand what you are going through and I can only say, it's not the product's fault. its the people. They are causing all this Fuss over one of the BEST couch co-op/co-op product in the history of gaming/current market (Well, at least as of this writing in the year 2020).

Once again, the onion kingdom needs saving. This time around, onion king accidently summons a horde of unbread. *gasp* So thats where players come in. The objective is to serve the food while overcoming different challenges/obstacles presented in each level. That's easier said than done.

Play up to 4 players via local or internet multiplayer. The campaign offer players 6 worlds@regions to explore with a total of 36 levels and 8 Kevin levels that needs to be unlocked. Aside from the campaign mode, Versus mode is still available and there's an Arcade mode now. Once you complete the entire campaign, you will unlocked 4 star mode. Play with your food chefs!

If that's not enough to satisfy your culinary experience, there are currently 5 DLC's available for purchase and a new free DLC coming up in July 2020.

Controls: WASD keyboard and controller. Keyboard key binding is not available.

Audio: The background music sets the mood and tempo for the game. Different background music will be played in different world/region (similar like ovc 1) Every player action has feedback sound; dash, chop, throw ingredients, fire, falls, etc. everything. +1 to the team

Visuals: The overall concept is still similar with ovc 1: simple, colorful, clean and plain looking (does not have details in the costume/looks) however I find that ovc 2's color to be more . Aside from that, we have a lot more new cooks to pick from; eagle, mouse, octopus, beaver and etc. +1 to the team

This is a major section to cover. The dev's expanded on the existing mechanics & level design of ovc 1. They really up their game with some of these changes. The notable ones:






These are just from the base game. If you own the DLC's theres even more creative/weird stuffs; moving around the kitchen via cannons, water squirt guns to wash dishes, backpacks to pick ingredients from, Marshmallows, hot dogs, drinks, milk shakes and more..

Looking just at ovc 2, base product (excluding the dlc's) overall, it ""feels"" as if ovc 2 is more polished than ovc 1. The level design is more creative - where it forces players to do more/interact/react more as compared to ovc 1 which makes the game feel more intense. Does that mean it's more difficult?



I am highlighting this because , overcooked games will always be coach co-op/co-op centric product that tries to make you have fun with friends/people. It is dark souls.

The fact that the devs made ovc 2 to allow players to make some mistakes/blunders and still manage to obtain 3 stars is to cater for the general audience. From young kids to adults, from casuals to hardcores. Each one of us have different preferences. I dont want to play with 4 perfectionist players. It's stressful. I also dont want to play with 4 jokers. it's crap. ovc 2 offers that balance. Those jokers will never be able to obtain 3 stars - or what if they do? or what if some of us can play or cannot play as good as but still be able to obtain 3 stars. Whats so damaging? Is there any harm to lower the skill ceiling? to the community? to the mass market? or it's just your pride and ego? or your butt?

So, coming back to ovc 2, i expected the devs to build on ovc 1 mechanics what i did not expect is to this degree of change. It is a massive amount of effort and one that i have to applaud to all the teams involved in the production of ovc 2. The DLC's are great addition but also very challenging/brutal experience.

If there's any negative point(s), i am slightly disappointed that they took out the rats and blackout levels from ovc 1. Yes, those were really annoying levels but I have some fond memories from there. I was also really hoping for a final boss, but what i got was a defense game mode. But as a whole, the product offers more positives than cons.

So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for overcooked 2 is a Crispy Golden Taco worth 9/10.

I would definetly recommend Overcooked 2 if online coop could also share progress and chefs unlocks, since it is mainly meant to be played in multiplayer and this seems like a major flaw to me that if you have played with someone online, then dropped down, if you want to play it again you have to start all over. If this changes i will change my vote right away, since the game itself is really cool, with new features like the dash and the toss, while still keeping increasingly challenging levels.
EDIT : Since the update, progress is shared so it makes sense again, so i recommend the game of course :)",Recommended,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0,4

Overcooked 2 is a hectic co-op game where you play a chef, cooking a variety of recipes in a variety of crazy kitchens. You'll have to cooperate with your teammates to fill orders in time and collect enough points to pass through the levels. It's very similar to the first game, but there are a number of improvements to it, including online co-op and some small improvements in the controls.

This game can be played with up to four players. I think you can play alone, but I can't imagine it being all that enjoyable. The fun really comes from playing the levels with your friends and figuring out the best way to run your kitchen efficiently. I've played the game with 2, 3, and 4 players before, and while some of the levels are best suited to one particular number of players, I think all of the levels are playable even with just two players.

Story mode has a variety of levels to play through, although it really isn't very long. However, there are a variety of other goals to complete as well. There are 4 stars to collect on each level, there are a few other game modes to try, and there are a number of bonus levels as well which are still being added to. I also think the levels are incredibly fun to replay even without much new content.

I love the art style and the music. It's all very cute and rounded. The chefs you can unlock are all very cute, with a variety of different people, animals, and other creatures to choose from. The background music is nice to listen to and well-suited to the game. The story in story mode is pretty bare bones, but it's fine, a game like this doesn't really need an amazing story.

The DLC in the game is worth buying, but not necessary. There is a ton of content and replay value to the base game, especially with the occasional free updates, and the DLC is all self-contained. However, each DLC adds new recipes and level mechanics, and the DLC levels all have replay value of their own.

Overall, Overcooked 2 is a great game to play with your friends. I've had a lot of fun playing the game with various friends and will probably continue to come back to the game over time. If you don't have people to play with (in-person or online with voice chat), you can probably skip it, but otherwise I'd highly recommend it. 10/10",Recommended,18,0

Finished the game in almost 6 hours. My wife and I were really excited about this game having played through the first one many times over. We will keep playing in case we're just judging this too soon, but so far this is a disappointment compared to the first one. My wife is a professional game designer, and we spent a lot of time just picking apart details and poor executions, which was kind of sad :( the story mode map was just made unnecessarily more complicated and brings nothing extra to the game. In fact it's annoying. We were excited to finish and switch to arcade mode so we didn't have to mess with the map, but arcade mode didn't appear to display our previous scores, so we didn't know what to beat. The levels are either poorly balanced, or we just haven't figured out a good strategy for each yet. The levels have so many little things that get in your way, though, that we often didn't want to replay a level to perfect it. They just were not that fun. In the first game, we would finish a level and be like ""awesome! We can do better! Let's try that again!"" That sadly just didn't happen in OC2. Some levels change 2 or 3 times throughout--the first game did this, but in that one the dynamic levels never seemed out of place like they do in OC2. We would have happily paid for more content in the first game with similar philosophies in level design.

To be honest we're not that surprised. So many good games make you think, ""wow this is great, I hope when they make the next one they understand what makes this one so good and don't mess it up.""

My advice: If you are looking at this game for the first time, just go get the first one instead.",Not Recommended,46 people found this review helpful 0,6

Overcooked 2 is a fantastic game, far superior to the previous edition, and utter chaotic fun with friends. Bringing Online Play to the table, Overcooked 2 already is an immense improvement from Overcooked.

The level designs are creative, diverse, challenging and great fun. The level requirements themselves or time constraints can be difficult at times, but overall a great experience, and I deeply enjoyed 100%ing this one with my friend.

Didn't cause any rage or arguments or even general burnout for us, but I think that's largely because it's overexaggerated for comedy how difficult the game is. Mostly you'll be laughing or too focused on your tasks at hand to think of anything toxic.

Tons of character options, tons of themes/levels/foods, and tons of DLC that only enhance the experience and are also very worthwhile to purchase. Additions to the game only need to be purchased by one person for the whole party to experience them as well. Along with the expected levels, the game also features tower-defense that breaks up the flow in a much needed way.

I can see myself playing this game for dozens of more hours, and my only qualm is that I wish the online matchmaking was more active. However, if you're already have someone in mind, you've nothing to lose.:) I strongly recommend this one, full price or not.",Recommended,15,0

For new players this could seem a good couch game with interesting gameplay....
For those, who're a bit familiar with the original game, this one will be a total disappointment. Overcooked! was an incredible place to use teamplay and develop strategies to beat challenging levels. This one is all about chaotic running throughout maps full of dynamic motley things and getting 3 stars in the end even if you fail a lot.

Just finished the campaign with my wife. All missions apart from secret levels with 3 stars. It is way easier than the first game, we actually had no challange at all. We completed the last mission, supposedly a bossfight, with 3 stars on first try with no effort. Then the game made us watch credits which i couldn't skip so i quit the game and my progress didn't save. The game is lacking any novelty, apart from several new recipes, dashing and throwing it's all the same, but easier. Almost no UI improvements were done, there's no quick way to restart levels, you have to come back to the centre of the map after each area to hear another boring part of the story. Don't get me wrong, the mechanics are still very fine, the core of the game is really fun, we enjoyed our playtrough, but we feel a lot of disappointment as well. In my opinion the game is not worth its price at the current level. I expected more from a sequel.

While the game never strays too far from the 1st installment of the series, it doesn't manage to evolve following the same brilliant path of the first one.

Quality is good, graphics fancied up (and got a bit less readable too), a few interesting actions were added (throwing items, water pistol, etc) and it has loads of new recipes, but always feels more like an expansion of the 1st one than a full sequel. In a way that's no problem, we loved the 1st one (yeah, I am another one of those that did play it with his girlfriend) and we couldn't way to play more of it, even if it didn't add much stuff.

What falls short compared to the 1st one is level design and balancing. The 1st one was a gem in that sense, with each level absolutely well tuned and requiring to be played multiple failing times until -bam!- you could get 3 stars.
Overcooked 2 levels tend to be far too easy in general (the surf'n'turf DLC is far better balanced), using map dangers more as an obstacle than as part of the complexity (e.g. the leves where you can fall).

Then comes the 4th star, and it's close to unachievable in terms of difficulty.
One really bad side of the new visuals, if you have multiple food items on a surface perpendicular to the screen surface (""vertical""), it's impossible to understand what's where and what spaces are free.

All in all a pleasant game to play, but could have probably evolved much better than how it did. Still got a 75/100 in my books, and I do recommend playing the Surf'n'turf DLC.",Recommended,19,0

I've played this game a lot... like, a lot a lot since buying it around 6 weeks or so ago. It can be an absolute load of fun at times. Other times, you get to deal with trolls, leavers, racists, and people that are just setting out to ruin the game. Unfortunately, the admins and developers of this game are those same people.

These admins are willing to ban your account (mind you, in a game that ENCOURAGES YOU TO BE SOCIAL AND DECEIVE) for next to nothing at all, while not even providing their users with a clear set of rules. When I asked the admin why I was banned, he said that I should check out the forums. Why should a player have to check the forums for such a thing? Why is there not in-game explanations of their rules, and why when violating those rules, are players NOT EVEN TOLD WHY. I've received no emails, no messages, no chat description of what happened --- simply banned. It isn't acceptable, especially in a game like this.

In a recent patch, the devs implemented a system for players to upvote others that played well, were friendly, or ""FOR ANY REASON YOU CHOOSE TO UPVOTE THEM"". This has led to ""FRIENDS"", and groups people, instantly blasting through the ""ranks"" that are associated with one's behavior. Despite playing with 1 friend during about 1 hour of playing, I still ended up with max rank after less than a week or so. However, this has NO effect on them banning you, despite THEM suggesting it represents you being a good representative of the community.

At this point, I'll be selling my in-game items on the marketplace and moving on.

Words of advice to these devs: Transparency with your plans, your systems, and your choices is key... get better at this and I'll consider playing the game in the future when it is likely dead or free.",Not Recommended,972,0

The report and rating system of the game is too strict. Just because you are a traitor and finished off the survivors doesn't mean you should get reported cuz they don't like you.

I had wanted to play this game for years, seeing it on youtube. A combination of finances and friend groups didn't allow me to get the game until very recently. We had a great time playing, but after a few games the developers implemented an update that I am sure killed the game. There is an integration of ToxMod. For those fortunate not to know what this horrible ""feature"" is, allow me to enlighten you: ToxMod is an AI algorithm which records your voice chat without consent in order to censor its own playerbase. Even private games are recorded, and anything that this team deems ""innappropriate"" can get you banned. Not only this, but ToxMod as a company is looking to impliment a system where you have a social credit score across all games, and if you are flagged in one title with ToxMod you will be more closely watched and recorded in all other games that choose to use this horrible software. Overall, I would like to think this move was made with good intentions, to help make a more enjoyable community around their game that required years of hard work to make. However, this blunder has alienated its already sparse playerbase and is, in my opinion, overstepping their authority and boundaries/responsibilities as a developer. I wish I could say I was hopeful for the future of this game, but now this game is officially dying. Sad to see it go, and so soon after I bought it.",Not Recommended,255,24

I played the free weekend I and Immediately purchased the game. It's super fun with friends obviously, but even with randoms I still enjoyed/enjoy the game.

People are complaining they die and the combat is garbage. Just hold down the left click to hit harder with melee and aim longer to line up shots better. It's honestly that simple, but anyway, besides people getting mad at that point. People are also saying it is one-sided and the Traitors are OP. Not really, It takes serious communication with your partner as a Traitor and are outnumbered 2 : 6. As an Innocent, If you aren't brain dead and go off with two random people (even if they're friends) you probably won't be killed. My best advice is to stay in groups and never go with less than 4 people at a time unless you know for sure they aren't a Traitor and can prove it on the spot.


Furthermore, it's hard to tell who the Traitors are with randoms but that's part of the fun. Sadly however, If you are close with your friends and can't lie very easily then you're screwed. But, it's fun regardless, even as a Ghost you can still help the Innocent team (or screw them over with cold) and even being dead you get bonus points if they end up escaping. If every game you die and say, ""Oh I am dead, screw it I am going back to the main menu"". Then don't download this game, you're far too selfish to enjoy a team-based game like this.",Recommended,195,11

This game used to be incredible. There were a lot of unique and interesting roles, all with their own identity and playstyles. Survivors could go off on their own and risk getting picked off or be slower together and have more safety. Traitors could blend in with Survivors and cause mayhem internally or go off on their own to get stronger. There were hackers (ingame role) that could open a bunker every 5 minutes, there was a medic that could see the healthbar of people around them and revive downed people around them with an AoE, there was a scientist that could revive someone that fully died, and so on. All of these roles also had an 'evil' equivalent that would allow the bad guys to act like one of them. The game had quite powerful roles, but it felt good getting them.

Sadly, the scientist and medic have been removed from the game, hacker has been nerfed to the ground, reviving a dead person is a joke to do, survivor wolfing (going alone to be useful to the team, added social deception because you would have to explain yourself) straight up got removed, traitors going alone to get stronger has seen multiple nerfs, and I can't honestly say this even closely resembles the game I fell in love with and easily dumped 600 hours into in less than a year. Too many patches have chipped away fun mechanics, roles and playstyles over the years.

If you're new to this game and never experienced the imo 'good' Project Winter, you might enjoy this game, even if you have nobody in your friends group to play it with. The basics and community really are there for a great, unique and awesome survival social deception game. But to me, who has seen the very best this game had to offer, and has had so many incredible, fun and memorable moments on it, seeing it in its current state, and knowing that devs like the direction the game is currently going, I absolutely cannot recommend this game.",Not Recommended,97 people found this review helpful 7,5

I saw with my own eyes that my friend was killed because another survivor thought he opened the traitor's box. in my deepest heart I was very happy to see it because I was actually the traitor. without effort and thinking hard, this game will be easy, I thought, but wrong, when there are only 3 survivors remaining the game becomes difficult and complicated. I have to think hard about how to kill 2 other survivors without suspicion. With the last effort, I finally cooked poisonous animal meat and was eaten by myself to dispel my friend's suspicions. And it works. Other survivors become confused again and distrust each other. A survivor in the last seconds became a crazy psycho rampage, he shot us all without common sense. Finally, because we do not trust one another, we fight, hitting each other with barehands [me the traitor], pickaxe [survivor A] and shotguns [survivor B] ... until the blizzard comes violently to hit us all.

Joined a public match that had one of the moderators of the game in it. All he was talking about was how he can ban people. For about several games he would gloat about his authority. A player didn't fully understand the mechanics of the game and got frustrated when he thought he was being trolled. Instead of the moderator explaining how the game is played to the player, the moderator just ridiculed and provoked the player even more and then threatened to ban him. After the match was over and the player left, the moderator asked the lobby if he should give the player a 24 hour ban or a 48 hour ban. It was awkward, uncomfortable, and unprofessional.

Game is fun.. playing with the moderator was not...

I had a fantastic time in the games I played, the community is lovely and the game is very well designed, but I played maybe 3 games total due to how few and far between lobbies were, at some points in the day I couldn't find a single lobby, in any region, I often waited either on the menu or in a lobby for longer than I actually played the game. This isn't a problem if you're happy to wait, or if you have friends to play it with, or if you fancy joining a discord that operates around the game, but if you're just interested in the idea and are buying it for yourself to play with strangers, maybe give this one a skip until the player base improves.",Not Recommended,123,4

If you like Among Us, Secret Hitler or a similar game but feel like they could use a little more depth as well as more actual gameplay outside of the discussions you might want to give this game a try.

Project Winter puts six survivor players in a winter survival setting and expects them to cooperate to overcome hunger, freezing temperatures, hostile animals and the two traitor players. The survivors goal is to escape the area before the game ending blizzard starts. They do that by fixing multiple machines in the area, some of which first need to be located in the randomly generated game world, and then calling and reaching the escape vehicle.

The biggest difference to Among Us is that you will be using voice chat throughout the entire round, however you'll only be able to speak to nearby players or remote players if you and them use the same walkie talkie. This adds a lot of the overall atmosphere and suspense and also helps make the rounds feel more meaningful compared to Among Us. Cooperating with someone from the beginning of the round and overcoming all the obstacles to barely make it out alive in the end actually feels like it really helps you bond with them.

With the game incorporating survival, crafting and combat elements as well as player roles with their own unique abilities it's quite a bit more complex and therefore requires you to play a couple rounds in which you will probably feel clueless and lost before you get the hang of things. Keep that in mind if you want to convince friends to play the game with you, as they will need to be willing to put some effort into getting into the game before they can fully enjoy it. For your first few games try to stay alive, gather resources and ask the group how you can contribute.

If you put in the effort to learn the game it's very rewarding and fun to play. As with other similar games being able to recognize the traitors among the group of survivors is invaluable, but unlike other games even a sole survivor can have a lot of agency by playing cleverly. Survivors can fight back when they're being attacked by traitors, and similarly they can use traps that traitors normally use to defend fixed objectives from being sabotaged. There are countless ways to contribute to the team's progression and similarly there are countless ways to pretend you're helping when you're actually hindering progress. You can play a very aggressive and obvious traitor, or you can seem trustworthy for most of the game and only reveal your true nature in the very end, both ways and anything in between can lead to a win. This is where the game truly shines, as it helps rounds to never really play out like the ones before.

Something to keep in mind before buying the game is finding other players. Project Winter doesn't have nearly as many players as Among Us and unless there is a major sale the game is quite a bit more expensive, which might make it hard to convince friends to buy it. You will definitely have the best time with the game if you can gather 8 friends to play, who all already know the game, but unlike with Among Us, where I feel like public lobbies rarely lead to good games, Project Winter's community has decent public lobbies. While not every public game you'll play will be amazing, I found the chance to have a good game joining public lobbies to be pretty good and the nature of the game makes it easier to make new friends in those lobbies. Either way it's absolutely necessary to point out that depending on your region and time preferences it might not always be easy to find a lobby at all. This is by far the biggest reason not to buy the game.

Overall I highly recommend this game if you’re looking for a more complex social interaction and deduction game with survival elements and if you know you can find people to play with.

It's a fun game if the people you play with are cool. Don't get me wrong, I understand every game has idiots that wanna ruin it for everyone. But the thing is with most online games you either have options to solo it or can effectively ignore the people you don't want to listen to. In this game this is simply not possible as teamwork and communication is absolutely essential to the game play.

Now normally this isn't a problem for me as I love team focused games. But after a few games where I was bullied off or I saw someone else get bullied off (for being new to the game), I just wasn't having fun. All the players that did the bullying were all supposedly ""well reviewed"" players too. In the time I played I only met one other player who was helpful and taught me how to play. Unfortunately, players like that are the exception not the rule, and most people will kill you if you don't know what you're doing. On top of that, the tutorial really only skims the surface and doesn't teach you nearly enough to get started.

That being said the fun games I did have were really fun and I had a blast playing as a traitor. Getting people to trust you and then betraying that trust is incredibly rewarding. Unfortunately, this also makes people inherently suspicious. That combined with the crap tutorial means that often times, asking for help means you are automatically treated like an outcast. This makes it extremely difficult for new players to get started. In my very first game, I got confused by what button to press and was immediately cut down by someone who called me a time wasting troll. I kept playing because I saw the potential, but it did sour my experience and made me suspicious of all players from that point on.

And before you say ""just go on youtube"". Well, not everyone wants to watch an hours worth of video before jumping into a game. I did, but I know many people don't want to do that. They just want to jump in and play after an informative tutorial. But to each their own.

All in all between the trolls, time wasters, racists, and random sexual harassment I've witnessed a female friend go through, it's just not really worth it for me personally. I play games to have fun, not to be insulted for being new or Asian or whatever the hell else.

All that said, I would totally reinstall if they added a better rating and report system to help control the bullies and trolls.",Not Recommended,101,9

The ONLY thing that I've seen negative about this game is that the community of players is small. Honestly... that's my favorite part! You really get to know just about everyone in the community. Every time I join a lobby, I see at least one player that I already know. This makes the game so much more fun!

Project Winter Review

TL;DR
In a game of cat and mouse where knowing when to strike effectively and when to communicate with your team (for both traitors and survivors), your best ally is your intuition in Project Winter. The variety keeps the game fun after numerous matches and when all of the elements come together it can be a fantastic experience! While being held down by issues and questionable decisions, it makes up for a good game!

Pros
Cons
Multiple ways to communicate.








The most important aspect in that dictates how matches will play out is communication between the players. As a social game, must work together if they want to survive the harsh conditions of the winter while must coordinate to execute their plans. The game gives several forms to approach communications, each serving a purpose and giving choice to the player. Voice chat is more direct and fast in moments of action while text stays on record and can be used to impersonate other players who are down for the count.



When you first start off the game, it can be very confusing because of both the tutorials and the learning curve. The tutorials are very lacking as they only explain the basics of the game but don't reveal details or how mechanics work, leaving new players wandering in their first matches not knowing what to do. It doesn't help that the gameplay in the game is very chaotic, as there is a lot to keep track of and do to be effective at it.

manages to keep it's gameplay fresh after numerous matches thanks to its variety of roles and the procedure generated maps. Both traitors and survivors have their own roles and each of them is clear and unique in what their objective is. From a tracking and opening an armory to arm fellow survivors to a , that can bring dead players back or a which has betrayed the traitors and can open their crates, they are all a lot of fun to play as.

While this keeps the game fresh, at the same time it massively elevates the learning curve. There are a lot of roles to learn as well as objectives that must be accomplished before a time limit. While the game addresses this by providing a guide on the roles, it doesn't entail how to play them correctly or what the survivors' priorities are. From poisoning food to trapping escape pods with bombs or unlocking the serum lab, there is a lot to learn and sometimes the lack of that knowledge can ruin a game.

One of the best aspects of a game of this nature is that the matches you play will vastly differ thanks to the different players you will encounter. Each player helps define what type of experience you will go through and this makes it very interesting to keep playing. Silent calculating types, charming actors that are traitors, or just funny survivors trying to survive! It makes for a lot of fun and a great opportunity to meet new people or have a fun time with strangers. Bringing friends also makes it even more enjoyable!



That being said in my experience playing with randoms, I didn't enjoy the lobbies with high ranked players so much. This is because once survivors know how to play and coordinate, it can be very difficult for traitors to do anything and it breaks the game's tempo as matches are shorter. Near-perfect communications and knowing what to do in every minute can turn the game into something very competitive and that is finished before it gets interesting which can lead to a letdown.

The strong point in is that is very enjoyable to play when all of the elements come together to form a complete experience. When the players in the lobby make the match interesting and they understand both the mechanics and the game objectives, it can make it a blast to play in those rounds! The high tension of survivors dropping down or being suspected, the uncertainty of not knowing who to trust, and the search for items or situations that can give you an edge enriches the gameplay completely and gives the game a stronger light to shine on.

The weak point of the game is that it suffers from a low player base and to make matters even worse, the DLC splits it even further beyond. Those who lack the DLC of the game cannot be played the new mode introduced in it, which divides the number of people that can play together and makes it much harder to find a lobby at times.

The pacing of the game is well done as there is enough time to get things running but at the same time-wasting, too much time can result in lacking it in the last stretch. A round last between 15-25 minutes and time flies by when you play as the first few minutes are used getting to know people and collecting the basic necessities. As time passes there will be a greater focus on objectives and there will be events to change the essence of the game. From everyone turning to rabbits to teleporting to the middle of nowhere, they provide opportunities for while adding more.



The game runs perfectly on a GTX 1060. There were no crashes of any kind as well. Mechanics can be pretty clunky for example aiming down with a gun is very awkward. Having to hold the trigger to aim while the lines pair up to increase accuracy is a poor indicator as sometimes you can hit others just by shooting directly while other times you line a perfect shot and it misses. It is hard to tell when you will hit and overall is less reliable than using melee weapons at times.

What makes special is that it is a game to have a good time with, just boot it up, get into a lobby and enjoy whatever might happen during it! It is a fun social experience to meet different kinds of players and have a good laugh with them! It can be relaxing at times during gathering but also tense when fellow survivors start dropping or your traitor partner bites the dust! I find it that playing it during the morning is very enjoyable and a good way to talk socialize with people while having fun!

has some issues that hold it down for becoming a better game but for what is set to accomplish it is a solid experience. The steep curve can also be a positive thing for those that enjoy learning as they play for certain and the lack of tutorials paired with the splitting of the player-base can make it harder to enjoy but overall is a good game to grab if you enjoy mind-games and social aspects in gaming! I recommend this game to those that enjoy random moments and unique multiplayer matches!",Recommended,57 people found this review helpful 3,6

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Game is and can be Abused
As of 18.05.2019

While many people have probably had good experiences with this I can accurately say I did not. This is because I have gotten into many games with meta gamers who will not properly try to play the game and instead just try to get each other the most amount of points. They'll simply wait for the ""Bunny Event"" which is no longer random, and will take advantage of it by killing anybody who isn't part of their group, even if they're not a traitor. You can usually tell these people apart because they will have all the yellow gear, which is surprising as of now because even the best player has a hard time earning 1k points per game (as long as you're not a traitor).

They will do this to get rare items which are then used to get rare items and sell on the steam marketplace. This has occured in many other games before, but you would think since there's a history of this the devs would have thought to fix this abuse. There's no which allows these people to carry on taking advantage of the system (and open lobbys) and profiteering from the game which has a broken system.





[/olist]

A few things more things I don't like is you can try to actively play get unlucky and end up with 0 pts earned after 10 min of in game play. It's just not cool to enter a lobby, get in a game, the ""Bunny Event"" occuring and you end up with bad luck and no points. Also a lot of people I have noticed will crash, at least one person per game. For a game centered on player interaction the VOIP is not the greatest.

While I do have a lot of negatives to say about this game there are positives and I am too amped up to really list them, which might make this crueller than it should be. However this game is definitely in a state where it can be abused and it is actively being abused by groups of players and while there is no proper way to manage this I would not trust playing this game.",Not Recommended,184,16

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Don't let the reviews deter you. This is a great game and I plan on doing the review it deserves, if you want a quick run down I'll make a TL;DR in the end.

To start off with the match's progression it usually goes in a linear path:
-Spawn in and see your role
-Investigate what the first objective requires
-Either take the risk path and open bunker or gather resources which will be significantly safer and easier to manage
-Repair the objective
-Find the next objective
-Repair that

However, since the traitors don't feel like losing they alter the game's rhythm rather .



...... The list goes on

The point is every Traitor has many methods on controlling the game's flow. They are easily outnumbered but can quickly gain the upper hand if they kill off too many. .











The player count, reviews, steam, and poor advertising

People's complaints of the game are very deserved but some are completely out of the game's control.


The reason is.... Steam does not support it anymore. All the current pack bundles were grandfathered in.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game has something special, I hope they see how ridiculous it is to charge $20 for it. If you want to in-house with all friends in a full lobby, that's $160 for the group of us to play.

At free or even a lower price, this game would be insanely popular and cosmetics would easily cover costs.

Instead, we have 68 players concurrently and a peak of 202. Like other reviews have stated, getting an 8 player lobby together takes a ridiculously long time.

I'll happily change my review to positive if I see some smart choices on the developers end. I'd even support those choices with my wallet.",Not Recommended,158,7

A video game very similar in feel to the board game dead of winter (a personal favourite). Brilliant fun. Controls are janky, sure. But it's not a battle Royale, and it shouldn't be. As a traitor, set traps, deflect and delay progress. As the survivor, be ever paranoid, keep your eyes on the prize but also on everyone else. I've led people to bears and watched them mauled to death yelling for me to help them as i watch on, to casually finish them off with a sickle afterwards. I've feigned ignorance and distracted from the key task with mundane chores. I've heroically saved a teammate from a bear who then proceeded to backstab me later. I've refused food and been suspicious of people genuinely trying to help me the entire game. You will make friends. They will betray you. You'll leave with more trust issues than your daddy could ever compete with. Highly recommended.",Recommended,54,0

I have mixed feelings for this game. At first I really enjoyed Project Winter, the community was awesome and kind, and the game was a blast to play. However, after it became crossplay, it became a lot more toxic. Admittedly this increased toxicity ruined it for me and I haven't really played much since. I would recommend this game, however, I don't feel like it would accurately represent my current stance.

Here are some issues I came across:

- Although it is better to communicate verbally it opens up an avenue of harassment due to the lack of protective ambiguity for female sounding players, young sounding players, and players with accents. These groups are frequently the targets of harassment and the mic becomes a unfortunate necessity. (There are other options of communication within the game, but the reality is you will usually die first if you don't use a mic.)

- Many were excited for Xbox to join. Crossplay is always something to look forward to, avid players were excited to have more players fill lobbies, and Xbox would give Project Winter more recognition it deserved. After Xbox joined, it unfortunately backfired. There quickly became a keyboard vs controller division. Xbox players used their party chat instead of the in-game chat, PC had an upper hand with ranged weapons, and there was a massive experience gap between new Xbox players and the older PC players at the time. This rift between Xbox and PC was a breeding ground for unpleasant interactions. I hope time has healed this.

- Lastly, There is a social ranking system that is not great, It takes a lot of time and self promotion to get a better rank and one toxic lobby/game can destroy it. In addition, If you have a gold ranking (the top rank), it resets to bronze or red if you are inactive for a month. They have tried fixing it, but in my opinion they should just get rid of it.

With 400+ hours played, I can say this is a fun game. However, the increased toxicity has made this game less enjoyable for me. I do somewhat recommend the game, but I would only recommend playing it with your group of friends.",Not Recommended,67,0

Bought the game a while ago together with friends. During 2020 it has been our favourite game to play during lockdowns, as a mean to stay together (and kill each other ruthlessly ;) ).

The game basics are really easy to grasp (a helpful tutorial is also available) but the deception abilities and attention to details (BE SMART! TAKE YOUR VITAMINS) are keys to become a really skilled player. I suggest to play with your friends for a while before playing with others, but you can always start with unknown players: it will be more difficult in the beginning but after some time you can really make the difference with your team and win.

TIPS:
- LAB: try to always open the Laboratory as soon as you can if you are on the ""good"" side... but also if you are the Traitor, as using the Truth serum on Innocents and accusing them of being evil is a real PRO prove.
- DON'T WANDER ALONE: wild animals, cold and hunger kills too, and Traitors are always there when you are an easy ""prey""
- BEWARE OF THE LONG CON: everyone can be a Traitor, even your chubby-buddy for the entire game.
- PAY ATTENTION TO GHOSTS SIGNALS: dead players will still try to help you differentiate traitors from good fellas, always look for the signs! (e.g. ""Cooling down"" specific players or ""Healing"" everyone)



BLACKOUT: the DLC adds new events, items and a ton of new roles. Playing as a traitor is more challenging (you are alone and need to convert Innocents in bad minions), but it is incredibly worthy (and fun lol) to convert more and more Innocents to your side. RECOMMENDED!

The game is well maintained, with frequent updates, events and new gears. Very active community on Discord, with suggestions and tips for new players, new proposed functionalities, troubleshooting, etc.

Definitely good replay value =)

Old Project Winter was arguably one of the best games ever
For those who don't know what it was like, you missed out
Anyways after an influx of trolls and racists from the game pass, a failed mobile version, cut the price in half, 2 free weekends, lack of updates to the paid DLC, changes to make dead players more powerful, a few gamebreaking bugs and of course, the infamous failed implementation of an anti toxicity software, the game started to slowly die out
I cant even tell you when the last ""real"" update was. The updates nowadays have been really slow, and typically only contain minor bug fixes.

I hate thumbing this down as the main premise of the game is really good and fun. But the main problem like with any traitor and early access multiplayer-only game is, that nobody is playing at Day 2!

It takes forever to play and you have mostly only russians who join, that also refuse to speak english or they team up, even if they are traitor and survivor......

The community doesnt role play and often times it comes down to a death match, where players gun each other down the minute the match started.....no wonder the battle royal genre is so thriving, this generation does not want to cooperate anymore, instead they wanna shoot stuff, mindless and simple.

**Steam only have Yes or No option so I had to put no for now.

Having a group of friends to play with or a very vocal community is nearly a must for this game if not you would not get the full experience.

The game is fun when people do communicate, not when people don't and expect others to read their minds and once they die for being suspicious they start to grief while I do know that this is the norm for any game like this.

There also hardly any lobbies for certain servers for anyone who is playing alone, hopefully this game will get more players. The more populated servers are from Japan and Russia. My ""best"" server is Asia but there is hardly any rooms and even if there is it is in Chinese so had to go to other servers where I will be playing at 200+ ping.

LOVE the idea of the game, but there aren't enough people to play with. There were 20 players online when I attempted to play - waited 20 minutes for my lobby to have enough for a match with no luck.

Price is a huge hurdle for a game that relies on a large player base to exist. At least with SCUM, Rust, or Arc, you can jump on a server to see what the game was about. In Project Winter, you can run around in an interactive lobby, but beyond moving avatars through snow, it's not that interactive.

This was one of the single most disappointing experiences of my gaming life. I absolutely love social-deduction games, like Mafia, Werewolf, Town of Salem, etc. So when I came across this seemingly similar game, with the added twist of cooperative survival and objective-based 3D RPG-style gameplay, I was thrilled!

However, despite the well made game and simplistic (but beautiful) art style, there were several *glaring* flaws which immediately ruined the experience and soured my views on the game. To start, the community is very small and surprisingly toxic for the size. During my second ever game with other people, I was random killed and then asked random game knowledge questions as a 'quiz' which I needed to pass for the other players to pick me up.

Toxicity can be ignored, though. I play League of Legends, I'm used to that. What can't be forgiven, however, is that the current meta within the game is for the Traitors to rush weapons early and then attack and kill everyone. The entire 'social-deduction' aspect of the game vanishes immediately. If you don't rush weapons early, as well, you're easily dispatched by the Traitors, and since the Exile function doesn't do nearly enough to matter, the Traitors maintain a massive advantage throughout the entire game.

I requested a refund after trying to play one or two more games, all of which resulted in the same game flow and same boring, disappointing experience.

This game is really fun and quite enjoyable. I think it's simultaneously been a bit lost and a bit spotlighted due to Among Us's popularity, but don't mistake it for the same game--aside from the fact they are both hidden role games, they share very little in common, and in my opinion, that's for the better.

The game focuses on survival-type gameplay (all players need to keep their health, warmth, and hunger at high enough levels or risk dying) while survivors (innocents) must try to work together to solve objectives and make an escape. Traitors sabotage the innocents, sometimes trying to blend in and other times leaving on their own to gather stronger materials (such as guns, stat-boosting drinks, and traps) to make a more obvious ploy at hunting down the survivors.

More advanced gameplay modes are included as well, with many different roles for both survivors and traitors, bigger maps, etc--as well as entirely new DLC mode called ""Blackout"" (which I find admittedly difficult to understand and play even after maybe 5-10 plays, and which has admittedly fewer lobbies--note that you can't play with anyone who doesn't have the DLC, period).

One small downside that I'll note is that any game with voice chat such as this is going to end up with some downsides. If you have a feminine voice, you may become a target. I've been called slurs multiple times in this game or otherwise harassed. While the majority of public lobbies are friendly, even one nasty player can ruin a game if they want to, and other players rarely step in unless you already know each other.

That being said--it also encourages friendships. I've begun to recognize a few players I've had fun playing with and we often intentionally join each other's lobbies for a bit of fun. It's really difficult to overestimate how much voice chat can spur friendships on more than typical text chat does. Hopefully, this will only become more true as I put more hours into the game!

Overall, definitely reccommend. I think the experience is much better overall for people who have masculine voices, but assuming you're willing to put up with some occasional ♥♥♥♥♥, I think it's fun and worth it.",Recommended,27 people found this review helpful 1,0

It's hard not to write a review without comparing this game to Among Us, but here goes: this social deception game has a lot of depth, and the gameplay loop can vary so widely from game to game. Pubs are great, and the players are really helpful in providing help, guides, and really enjoyable experiences overall. The game scales down surprisingly well to where I'm running it on integrated graphics, and YMMV on that much, but the game is very good and I've had quite a few memorable games that didn't just amount to a win or a loss. That's a key difference between this game and other Mafia, Secret Hitler style games like it: the alt win conditions are great! The neutral roles, I'm a bit more iffy on, but it's hard to deny that they provide a breath of fresh air if the game's meta becomes stale.

Good game and I love deception games. But I saw some game design decisions that drew a red flag.

So first off, instead of making the game Free or cheaper and allowing cosmetics to be bought, the game allows you to purchase them with points you get in the game for doing objectives. This allows people to meta game and point farm and go against the spirit of the game. Someone gets the ""pick up someone 5 times"" objective. You'll just get knocked out 5 times to get picked up rather than a ""I'm going to pick up my fellow survivors to be a good teammate as much as I can this game"" mentality.

Theres no way around multiple people sitting in discord and telling each other that they are the traitor and point farm in the game. The game is for and only probably good for having 8 close friends who will not sabotage your game and break the spirit of it.


Personal Preference= My second concern is just the game doesn't have a good replay value. No two games are the same but only on a social aspect. But then again, if you play with your friends the social aspect will be more of the same unless your friends are master RPers and good at social deduction games. So for $20 USD, I'm not sure you will be getting the most bang for your buck.",Not Recommended,145,0

With games like this, the community is what makes it or breaks it. The community aside, this game is well made and does its job, def worth the money. Including community, it is the best gaming community I have ever played with. So good in fact, a few of us started a discord and have ended up playing all manner of games together outside of Project Winter, forging new and interesting friendships during this unforseen Covid pandemic. Through a bad situation, we found something positive to spend our time on with others with similar interests.

This being said, you will still find the occasional troll, but the rating system is well made enough most games you'll be fine. There is one character that never fails to creep the ever living hell out of everyone he talks to tho and as much as I want to list his name here, I am afraid it is against the rules of writing reviews. But feel free to dm me, and I will warn you. He has made me uncomfortable and I'm not even the women he hits on. I'm just a witness to the poorly attempted flirting.

But again, aside from this one player and the occasional troll, this community is the best I have ever played with which makes this game one of the best I've ever played.

I had a group of about 20-25 people that would play regularily but then we all moved on because they changed the game too much.",Not Recommended,32 people found this review helpful 4,0

The game has proximity, the mechanics are decent, and the objective of the game often keeps players moving and communicating, which ends up making it a very social experience. This social aspect is, in my opinion, the only reason this game has the level of replayablity that it does.

I have met just about every one of my friends that I regularly talk to on this game. I don’t think there is a game better for that sort of thing. The unfortunate downside to this being such a social game is that it naturally relies on the community to make it a fun experience. You will meet some of the funniest and chill players in this game, and then the lobby will eventually die and the next one you hop into will feature players pulled up from the deepest circle of hell.

My advice is to find those players who you enjoy playing with, and cling onto them for dear life. Too many games with the wrong players will leave you unhappy and drained extremely quickly.

The playerbase is rather small, at least as far as the regulars go. This is a good thing and a bad thing in my opinion. Its small size and variation in experience level and playstyle causes the game to be very cliquey and fosters a community that often feels like high school all over again.

As far as the gameplay goes, it can be surprisingly entertaining. There are so many hilarious moments that happen just about every time I play to this very day, and that says a lot as I have a ridiculous amount of time played. The pace of the game can vary quite a bit. Sometimes your whole lobby will be doing absolutely nothing and other times you have 2-3 people who run off together immediately and try to finish the objectives as fast as possible. Both of these extremes can negatively impact the game in their own ways. If the players do nothing then you sit there for 30 minutes just to die to the blizzard at the end, and if you speedrun the objectives then you don’t let the game progress in a way that will allow for those unique and funny plays that make it worth playing.

There is also a very small skill gap in this game, and instead there is more of a ‘knowledge gap’ that separates the community based on ability. Also, unfortunately, the pvp aspect of the game is much more effective to rely on than deception. Experienced players realize this and are able to get themselves out of situations that they realistically shouldn’t be able to get out of. I believe these things are some of the key reasons that new players don’t come back to the game; and it all comes down to them not feeling like they have a meaningful impact on the result of the game. I honestly can’t blame them for that. I do think this can only be fixed by the community members though, as I don’t see anything the developers could really change with the game that will stop experienced players from ‘abusing’ players who are new to the game.

Overall, I really love this game and I have spent an ungodly amount of time on it for a reason. I think there are a lot of changes that would benefit the game a lot, but in the end the only way to balance a game like this while also keeping everyone happy, is to give us many more custom game settings. Also these settings need to work consistently, as I have seen a ridiculous amount of bugs in custom games, and it is already hard enough to normalize them. Everyone has a different view of what an ideal game is and I feel like changing up the normal mode game mechanics will cause more issues than it will solve, unless there are custom settings implemented that enable players to play with the older settings.

TL;DR very interesting and fun game where you will meet the best and worst people the world has to offer.",Recommended,27,13

i enjoyed this game when i first started running around and trying to figure out what to do, then the toxic community ruined it for me

i tried joining matches 3 times and kept asking people if they could help me cause im new and confused, they continued to ignore me and talk to each other throughout both the 1st matches i tried, then the 3rd match it was the same and they ignored me for most of the game til a group of them got mad that i didnt know how to do anything even tho i was asking since the start and nobody was helping me then when i repeated that im new and need help figuring out what to do, they all started chopping me up w their axes and saying rude things on their mics like ""f*** this kid""

i will never redownload or suggest this game to friends if the players are so bored that they have to bully each other to feel entertained

I have 100+ hours and I don't recommend this game. First of all, the player base is almost non existent.

Although it's a game of deception, there are salty players who will report you just because you manipulated them during the game. You will get reported for nothing by them and their friends and there won't be any action taken for the false reporters. If you don't want to deal with reporting every single game for trolls, griefers, shriekers and leavers; you should be recording every single game just to prove your point.

If it's Blackout, people will convert their friends and their friends won't even fight to ""survive"". Even during the normal mode, people will mostly prioritize what their friends say and act solely on what they said.

Was I banned because of the false reporting? No. But I'm sick and tired of dealing with kids who can't understand that this is a game, and this is a game of DECEPTION. To sum up, if the player base was good this would have been one of the most fun games to play, sadly it's not.",Not Recommended,34,0

Most of these negative reviews don't know what the F they're talking about

These are people who come in the game, mess around for 2-3 hours, mess up and fail, and leave a negative rating on a really good game that has a unique concept that you won't find anywhere else

Project Winter is INSANELY fun and thrilling

You're constantly on your toes, wondering who killed X, and if Y is ACTUALLY helping you, or just buying your trust, so he can brutally cut you open when you're weakened

I was skeptical about this game before i bought it. It looks repetitive, right?

Project Winter is a team survival game where all players are thrown into extreme elemental conditions and so the team must activate a distress signal and wait to be rescued. However, this isn't your only challenge as someone from your team is a traitor whose goal is to prevent you from escaping.

You can create improvised tools, weapons, first-aid kits, items for repairs, and much more so long as you have the necessary resources. Your goal is to work as a team to succeed, figure out who the traitors are (who are randomly selected), get food for sustenance, and materials for crafting or repairing. You will be able to purchase cosmetic items for your player (yes, there are loot boxes) after completing optional special tasks that you can choose at the beginning of the mission as well as for useful actions during gameplay.

Playing as a traitor, you must prevent the survivors from escaping by all available means whilst not allowing yourself to be discovered. How will you do this? Your goal is to shift the blame of your misdeeds to others, sabotage repaired stations, and even kill other players, without being seen of course.

As for the core online component, you should always be able find a suitable lobby to join or simply create your own, but the reporting system works quite poorly and is in need of some serious improvement. Some survivors can be very toxic and complain about you simply because you have the role of a traitor (it happens often) even though that's a core element to the gameplay, which is a huge minus, and get you kicked/banned. Sore losers can fundamentally ruin your experience. The developers need to remedy this. The crafting system is also pretty weak. Want to make an axe? You need stone and wood. Want to make an electrical circuit? You will also need stone and wood. ... What???

Despite the negatives, Project Winter causes both positive and negative emotions. I like working together cooperatively, and not all aspects of the game became immediately clear mind you, but it all depends on each player and their contributions to the end goal. It's fairly easy to recommend, but just be aware of its shortcomings going into it.",Recommended,34,0

After watching groups of streamers play this game I finally got it on sale for myself and a few friends. I was super excited to play, but it wasn't really what I expected. Unless you have eight friends to learn/play with I wouldn't recommend. Learning with people who already know how to play the game is near-impossible, extremely time-consuming, and not very fun at the end of the day. I'll be the first to admit I'm not very good at the game, but there's no system for new players to get better.

A LOT more tricky than Among Us. I'd say 'Among Us' is basically 'Project Winter for dummies'. Not that that's a bad thing.

So my first game (after finishing the tutorial) involves me running around like a headless chicken. Not knowing wtf to do, because you have to FIND the objectives without a gigantic indicator in a pretty large map. (unlike among us)

The Reality:
->MASSIVE<- learning curve. Only 1 map and it's in front of the cabin. You're supposed to look at it. Memorize where you're going and trek there. Very survivalist. But might deter a lot of people.

Characters walk slowly and run after a few seconds, it felt like i needed to press the keys harder. Something to consider if you have Carpal Tunnel (which i do).

'Among Us' has everybody running around doing busywork to fill a win gauge. Project Winter you actually have ROLES. From Hunter to Scientist. everybody has something to do. This makes it quite exciting.

Hunger and Freezing Gauge makes it so you have to routinely resupply at the cabin. The game's focus is mainly survivalist as opposed to ""whodunnit"". Which is good. The thing about 'Among Us' is: If you constantly play as a crewmate, the game gets boring VERY quickly. But in this game, you could focus on supplying food for everyone.....and poisoning it.

The Experience:
After fixing the first repair site we set out looking for the communications tower when suddenly everything goes white and i'm in an area i don't recognize. The panic sets in, then the hunger. I start frantically wandering.

I manage to find a walkie talkie! i shout into it, but only silence answers me. I guess i was the only one who found a walkie-talkie. After wandering around some more; by gods divine grace, i manage to find sustenance. Now all i need is warmth.

I BARELY manage to make it back to the cabin. Allow myself to bathe in the warmth of the fire. From what i remember, The map in front of the cabin marks the objective as being to the south. I prepare myself some berries for the long trek ahead. Exit the cabin determined to help my compatriots! ....and am immediately headshotted.

Game Over. Turns out i was the last survivor. It wasn't silence that answered the walkie talkie, but Lady Death. They speak the same language.",Recommended,17 people found this review helpful 2,3

I've done a lot of thinking over the past few weeks about this game, and my refusal to boot it up again. My disgust for a giant game breaking issue that has been unresolved up until this point is the final nail in the coffin. This is my first ever game review, and this issue that I will describe below has given me the drive to actually write one of these up. After discussing this in length with multiple discord servers of seasoned veterans in this game, I am trying to do the right thing for the general community and warning them about an issue that destroys the integrity and any sort of level playing field this game is currently capable of offering. I am here to warn others and steer them away from looking to buy this game until it has been fixed.

With over 300 hours logged in PW, I've seen a lot of different strategies, had countless fun games, and a lot of good memories. Honestly, there's a lot of awful ones too. Simply put, this is a combat simulator stapled on top of a social deduction game. I'm not the biggest fan of some of the combat mechanics such as crossbows seeming to have very poor ballistic programming compared to the guns, but I'll get to the point.

There is a VERY NOTICEABLE difference in movement speed between controller players and keyboard and mouse players. It is such a substantial difference that it makes this game unplayable. It seems as if in the process of programming controls for controller players, they are capable of moving in more than just the cardinal directions. As pathing and terrain highs/lows have a big impact on the speed of your character, the difference in mechanical hardware that a player chooses to use will end up with large differences in the speed of two characters. A player on keyboard and mouse will be limited to navigating with cardinal directions, which will be slowing the character down as they cross over different terrain. A controller player is capable of consistently moving in directions not available to a keyboard player, cutting down precious distance between the two in relatively short amounts of time. Testing this difference seemed to result in a controller player moving about 4x the speed of a keyboard player. I've seen an empty handed keyboard player get chased down by a weapon wielding controller player and STILL manage to run faster than the keyboard player. And believe me, these players have hundreds and hundreds of hours logged into the game. This is not a matter of player vs. player skill.

I'm not sure what else to say regarding this game besides this: the mechanics are fundamentally broken. It will lead to serious frustration when playing against certain people. It will lead to unfair situations that are beyond a player's skill. This game feels more and more like it has devolved into a subpar combat simulator and less and less like a social deduction game with heavier combat elements. There's no point in playing a game where social deduction can be tossed out the window in favor of running someone down and burying them in the snow with no chance of them escaping. Devs: fix this. It's unacceptable. Buyer beware, this is probably not the social deduction game for you.",Not Recommended,137,20

Snippet:

The game is A LOT OF FUN. I mean, the excitement of a survival game, the thrill of social deduction, the soothing graphics and atmosphere ... just go for it !

The ins and outs:

You and 7 other players are stuck in the middle of nowhere with just a cabin and a fireplace to get warm. Use your fists and brain to gather wood and craft tools, explore the land to find fuel, parts, guns ... fight off the bears and wolves, set traps, and almost as importantly, take care of your mates.
A quater of your squad (a squad of 5 people, up to 8) is actually only interested in sabotage, treason, and murder. While you'll try to reconnect the beacon and call for excraction they'll do anything they can to stop you; or maybe vice versa.

Gameplay:

The game has an ingame voice chat. Use it to talk with the people around you. Craft or find talkies to discuss with a friend from across the map and secretly elaborate plans... Or go oldschool with the proximity text chat, or written messages to your talkie friend.
Use weapons and tools to fend off animals, gather ressources or food, use traps to kill bears... or just use everything to kill your mates; the ones you suspect.... or just sabotage the mission in a bloodbath. If you are more of a subtle player: sabotage doors, steal ressources to slow down the escape process, or just take the helicopter before they do.

This game is currently in the Humble Choice for January 2021. If you are interested in the game and it's before February 1st, 2022, consider picking up the game as part of the current monthly bundle.

A survival game, no wait, social deduction, no it's a cluster!@#$… wait, it’s all of these things.

Project Winter is an interesting game, there are 8 players and each player is either a survivor or a traitor. The survivors try to get rescued, the traitors don’t want to be rescued, and there are a couple of objectives to complete. In the two games I played, the survivors tried to restore power then they had to find and fix up a helipad. It’s a good concept.

The problem is this is also a dense game where the tutorial doesn’t give you a ton of information and I think because a lot of people are new to the game from Humble that they’re not playing it right. Communication is a bit light, there’s no social deduction, and on both games, the mega blizzard killed the group which apparently is an artificial time limit. At least I’m pretty sure it is.

This is a game where you’re going to have to learn the game, and probably one you should play with an established group as the influx of new players and the fact so few things are well explained is a barrier to entry.

Pick this up if you want a more active Among Us, it’s far more complicated than that and players have to work together rather than doing their tasks, but this feels like it could be a really good game, though it’s one that players will have to put in the time and effort to understand.

Project Winter is an absolute blast of a game that seamlessly combines elements of survival gameplay with the traitor concept similar to the cardgame Werewolves of Millers Hollow. This game truly sets a higher standard for party games.

What really sets Project Winter apart from other party games is its perfect balance of survival, teamwork and betrayal. The survival aspect of the game keeps you on your toes as you scavenge for resources, explore ruins and battle against the harsh wilderness, while the social deduction aspect keeps you constantly guessing as to who among your friends is eventually and inevitably going to stab you in the back.

But what really makes Project Winter stand out from other games in this genre is its incredible replayability. With a variety of different roles to play and multiple different maps to explore, you'll never run out of new experiences to enjoy with your friends. Each game is a unique and exciting adventure that will keep you coming back for more. This makes Project Winter way more fun than Among Us. The game is much more dynamic and engaging, and the gameplay is much more suspenseful and rewarding. With its excellent combination of survival and social deduction elements, Project Winter truly raises the bar for what a party game can be.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend Project Winter highly enough. If you're looking for a fun, engaging, and challenging party game that will keep you and your friends entertained for hours on end, then look no further.",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 2,0

Gdybym miał porównać tą grę, to najbardziej podobna jaką znam jest Deceit: jest grupa śmiałków która próbuje uciec z miejsca, w którym się znajdują, aby się ratować, a zdrajcy muszą im przeszkodzić. Nikt prócz zdrajców nie wie, kto jest zdrajcą nawet przy zabijaniu, więc lepiej skupić się na ucieczce, obserwując innych graczy, bo zdrajca staje się silniejszy gdy go nie widać. Zdrajca może grać pasywnie bez zdradzieckich sztuczek trzymając się grupy, stając się niewykrywalny, ale to nie warto na dłuższą metę, gdyż ktoś musi przeszkodzić w ucieczce (cóż, chyba że gracze się zabijają między sobą).

Co więcej ma w sobie Project Winter? Przede wszystkim kluczowa jest współpraca. Samemu gracz nie może dostać się do bunkrów w którym magazynowane są materiały niezbędne do osiągnięcia głównego celu. Samemu nie da się nawet przeżyć przy pierwszym kontakcie z wilkami. Mając zaufanego towarzysza możesz osiągnąć wiele, o ile ten towarzysz nie jest zdrajcą, no cóż...

Wcielając się w zdrajcę, ma się wiele możliwości na uśmiercenie reszty, i nie tylko uśmiercenie, a przynajmniej uniemożliwienie ucieczki. Jest wiele sposobów, ale żaden nie jest skuteczny na wszystkie sytuacje. Coś co się wydaje skuteczne raz, następnym razem może nie mieć aż tak owocnego efektu. Zdrajca musi dostosować swoją strategię do strategii grupy, zauważyć i wykorzystać ich słaby punkt.

TLDR - Buy this game (with the DLC) for $6 during a Steam sale if you are an adult cis white male or have a degradation kink. Otherwise, reconsider for the time being.

When I first downloaded this game, I absolutely loved it.

The community had some toxic people here and there, but overall it was friendly and welcoming and I made a lot of wonderful friends from the lobby. I loved the mechanics of the game, and it quickly became my go-to game. I was playing it most nights after work for several hours and became fairly well known in the community. The DLC was my favorite and what I played regularly (and how I would recommend that anyone play the game). When I heard the Xbox update was happening, I was excited because that meant that there would be more players to play with since the community was pretty small.

And then the Xbox update happened, and I immediately felt regret for ever being excited.

The TLDR for this next section is basically this - the reporting system for Project Winter is extremely broken and is going to bring you a lot of frustration if you end up in a bad lobby (which happens fairly often thanks to the fact that this game is included with gamepass. Trolls don't lose anything if they are banned from a game that they didn't pay for, so they will play until they get banned, wait the 24 hours - 2 weeks, and go at it again.)

After the cross-play update, the number of sexist and abusive comments that I received in games skyrocketed. I faced multiple lobbies where I was griefed and killed almost immediately because I was a female. Now, I know that toxicity unfortunately comes with certain games and certain communities, so it didn't bother me, but I became concerned at the amount of other female players I knew that were giving up the game because of the amount of abuse they were receiving. And the abuse wasn't being targeted at only women, but all minority groups. I play almost exclusively in the DLC lobbies, so I knew I wasn't even getting the full force of the abuse that was in the regular lobbies. So, I began recording all of my games and reporting the toxic players both in game and in the Project Winter Discord with video proof. The devs had said in the Discord that they were doing the best they could to weed out all of the ""toxic"" players in the Xbox community like they had done for the PC community in the past, so my hopes were that by reporting with undeniable proof how abusive some of these players were being, something would be done and the community I had grown to love would come back, right?

Wrong.

The only terms for a permaban in Project Winter is if you cheat. I believe they are *just* now increasing that scope after a lot of pushback from the community to include if you use the ""most well known offensive slur,"" but from what I can gather, in most instances a toxic player (with video proof) will only be banned anywhere from 24 hours to two weeks (although I think it is usually on the shorter side). The devs/community mods often point out that they play games with the community all the time and it always goes well for them so the community ""really can't be that toxic"", but I don't think they understand that any ""trolls"" are on their best behavior if they are in a lobby with them because they know they will get banned. Combine a free game with short ban times and, well, you get the picture.

The second issue with this is the in-game mechanic that involves swapping skins with a dead player. While this can really help with deception in the game, it is a nightmare for toxic players. Switch skins with someone that you killed out, hide the body, and you are free to go on a toxic rampage under someone else's tag and get them reported! There have been actual instances of legitimate players getting permabanned because a cheater stole their skin after they killed them, axed the whole lobby, and got reported for something they didn't do. Luckily on the main instance I saw of this, several members had video proof that the legit player was not the one actually hacking and it was another player that stole their skin, but I wonder if the player hadn't had other players to back them up with video proof if they would have been allowed back in their game on the ban appeal, which leads me to my last point.

Because Steam freely allows you to change your name, it is really easy to troll lobbies this way. Someone can change their Steam name to yours and if they have the same ranking as you, easily impersonate you in a lobby if you are a regular. Now, while I don't think this would impact in-game reports for toxicity, it does make me worried for Discord reports because all they require is a name and a reason why you want to report them. Video proof helps solidify your claim and makes it more likely something will be done (that something likely being a 24 hour ban, but that's not the point), but with most reports users aren't required to submit their Steam account or anything of the nature to be able to track what accounts the player played with. So, what does that mean if someone changes their username to the same as mine, is super toxic in several lobbies, and then changes their name back? The mods claim that they check those things and that someone can't hide from a ban by changing their name, however considering that they permabanned someone for cheating that DC'ed when loading into the lobby and had their skin taken by a hacker, I don't really believe that they are actively looking into those claims. I think they are taking it at face value and if username X is reported (and they do decide to take action), they will take action against username X instead of seeing if username Y had anything to do with it.

Lastly, the game is really overpriced for what it offers and what the community has become. I bought it on sale with the DLC for around $6, and I would only recommend buying it if it is on sale for that price and you have the patience to deal with toxic people. The community has gotten slightly better as time has gone on, but I don't use my mic when I play anymore (which is rarely) so that could also be why I am facing less problems.

I really loved this game, and I am so disappointed at what it has turned into. Maybe six months from now I will be able to come back and enjoy a game with friends but for now, any time I load into it I leave because any open lobbies have players that I have had issues with in the past, or I end up being targeted because I am not using my mic (which is a whole rant for another day). I hope things change for the sake of the wonderful players that I have met that made the game fun for me in the past. For now, I will play First Class Trouble instead.",Not Recommended,119,11

Project Winter is a blast to play. Played about 5 matches so far and it's fun trying to figure out who the traitors are. When you die you become a ghost and you can either try and help, or slow down the remaining survivors or traitors. It's all up to you. There are also animals you can kill or be killed by. You collect material and craft different items to help with survival.

I highly recommend checking it out this weekend since it is free to play for the weekend. I already decided to purchase the game after the matches I played. When you play make sure you play the tutorial so you can understand the concepts of being a survivor and a traitor. Then jump in and make new friends and enemies.",Recommended,22,1

Game is great. Most of the negative reviews revolve around people griefing, but it's really not as bad as people claim it to be. In fact, most people who are regulars playing PW are really chill and the amount of deception that goes on with seasoned players is what really makes this game so much fun.

Lobby's can feel empty, but I've never had a problem jumping in with randoms and picking up a game. Usually takes at most MAYBE 5 minutes but it's really not that bad.

The only thing I don't enjoy about the game is the ranged combat system. Guns and crossbows are pretty annoying to fight with when there's elevated terrain.",Recommended,20,0

Can´t recommend it right now, even the concept is actually good (got that salem town vibe).

The experience for new players is just ridiculous bad.

1. The playerbase is so low, you will sit in lobbies most of the time if you don´t have 7 friends who play this game everytime you play it.

2. Highlevel players who got bored because they unlocked most things will just randomly grief everyone, even they aren´t the traitor, since they don´t care about max possible points (let as many survive as possible) but simply care about a solo win.

This game is a unique blend of item-based Survival and Deception.
Roles are set in a similar fashion to Among Us, where as 2 player's are Traitors while 6 others are Survivors.
The Snow is thick and Cold, venture out long enough and you'll be sure to freeze to death.... But do not Fear!
Nature always has your back, the lands are full of resources to Plunder for your Survival.

I am personally an Among Us fan and this game just evolves that formula so much, in its own Fresh and Unique way. It is an extremely fun game i highly recommend.
Friends are a great addition though not entirely needed, the times playing by myself i have noticed most lobbies are vocal and you tend to meet new people as you play.

Even more reason to consider joining the Fun is that the game is soon to hit Xbox Gamepass (As of writing), which means a growing Playerbase as Project Winter supports Crossplay.

Step 1: Gain trust, inject survivor and have him accused and killed.

The location-based chat feature is my favorite element of this hidden traitor game. It makes for spectacular possibilities with traitors able to run off and kill survivors without other people able to hear them scream. The game is excellently balanced in Normal mode (too easy for survivors in Basic and Blackout). Unlike many other games in this genre (Depth, Dead by Daylight, Among Us), the game is not ruined by having new players play with experienced players. The game encourages survivors to work together but doesn't require it. There are enough different objective types that each subsequent play won't feel identical. Roles are randomly assigned and not present in every game, so you never know what surprise abilities another player may have. This is a aesthetically beautiful masterpiece of social deception, teamwork, and survival craft.

Project Winter Review
Project Winter follows the veins of deceptive social games like Town of Salem and expands on the same idea tremendously, offering up a well of content and depth that encourages extremely creative play. It's such a shame, however, that an ocean as deep as Project Winter is only inhabited by the population of your average household fish tank.

A: Simple, because the game is unplayable for me. For almost two hours I sat as a helpless fly on the wall because the game repeatedly failed to detect my microphone, even after trying recommended fixes on their discord. I eventually resorted to becoming a mute student while friendlier members of the community taught me how the game worked. Moreover, the player population is so low that it took ages for me just to find a suitable open lobby in my region. I'd gladly sink far more hours into this game if I could.

Let's continue...

Everyone gathers basic resources such as wood and stone for warmth and tools at the beginning of the game, but it doesn't take long for the group to separate, spreading out in the woods. This is where the game truly shines. Project Winter's chat is proximity-based, both text and VOIP. This leads to certain moments where you may overhear traitors plotting with each other behind a treeline, or maybe even witness a murder of a fellow survivor. Much like other deception games; paranoia and suspicion play a crucial role in Project Winter. You'd probably find yourself in hot water if the group notices the partner you set out into the woods with has failed to return to camp with you.

Project Winter boasts a steep learning curve as it features and intricate crafting and item combination system. For example, players may find or build walkie-talkies, which allow them to directly contact other players who possess walkie-talkies of the same colour. With the only other option of communication being through proximity voice chat. There are even crates littered across the map that will only unlock for traitors, but will sound a quite audible alarm once opened. In my experience, traitors have often opened these crates for items such as poison or weapons. Knowing a shot ringing out from behind the treeline would raise suspicion, traitors would often dispose of any evidence and flee the scene, rousing even more paranoia within the group.

Sometimes, even if you do end up in a lobby which starts, the game dissolves into madness and confusion. I've joined groups filled with new players twice and both times, nobody knew what to do or say when someone got killed. We ended up with no escape plan, made no progress towards identifying the traitors, and no coordination. Luckily, my earlier experiences were far more pleasant, preventing these incidents from souring my overall perception of what this game is really like.

Project Winter's item combination system adds a wealth of depth to the art of deception. Traitors have the ability to poison food items to assassinate stray survivors. Your trusted buddy that had just handed you a walkie-talkie or valuable supplies may in fact be planning to betray you by separating you from the group, then plant evidence on your body with the intention of framing you as a traitor, gaining the misguided trust of the other survivors. Every game has the potential to unfold in an entirely different way, which sets it apart from its peers, which favour far more simplified mechanics. Project Winter is therefore a welcome addition to its genre.

At this point, you're probably wondering why I barely have any play time down despite the praise that I have for the game. So let's be realistic and talk for a second here.

I have no doubt that Project Winter is a great game with a decent amount of replayability. Its mechanics are intuitive and innovative. I truly have no complaints over the game's content in terms of quality delivered. The issues that mar my interest are technical and social in nature.

As mentioned earlier, my microphone simply failed to work with this game. I understand that the game is early access, and it may have been my fault for not applying the fix correctly, but a bug is a bug nonetheless. Moreover, it seems that this microphone issue isn't common. Most if not all the people I've met playing this game have had no issues whatsoever, but that's why you have the ability to refund games on Steam, so I wouldn't let that stop you from trying out this game.

The social aspect is Project Winter's main problem, and may even be its downfall. There is a massive division between players. I've met a small handful of high-level people who I assume are this game's loyal fans, but most of the others I've met have been low level players. Rarely do I ever see someone join the lobby with a rank that fills this gap between levels. From my standpoint, I believe that though there is an active and loyal fanbase behind this wonderful game, its newer players aren't being engaged enough to continue playing. This game is most active in the US region, which usually has at least one or two games running when I check on it. The bottom line is that Project Winter, for the social deception game that it is, simply lacks the playerbase and popularity to provide a consistent experience. I simply don't have the patience or time to attentively sit in the lobby browser waiting for a joinable game to appear.

Do not let technical difficulties scare you. You can always refund games, remember that.

Project Winter delivers everything it advertises without a doubt. I'd recommend it to anyone with friends who already own the game, or anyone who intends to purchase the game along with at least 6 other friends. Otherwise, the player population is simply too low for games to be found on a regular basis. I truly wish this weren't the case.",Recommended,22 people found this review helpful 0,5

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have just been playing the game for about 12 ""hours"" (Not all of which is play time by the way, added in just now to clarify, as most of it is sitting in empty lobbies) in total and there is a serious troll issue with this community. The majority seem fine but the aggressive few truly spoil it and will keep this player base low if it's allowed to continue and some notice isn't put up that people should yes, lie, confuse, create chaos, kill ect but not troll.

------POST EDIT NOTE
actually dead game 
A Screenshot of Project Winter
By: Brechnor

(how can I possibly have 20 hours played when these lobbies are empty most of the time)
-----END POST EDIT NOTE

In one game recently a couple of hours ago I was planting mines at the repaired stations to protect them. one guy (who turned out to be the traitor, no surprise) was harassing me over it accross the game after that, mad that I was right about him. I did not sadly know about the reporting system. (well I still can't find one in game)

In the game after that happened I said ""are you the traitor again lol"" and he suddenly turned salty and mad, got every one to exile me, started throwing abuse like ""no mic shouldn't be playing"" ""don't play with me again"" ""stop following me"" ""you are no good"" ""useless player"" *paraphrasing* etc (dare I say the whole point of the game is to work ""together"", no? so far all the other games I had people with mics were more than happy that mine isn't currently working and had no issue communicating requests for help)... In isolation that wouldn't matter but it was sustained in that subsequent game which in my opinion, shouldn't be accepted and each game should be taken as fresh with no bearing on the last.

The irony is in the game before the one that he was a traitor, he was fine, told people to join him and ally with him etc but suddenly turned angry because I was right about him in that game when he was, which as far as i'm concerned was completely uneccessary.

If i knew about the report feature I would have definitely filled one in, I will investiate where it is now. Sadly it's too late to report that game unless you can go through my previous games and try to find it then listen to the voice logs.

EDIT: There is no clear report feature in game. All I can find is ""go to discord"". Some things need to have immediate report methods within a game or it's just too late, which just looking at any past game with chat options will tell you.

Can you please make the report function a little more obvious and perhaps place a very clear moderation warning on the introduction (splash) screen of the game that verbal or text based harassement based on previous games won't be accepted, state that logs are recorded (or not) and that new players are not ""useless"" because every one has to learn at the start when they are new. (in fact I would argue that calling out the traitor correctly is more clever than useless)

I can't recommend the game to my steam friends in its current moderated state. If it wasn't for the lack of clear rules that seem to make these people become unhinged then this would seriously be one of my top most played games on steam. EDIT: Not any more, sorry.

The few like this can truly spoil the atmosphere of the game, and do some serious long term reputation damage to it if moderated action or accepted behaviour isn't made more obvious to them.

EDIT at 19/20 ""hours played"" (false time report, actual played time is MUCH much lower)

1: Lobbies are empty 90% of the time, the game only came out a few days ago and i've had it for a couple of days, it's basically dead even though I don't like using that term, it does apply here. my actual game time is only a few hours and not the 19 that steam is reporting.

2: The game disconnects you and doesn't let you back in, even if you are still on the internet.


3: The games that do work are spoilt by trols, who also mess around in lobbies, unticking ready and just voice chat.

When there are lobbies it's cool to cancel the ready status, apparently



apparently they do however get banned eventually;


Yett there is no in game button to do that while a game is in progress.

3.1 Games have no admins, there is no one to look at live abuse or harassement or to put server warnings in chat.


They say you can report via discord but by then it's already too late to not sour the experience.

3.2 I still could not find the in game reporting system, if there is one.

4: The chances of actually completing a game with other people are slim. I spent 10 mins on my own after saving 2
survivors who just decided to leave/use escape pod and not returning help in kind.


4.1: You can finish on your own but have no choice but to start with a minimum of 5 people, preferably 8.
Do you want to play with a friend and learn to survive? Nope, you can't do that.


5: Empty game selling cosmetics for real world money.



(why is this a problem? because cosmetics are shown in game and if you can't start a game with minimum players, you are wasting your money on literally nothing)

6: issues with european server communication.


7: Disconnects at the start of games


8. It's easy to work out who is a traitor

This is currently the most fleshed out and enjoyable social deduction game, in my opinion. Aside from just social manipulation, there are a ton of different ways for traitors to sabotage the objectives or slow down and prevent survivors from escaping. Anywhere from siphoning parts out of the objective, planting mines, bear traps, poisoning food, jamming radios and leading people into the wilderness to kill them where no one can hear them, to simply running around the map and opening traitor crates to get buff and fight the survivors head on. Completing the objectives as a survivor isn't particularly easy either and takes a good bit of communication and teamwork. The game offers additional incentive to complete the match and objectives by giving points that can be spent to open crates or purchase cosmetics.

My only complaints are: 1. The lack of a decent tutorial. It took me hours to get any sort of grasp on the game mechanics and even now 30 something hours in there are some things I may not completely understand. I've hardly touched the DLC for this reason. And 2. Dead players being able to essentially reveal Traitors by debuffing them in front of survivors. It doesn't happen often, but when it does it can feel pretty cheap.

Overall though, I highly recommend. The game can often be a ton of fun and is a great tool to improve social skills.",Recommended,24,1

10/10 game.

Best with friends.

This is my favourite game right now easily. Honestly it's not even close... I think I'm actually addicted... You can play with the same group of friends and each game is still fresh. DEVS KEEP UPDATING PLEASE! I love this game and love all the content! Keep it coming!! I will buy any DLC that is released. So cash in on that Devs! More cosmetic items and objectives would be cool too.

One area of criticism... I think the Survivors should be able to call for rescue still after the mega blizzard starts (timer running out). It's pointless to run around just to die. If you can work on the objective during the mega blizzard then you should be able to call for help if you achieve all the objectives even if the mega blizzard has begun. Again a small criticism but I think it should be addressed.

One complaint aside... still a masterpiece of a game that I plan on sinking a ton more hours into.

Do yourself a favour and buy the game.

Game was fun until the Xbox/Crossplay update. They opened the game up to a wider audience; great, right? Nope.

I've heard the n-word more in one day of playing this game after the Xbox/Crossplay update, than I've ever heard previously in it. Actually, I think I never heard it when it was only PC players. Pub games, which were the typical hit-or-miss that you'd expect from multiplayer games, have fallen into miss-or-miss-or-miss-or-hit. A lot of third party communication going on, e.g. one survivor dying and then multiple people no where near, with no radios, know who the traitor is; a lot of very horrible people getting on and using multiple slurs. It's a multiplayer game, so your mileage may vary, but from my experiences, it's pretty bad.

I don't say any of this out of the assumption that I'm the best player or even a good player. I play the game, try to have fun, that's it.

It's not a bad game, it's pretty fun when the stars align, but that's few and far between. The games can be decently long and drawn out depending on how the traitors and survivors play, how much they know, etc. It can make the game a lot more grindy and boring at its worst.

They also recently updated the roles, which I'm not a giant fan of. I get what they were going for, but I personally don't like it.

Thanks to this game, I was able to acquire a significant portion of my library when the market was completely unhinged. I would do anything to see this game brought back to life. It’s so much fun, and its complexity makes it rare to find two matches that are alike. I understand why some people don’t want to invest more time in it, but it’s a real shame to see it in its current state. The potential is there, but it’s been completely squandered by both the developers and the community. If you ever get the chance to snag it on sale, don’t hesitate.",Recommended,12,5

People will say this game has a toxic community, others will say that it's not balanced or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that. I'm here to tell you that in the 42 hours I played right now, I only encountered 2 toxic players that were exiled and killed and reported and probably banned fairly quickly. You can't avoid toxic players when playing with other people.

Let's talk about the reporting system. The reporting system is slightly flawed, yes, but there is a thumbs up system to make up for it, so if you get a lot of thumbs up, a report won't really hurt you because you got good ""reviews"" of other players. And if a player abuses the report system, they will get banned 100%.

This game is worth the amount of money it asks for, and if you want to play private games only with friends, this game is for you! Perfect for private games, great for public games! Everybody can have fun with this game.",Recommended,15,1

If you can name a social deduction game, I've played it. My favourite games of all time were social deduction games. With that, I can confidently say that THIS IS NOT a social deduction game. If you're playing this game for the social deduction aspects, you've picked the wrong game. This game's PVP system vastly overpowers any advantage from social deduction. The only time that this game plays out as a social deduction game is if you get a group of like-minded players who want to play for the social deduction aspects of this game, and create a private match. Otherwise, it will not play out like one.

In normal mode:
In lobbies with bronze thumb players (basically new players), the majority of them do not, and have not played social deduction games before, and there will likely be a few trolls or metagaming friends. It does not play out like a social deduction game. You will likely make it to the end as a survivor with a few minutes left, and then the traitors will attempt a last-ditch effort to win through PVP.
In lobbies with bad silver/gold thumb players (basically experienced players), the same is probably true with their experience in social deduction games. However, they are all a little bit more experienced, and as such, know that the game's PVP mechanics far overpower any social deception/deduction that someone might attempt, and as such, don't even try for it. The traitors go off into the wild and buff up with energy drinks, and slowly pick off survivors, because the survivors are barely coordinated here.
In lobbies with good players, the survivors all rush objectives, while the traitors buff up, preparing for fights. There is only PVP here. If you try sussing someone who is in the group, they will leave them alive, because one weak traitor is not very impactful if everyone just goes in a group.

The only alternative is Blackout mode, where I have sunk the majority of my hours. In this mode, there is only one traitor, who can convert the survivors. Due to the fact that the evil faction will inevitably grow larger, soon beyond the point where you can stop it, the survivors must attempt to employ social deduction. However, they do not, and as such, this gamemode has a 90% traitor winrate from what I've seen, the only survivor wins coming from experienced lobbies where the survivors mindlessly rush the objectives and win within eight minutes, or the traitor is new to the game, and doesn't understand how to play.

Needless to say, the only time where social deduction is required is if you want to actually have fun, which does not happen unless you play with friends.




Otherwise, this game is great for interacting with people, and finding new friends!",Not Recommended,10 people found this review helpful 5,1

At a research station in a frozen tundra, where the weather has turned for the worse with massive storms becoming more frequent & extreme, eight survivors are trapped. Not everyone is who they pretend to be. Two traitors have infiltrated the ranks and disrupted communications, and other key equipment will need to be repaired in order to call for a rescue. In order to survive, you will need to work with the other survivors to loot buildings, gather needed resources such as craft food, tools & weapons, and repair broken machinery. Good communication & teamwork is vital; venture off on your own and you make yourself a target, all while trying to avoid and identify those who wish to see you fail. The traitors are outnumbered but will gain strength as the game progresses, with their own set of perks & abilities that the rest of the team does not have. They will also gain additional advantages for making you fail in your missions. Finding out who they are is not easy; vigilance is needed in your observations of everything that happens around you. The traitors are not your only threat; wild animals are roaming about – they can be eaten, or if you're not careful, they may eat you. Periodically a vicious blizzard will roll in; get caught outside for too long and you shall perish. But death is not the end; once your life has ended your ghost will have a few powers to either help the survivors or debuff the traitors. Good luck survivors!

Released on May 23, 2019, by the developer Other Ocean Interactive & Published by Other Ocean Group, this is an action cooperative survival game at heart with a mixture of strategy and RPG elements. It features an outstanding low poly graphics in a bird's eye view. It is accompanied by a delightful soundtrack as well as very well-done sound effects. Its proximity-based voice chat allows for communication with anyone in the vicinity. Alternatively, there are two radio types you can use to speak privately, as long as no one else has one. It has a set of creative mechanics at play that has a medium learning curve, so it may take you a few games to grasp how everything works. With random generation for the game world and multiple escape scenarios, no two games will never be quite the same. Full controller support allows you to play it your way. With character progression that unlocks clothing sets, and rewards that allow you to buy multi-tiered loot crates with the money you earn to customize your character to your heart's desire.

Quite a remarkable survival game with its unique genre blending. Though the traitor mechanic isn't totally original, they managed to use it to their advantage and made something remarkable and essential to the title. I play a lot of games with the mechanic and totally enjoy them, especially with friends. The winter biome is done nicely, and those blizzards are really something else! (I have an infinitive love for titles that feature a good winter scenario.) I admit I am not the greatest at the game yet as I am still learning everything. Playing with pubs is not my favorite thing to do; I prefer playing with friends personally, and I am really looking forward to more of my friends getting the title. Finding games is not all that difficult; often servers will be full though, and finding an open lobby is difficult at times. I found that when there were no open lobbies, you could just open one yourself; it will fill pretty fast, and then you're on your way! With a fair retail price and randomly-generated games, it’s great value with a great amount of replayability.

As there is no single-player gameplay to learn the game, I would have liked to have had a tutorial to introduce the player to the core mechanics. I personally do not like having to jump into a game with seasoned players who take advantage of your lack of knowledge. A basic tutorial giving the player the needed knowledge for basic survival & key mechanics would be quite helpful for new players.

I would absolutely recommend this game to people, especially if you have a small group of friends that you can play with. The games take at the most 30 minutes which is fine, hopefully you can get a group of people moving in the same general direction. I'm one of the people that wants to farm the mats and have the generator up and running in 5 minutes, its not an easy task when you have everyone doing different things. However, some games you get a great group and everyone is on point, and some games it's the polar opposite but that's just how the game goes. To sum up i would give it a 8/10 and look forward to some new content or a new patch soon.

I've played a few games, sprinkled throughout the day. A few in the morning, a couple late at night and also in the afternoon. Overall for a game like this (survival, teamwork and deduction) I had maybe 1 bad game (as my first time as traitor, not sure what was happening) out of the many I played (and by bad I mean people being toxic). I know some people found the community toxic but I found it quite the opposite. I found people were really nice when I asked for help or tried explaining things to me, and in turn when I learned something new I tried to also teach it to players more new than me. Am I good at this game? Not at all but I really have had a blast playing it so far. If you find a good random group to play a few rounds with, it's fun.

This is a game that you can easily screw with your friendships. You can be who you want to be and use different strategies to win. You never know what will happen every game. It’s currently a small community that is easy to get to know. The devs are very responsive and trying to make this game grow and become even better. It’s one of my favorite games of all times. It’s a game that you are the one who makes it fun with what you are willing to do to win. Just remember, someway or another. Everyone is a traitor.

There is a lot of conflict about how this game is dead. It is not dead. The community is thriving and full of good people. It depends on what area you are from but the peak hours is usually 7pm your time. Remeber to come to the discord if you have questions or want to form a group.

A less casual approach in comparison to Among Us, although still accessible. There is a tutorial and roles are explained well. You will need more dexterity and better hand-eye-coordination for Project Winter. The aspects of deception are comparable to Among Us, although Project Winter offers a lot more possibilities, while a lot of the finer psychological aspects remain in one way or another.
For instance, if you know what your friends sound like when they're lying, you can apply your knowledge just as well in this game. Then again, if an alibi doesn't quite add up, you might end up killing one of your loved ones. And just as in real life, killing your friends is always kind of a bummer.
Oh, and you might have chaos ensue when people randomly start hitting or blaming each other. And then, once someone is dead, you can wear their clothes to make yourself look like them, because that helps with the formerly mentioned chaos. So if you're also a good voice actor, this game could become your new favorite.
The community consists of, I would say 68-87% okay people (at least okay to play with, not necessarily to marry) and your occasional griefer/troll. But don't worry, there's also a report function and an indicator for a player's reputation, represented by a thumbs-up-icon with colors ranging from red (nu-uh) to the standard bronze (whatever) to silver (whatever+) to gold (okay). Note that not every okay player has a golden reputation, as reputation resets over time. So sometimes you'll have to play with them first to get to know them better. Yuck, I know.

Why you should or should not play Project Winter

What is Project Winter?

An awesome survival game with the main objective of escaping, you can LITERALLY betray your friends. For those of you who know of among us, might relate it to this game however it is a lot more in depth. Instead of tasks you need to craft weapons, items and cook your own food in order to survive this game... while also being watched by the traitors. There are more ways to die other then just the traitor killing you, you can die from bears, moose, wolves, and even the COLD. There is proximity voice chat which plays a huge roll in the overall game (Like yelling who the traitor is). There is still more too it, but I will let you figure that out for yourself!



-'Oh god whats happening'
-'Did I just die from being eaten by a bear?'
-'I just murdered a snow man'

This game had a roller coaster of emotions, and you can tell that the creators took the time to really make this game work with a variety of hilarious and technical things. At first I really thought ""Among Us knock off"" but then I actually played it and it was so much more intense then that.



I would say the overall playability is pretty simple and straightforward... the do have a tutorial but I did not play it and went straight in. The randoms in my game actually helped and taught me how to play the game... they thought it was hilarious that I didn't play the tutorial and just went straight in confused and afraid.




For keyboard and mouse it is basic controls, WASD for walking and your mouse keys for cutting down trees and such. You can still change your keybinds before, after and during the game.
During the actual game play, it is pretty straightforward, crafting, running, foraging, etc. This game is also both keyboard and controller friendly, I believe they sell it on multiple platforms as well so you will run into a load of different kinds of people.
So far my computer did not lag, and it looks like you can edit the graphics and make it a pretty low running game if needed.
There is also a load of character customization that is included in the main screen, you have a variety of items you can choose from.
There are events that happen during the game which makes it harder to survive or identify the traitor (like snow storms, the traitor teleports you etc)
Considering the amount of different ways you can die because of this game, it can become super complicated when you are being hunted and one of your only safe spots is the cabin itself but you cant stay their forever because you do need to escape the game.
When you die you can choose to spectate and see what is happening and help out by giving people warmth and food or hurt by making people suffer and speed up the decreasing of food and warmth.

There are other game modes, however I only played one of them so I will not be mentioning them in this review.



In my opinion, the graphics in this game are unique and beautiful. There are spots in the game where you can stand and admire the games beauty at a different perspective compared to your eagle eye view. They did an amazing job with snow, snow trails and character design.



AMAZING 10/10 got rick rolled the first game I played with a father son duo.
However, if you do not like playing with children under the age of 14 then maybe do not play this game. The game is a range of ages, and from what I saw there is an equal amount of people under the age of 18 as well as over.



You can play for as long as you want, because this game is more on the competitive side, you can play over and over and over again. The game can take anywhere between 10-30 ish minutes. Then you can choose to stay in that lobby of people or switch lobbys and play with different people.



Honestly, I would recommend this game if you enjoy foraging, crafting, survival and competitive pvp roles. For me, I enjoyed it because everyone made me laugh and made me have a really really good time while playing the game. As for if I would play again, I might, so far though I haven't. Now one more thing is that the game isn't too too active, there could be more players but I understand that is dependent on the person themselves, but that is not going to change my overall opinion of the game itself!

Fun but heavily flawed game. The game is trying to be so much, it has complex objectives, survival mechanics, and two hidden traitors. This complexity will immediately push new players away. Add to this the incredibly long 30 min game times, which is atrocious if you get murdered early or have leavers. It's hard to end the game quickly as a survivor because traitors can win even if they are all dead. Unless you've watched this game for years like I have, the game will feel obtuse and frustrating.

Gets boring really fast. Only fun with nice people, and stops being fun even with them as soon as they get to know you and when you're bluffing. Sadly, quite a few bad, toxic apples.

Traitor gameplay is boring and always the same. They always run the same tactic so it's easy to counter them, because there are no other tactics to utilize.

Survivor gameplay is just doing chores, which is absolutely ♥♥♥♥. Most people you play with don't even understand what they're supposed to do.

Gunplay is absolutely trash.

There is a surprising amount of depth in the raw mechanics of the game:
- Precisely timing a 99% charged swing maximizes DPS / efficiency
- Timing your swings while spinning extends your range
- Moving with nothing in your hand increases your speed
- Aiming to throw extends your vision
- Throwing items at someone slows the target
There's also a lot of strategy you pick up on over dozens of hours:
- Guarding and trapping objectives
- Hiding and destroying resources
- Determining what information is safe to say in proximity chat, over a radio, or globally (e.g. 2nd objective beacon)
- Acquiring info from snow trails / losing pursuers in a chase
- How to position around high ground, north camera, and hiding places in combat
All of the mechanics can be part of the social and deceptive elements. All of the following is important information:
- Who stayed to mine rocks
- How a group reacted upon finding radios
- What items someone leaves in a chest
- Which direction people suggest to travel in
- Who touched which dead bodies
I could write a list of maybe 70 things to keep track of and even then each game brings unique circumstances that challenge these fundamentals. This game has a lot going on.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 1,0

If you started out with Among Us or are familiar with other social deception games, but ever felt like it lacked an element of interactivity or ability to affect the game through teamwork and gameplay, this is a game for you.

Adding in combat (and not a simple one-button kill option) and the need to keep your stats (heat, hunger, and health) in order leads to a much more involved game that makes it replayable over many months, with no two games being exactly the same. You can take things into your own hands at times, but it is often important to rely on teamwork to be successful.

For those new to the game, there is a bit of a learning curve, but relying on the tutorial and easy game modes help to pick up, followed by asking questions of players as you get into regular games. Having a headset makes playing the game much easier. Some might find that learning curve too daunting, but there are many regular players that otherwise didn't really consider themselves ""gamers"" prior to getting the hang of this game.

The reporting system and the discord server help to combat the trolls you might find in any game. Overall, a great game with a good core group in the community that you will get to know well and meet up to play with frequently!",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Basically, it's a 2D battle royale game where you fight 63 other colorful animals to the death with guns and various melee weapons (lollipops, newspaper, fly swatters, pizza cutters, etc.). It's fun, cartoony, silly, and cute, and I love every bit of that. Oh, and this game penalizes death with random, bad animal puns, so prepare to get ""diskoalafied"" a lot.

The gameplay is very fun, and it's great when you get better at it! In fact, there are also a wide variety of weapons for different play styles, and most weapons have some sort of a more rare upgraded version:
Do you like firing fast? Get an SMG (or Thomas Gun) or a Pistol (or Silenced Pistol)
Do you like instantly destroying people up close? Grab a Shotgun (or JAG-7)
Prefer to pick off people from a distance? Get a Hunting Rifle (or Sniper Rifle)
Hunting rifle too slow? Get a Magnum (or Deagle)
Want to track enemies? Get a Bow and Sparrow (or Sparrow Launcher)
Want to remove multiple people from the game really fast? The minigun is super fun
Like healing teammates or doing poison damage that completely ignores armor? Grab a dart gun
Like explosions? Grab some grenades


You have so many options for playing this game or trying new things. You can hold two weapons (besides melee and grenades), so try mixing and matching and see what you like most. There are no wrong answers here (though holding TWO shotguns probably isn't the best strategy, but you CAN do it if you want to!). It's not really a rock-paper-scissors sort of game, either, since you can hold both the ""rock"" and ""scissors"" at the same time.

There are also a wide variety of places to go in this game, and the map design overall is really good and has a lot of content in it for you to explore and find more stuff in. And, yeah, there's actually lore in this game! Cool, huh??

The community is also pretty good here, especially outside of the game, though the in-game chat pre-game can be... weird. Let's just say it's not moderated very well.

Community interaction is something the developers do a pretty good job at, and they're especially good with content creators like streamers and people who make videos.

The soundtrack by Jake Butineau is also really good. You can get it on Bandcamp or listen to it on Spotify or YouTube. I recommend giving it a listen!


This game is free-to-play. But spending money DOES grant you access to more content.

Here's the usual preface that the game makes clear: There is absolutely no gameplay advantage or incentive to actually spend money on this game. In fact, not even the free unlocks do anything to gameplay. Your character, gameplay-wise, is the same the first time you play the game as it will be the 1000th time. So, being a tap dancing cyberpunk tiger wielding a giant axe will not make you any more or less powerful than the default fox. And the Default Dance is the best dance, anyway!

HOWEVER, if you don't buy the Super Edition (around $15 at the time of writing this), some milestones (therefore, some unlockable cosmetics) are not available to you. Of course, the game will track your stats, so if you DO decide to buy it later, you can simply go back and click ""Unlock"" on all of the milestones you unlocked. Also, while there are loads of free stuff you can unlock, it's worth noting that Carl coins drop twice as much with the Super Edition, which means some of these free unlocks may take longer to get if you don't have it than if you did. I don't consider this one-time thing a ""microtransaction"" since it's a one-time purchase that gets you a large portion of the game.

But yes, like many free-to-play games (or even paid games nowadays), this game ALSO has a premium currency (""SAW tickets""). There are no gambling mechanics, and anything that can be unlocked through gameplay - which is most things - CANNOT be unlocked through microtransactions (and vice versa). Not everyone is OK with microtransactions (and if you aren't, you've probably made up your mind about the game at this point!), but it's at the very least an honest system Pixile has here.


This game is fun to play over and over again! While it has risen in popularity recently, it's not MASSIVELY popular yet, with typically only around 500-1500 players online depending on what time you play the game. So, you may find that games can often take between 2-4 minutes to fill. It does have bots, meaning you're going to be seeing people like ""Dave from Sales"" and ""Not a bot"" a lot in here. Bots provide a fair challenge, but once you figure out how they work, they're pretty easy to deal with (unless you're alone against a group of bots... oh dear).

So, I'm going to give this game a recommendation! The core gameplay is quite fun, and it's free, so there's nothing to lose by merely trying it. Other battle royales didn't really click for me, but this game sure does!",Recommended,221,0

I am bad at Fornite.....really bad! I am old, slow, my eyes are not as sharp as they once were and my reflexes are not what they once were! So, Battle Royale games are not as user friendly for me as they seem to be for the twenty something gamer that just seems to excel at the aforementioned genre. With that said, I really like Super Animal Royale! It harkens back to the older days of gaming and the top down view is just what I needed to be able to compete on an even level with the young-uns. No peering off across half the map to try to see a dot I need to snipe as it runs and zig zags toward me to end my virtual life. I cannot stress enough how fun this game is to play! In the end, like every other Battle Royale game, it comes down to who gets the best weapon first.",Recommended,109,2

As a middle-aged mom having a midlife crisis as a wannabe gamer, Super Animal Royale is a refreshing combination of challenging competition and whimsical critters with a bit of satire thrown into the mix. I was frustrated with the sweaty TTVs and soccer skins in Fortnite and played for months without a single win. I stumbled upon SAR while browsing Steam's summer sale, and after only a couple weeks, I achieved several wins and just today earned two pacifist wins. If this arthritic old maid can score some wins in Super Animal Royale, a monkey could do it.
It's a cute, addicting battle royale with a refreshing exterior and 2D view. Pixile Studios is consistently pushing out fresh updates with new cosmetics and content that entices a growing audience and keeps founding members interested. I highly recommend shelling out a few bucks to add this gem to your gaming collection!",Recommended,101,0

I'm really not a fan of the battle royale genre in general, but I guess this game actually managed to warm my cold, dead heart (if only a little bit). The relatively quick matches (for that authentic ""just one more game"" experience), very balanced meta, and endearing art style are great. Probably one of the most things about this game is that there's no unrewarding lootbox-laden microtransaction crap in here. You pay $12 and get the full and complete game, no strings attached. Not to mention that there's the Super Free Version, a demo with no gameplay restrictions, and with any cosmetics earned carrying over to the full game. You really couldn't ask for better monetization in a game like this.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
A Battle Royale game for people who don't like Battle Royale games. I've read a good few comments in the chat where people say this is their favorite Battle Royale, and I'd have to agree. Matches are quick and gear is plentiful enough so you can kit yourself out with a viable loadout shortly after dropping. You may or may not have the highest tier gear, but it does not take long to find something that suits your style or the situation and you can dive right into the gunplay. Different weapons work better in different situations, so there is some thought that goes into what to cary. Shotties are devistating at close range. The AK and the uzi are both automatic weapons, but the AK is superior at longer ranges while the uzi's rate of fire will out-damage the AK when close up (provided you land your shots). Sniper rifles do heavy damage and will eat the opponent's armor, leaving them vulnerable. Half of the battle is just using the right tactics for the right situation.

In SAR, encounters are frequent enough to keep things interesting and the pacing of the storm always keeps you moving. Of course battles can and will end as quickly as they start and send you right back to the title screen, but I've had fun every time.

Check out the free version and give it a go.
(If you enjoy the game, the full version gives you access to all the cosmetics you unlocked. It doesn't give you a competitive edge, but you get to look pretty and it supports development :P)",Recommended,54,0

Let me start by saying I like the whole gameplay loop, as well as the lack of pay-to-win mechanics in the game.

I am however, not recommending this game due to a bad experience with the community in game, and the mods on discord.

I was playing SOLO games today, and people were teaming up. A group of 4 players were teaming up, not killing each other, attacking me, and helping each other win in SOLO matches. I couldn't report fast enough in the game & it was about the whole team, so I just went to the discord and wrote up the story. It took me 10 or so minutes to write it up in a very thorough and detailed manner. When I posted it in discord a mod instantly deleted my post which took me considerable time and effort to write.. in an attempt to help them with their game! Worst off, the mod and other people in the Discord ""thanked me"" by accusing me of starting a witch hunt, mocking my name in discord etc. I instantly left the discord server.

I'm sad because I was enjoying this game and have gotten into it over the last week with my girlfriend and my other friend.

Mods, please don't allow your discord mods to flame people reporting genuine bad behaviour. Also, please don't allow teaming up in solo. It's absolutely gamebreaking.",Not Recommended,593,0

The shortest way to describe it is ""Fortnite but Furry"", but there's more to it than that.

Yes, it's a battle royale, but there's no building, and it's a top down game, so there's not a massive skill gap like in Fortnite; that is to say if I lose in this game, it's because I was bested in battle, not because my opponent built a 5-star hotel with WiFi at me then sniped me from the other end of the map.

Also you unlock more skins either through random drops for cosmetics or by leveling up and creating the animals you want, no real money past the initial purchase.

All in all, this is what a Battle Royale game should be, in my opinion.

Oh and I can be my fursona so I mean, solid recommendation from me.",Recommended,133,0

This is not just the most adorable and wholesome way ever to slaughter each other, this is also a game where everything about payments and rewards feels so considerative and appreciative towards the players.

The amount of playable characters and cosmetics you can unlock just by playing (even without getting the Super Edition) is incredible. Even if you lose matches frequently it still feels rewarding. You know about those things called Season Pass in games like those? (Ofc you know, it is a rethorical question. :P) Usually you have to decide if it is actually worth paying for the upgraded version to get all the rewards out of them, because you don't know if you have enough playing time to actually finish them and get everything out of them. Not in this game though - no oh. Here you can finish each and every single pass you paid for and can even have two of them active at once. You can pay for old passes and still just see them through if you like at any time.

You don't pay for the chance of maybe getting everything you paid for in time. You pay for getting everything you paid for in you own pace and time. This is something that deserves a lot of praising cause I've never ever before seen something like that. Are they trying to make money with it? Ofc - They worked hard on it. Are they trying to squeeze every penny out of their players to make a somewhat enjoyable experience while playing possible? No, they do not and we should all love 'em for that.",Recommended,36 people found this review helpful 3,0

One of the least stressful, simplest and quickest battle royales I've seen. Winning is nice but just getting to a top placement feels nearly as good, and really feels like we were out-strategized and out-skilled each time.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
A well-polished 2D BR with an FPS feel to it
Disclaimer: Have spent over 60 hours playing the game since Alpha and am now a community mod. This is sort of a review/guide hybrid.

Tl;dr: Super Animal Royale is a smooth overhead 2D BR with an FPS feel owing to unique sightline mechanics and solid sound design as well as short rounds. It’s both a battle royale for people that don’t like battle royales and also a great game for vets tired of the usual grind.

Super Animal Royale (SAR) catches your eye at first with the well-done character art and beautiful environments. It’s not overly detailed to the point of turning into static noise, yet every item in the game looks lovingly crafted with unique features. The game is easier to approach than most other BRs and serves as a great entry-point into the genre. At the same time, there is plenty to learn and figure out as you get better and ascend to the top of the food chain more and more often.

The super animals are essentially bipedal versions of their species that can dance and use lethal weaponry. And there are a variety of weapons that are easily recognizable and do about what you would expect from them. As well as some unique standouts like a rideable hamster ball that can take down others at full speed and bananas that slip players up. Yet more powerful weapons exist with some only found in the occasional drops from a mole that appears at random on the map.
You start off with a few animals unlocked and others yet to be researched through DNA you obtain by playing matches.

The different animals all have the same hitboxes and stats so any difference is purely cosmetic. There is plenty of clothing, items, emotes, dances etc. that drop randomly at the end of a round. I appreciate this model as it keeps the playing field level by giving you all gameplay related features right off the bat and limiting unlocks to cosmetics. And no loot boxes unlike certain other games.

The map is sizeable with plenty of different environments to explore. From a claustrophobic swamp with its many bridges to navigate to a frozen over tundra to a research facility where they [REDACTED]. There’s definitely a living world here with plenty of lore to uncover. And there to ignore if you wish to focus more on the gameplay. It is also quite navigable by foot without feeling stranded just because you lack a vehicle.

The gameplay differentiates itself from 2D battle royales in part by having a line of sight system. While the game is presented in an overhead view, you don’t automatically have full knowledge of everything on the screen. Trees, rocks, houses, and even stacked crates can obscure your vision. This allows for tense situations where you have to rely on the game’s sound to figure out where you opponents are.

And what a great sound design this game has. Everything sounds pleasant to the ears and feels crisp. Figuring out where shots come from is pretty easy and also essential to staying alive. Rolling, running, and crouch walking all have varying levels of sound. While you might wish to roll forward towards an enemy, doing so close to them will be quite audible and give away your position.

Also worth mentioning is that running will reduce your weapon accuracy. Crouch walking and standing both help out in landing shots, but also expose you to enemy fire. Learning to balance aim accuracy while on the go will be key to surviving. Most of the time you can get away with reasonable accuracy while running, but it is sometimes worth slowing down and aiming a few key shots with your magnum or sniper. The shooting is ultimately more arcadey than realistic so don’t worry too much.

The pacing of this game stands out from other BRs. SAR takes no more than ten minutes to finish a single round which is often just the start of the midgame in similar titles. Dying after a few minutes of looting is far less frustrating than spending 20 minutes running around just to die to a random headshot. This is the ultimate game for when you’re waiting on someone or something and just want to get a quick match in.

The core battle royale mechanics are all here. Up to 64 super animals launch from an eagle flying across the map. You choose where to jump off and conveniently the game also tells you when fellow teammates eject. There is an ever shrinking circle outside of which you take damage. There is a healing mechanic that is streamlined wherein you gather health items that are added to a health juice bottle that you carry around. Plenty of items to be found lying around. There’s several degrees of armor. And you can currently queue up in Europe, North America, or Asia as either a solo player, with another person, or in a 4-person squad.

And lastly, the game just feels smooth. From the animations to gunplay to the actual game running on my computer. You can run this thing on pretty much any computer released in the past decade and it’ll run perfectly. There’s been a ton of optimization since the game’s launch and your average modern gaming rig will max this easily with plenty of power to spare. Look down on games that can’t run at least 300fps smoothly at all times? SAR’s got you covered. Dislike sloppy networking code that robs you of kills? SAR performed reasonably well even when I tried playing it on the Asian servers all the way from New York (~230ms ping).

This game is just polished to an insane degree considering the small team size and the fact that this is their first such title on PC/MAC. They have been incredibly responsive on their discord when it comes to bugs and feature requests. The game’s grown from a small map with scant items to multiple biomes and a full arsenal in a fairly short time. I’m reasonably optimistic about expecting more of the same in the months of early access to come. Given the low entry price, I feel that I’ve already gotten my money’s worth in the alpha/beta tests. And with more features promised in the future, it already feels like a steal.",Recommended,70,0

Super Animal Royale, or SAR for short, is a great not-so violent take on the popular genre. SAR does a great job of providing an set of good intuitive controls that gives it's easy to pick up and play appeal.

On the surface, SAR comes off mildly childish. You see this with the lack of blood splashing everywhere, the play-on-words dead screen send offs and a light-hearted poof as your gravestone appears. Your chosen animal, of which there are diverse choices which stand out from each other, can be customized with evolutions and various stylish clothing choices. Skins can be obtained through Easter Eggs, completing some PvP tasks or through an in-game shop with a micro-transaction option in addition as a way to spend currency earned through playing the game.

Overall the gameplay is rather simple to pickup, and genuinely feels rewarding when you get better at the game. The base controls feel almost perfect, but none the less the items, weapon variation, special ability, utility item and health consumables are nicely implemented and fairly balanced. Time to Kill can vary greatly, but skill is a major factor in quick kills, your own luck also appears to have a devastating effect on time to kill mechanics also.

With a smooth solid game play experience that is youth friendly, this title can be expected to deliver countless hours of replay-ability.",Recommended,26 people found this review helpful 3,1

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",Recommended,123,0

This is a fantastic low barrier to entry Battle Royale experience. The short match length, quick load times and overall silly demeanor work to defuse the ticking time bomb of frustration that most battle royales give you. You can die and be back in a new game in ~1 minute which makes the whole thing feel fresh and exciting. A surprisingly good example of the genre.",Recommended,29 people found this review helpful 1,0

Alright so I've seen a lot of my friends finally start playing this game so I might as well write this review.

I've been addicted to this game for a while now and there are only a couple of small issues with the game that aren't game breaking. The game is fun, a lot of fun with friends. It's the only battle royale game I like and I dont feel bad about playing it often.

I've met a ton of friends on this game as well, some insanely close friends and I always look forward to playing it with them. The developers of this game are also so kind and caring and I'm glad to even know a couple.

This is definitely a game worth your time to check out, it's free as well so why not give it a try?

Update for the game awards. This game is still worth the amount of hours I have in it.",Recommended,28,0

I don't normally recommend games or anything of that nature but if anyone's out there looking for a casual/chill and also incredibly silly/cute then this is it. It's a Battle Royale (I know, believe me I don't care for BR games either since they're practically overdone at this point) but it's free on steam no pay to win features and it's really easy. Runs on literally anything i'd imagine. Also the community on their discord is the nicest group of people i've ever met.",Recommended,27,0

It's a really cute and undoubtedly adorable game. Well done and with a beautiful and probably nostalgic beginning.
Unfortunately, if you become a pro player the community will do everything to get you banned. (salty).
I suggest using a random name and not your nickname or brand.
- Some developers don't do their job.
- Being toxic like a ♥♥♥♥ is normal, even though the rules say to be good and loving with the other players.
- A fake screen can ruin your account. Because developers believe in 3rd category photoshop pics.
- They accuse players without a specific reason.
- One of the worst communities in history in my opinion.
Play this game only with your friends. I'm the highest level of the game and I have the most experience in this game.

Straight to the point. Only 10 hours on the game when i've made this review.

PROS:
-A lot of fun
-Is not a p2w game, you can buy in game fashion/gun skins or you can buy the battlepass.
-I have a 6 old pc , and the game has 100 fps. So YES you bi*ches with low ass mf pc's can play finally a battle royale
but u have to play it with low shadows + a low resolution.
-Friendly comunnity. I had a problem with my game, reported the bug on discord, after 10 mins the developer talked to me. So yes, very very friendly.
-Addictive af, literally i downloaded it , played 1 hour. The next day played 9 hours.
-The community is going to grow, i'm pretty sure of that.
-Every thing is cute, animals/guns/skins , the UI is very simple , not hard to understand, maybe a lot of things will be added like rank games/guild/another game modes , very funny.


-A lil tryhard , ngl im tryharding myself so i can be only #1
-Very addictive, and yes there is a pro and a con, spended a lot of time lmao.
-You level up kinda hard ngl, there are like 900 levels? or smth like that, in 10 hours i only made lvl 17. But with the daily quests and the weekly quests u can actually lvl up a little more faster

Y'all have everything here, but i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME. 10/10",Recommended,24 people found this review helpful 0,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Well, I'm over level 2300 and 2000+ hours in, guess I should edit this review to reflect that...

SAR is one of my all-time most-played games at this stage, up there with Diablo II, WOW, Warcraft 3 and Rome Total War. I have quit a couple of times but keep coming back. Why? Mostly it's because I made so many nice friends in this game and miss them whenever I stay away. But it's also just good fun, exciting, cute and enough of a challenge to keep you engaged.

I've played a lot of online games in my time and this still one has one of the nicest little communities you could hope to find. There are many kind, funny, friendly people. It's a game where shy players can feel comfortable, unlike other online arena games which are often toxic cesspits full of rude children. It is rare to come across a truly toxic player in SAR, and the mods will take your reports seriously.

The animation and sound design are both incredibly charming, which helps to create a pleasant atmosphere.

Some of my favourite games as a kid were top-down shoot 'em ups, so I have a place in my heart for this kind of game. I'm a fan of retro graphics and in many ways prefer this simple style to modern 'realistic'-looking games. Both graphically and in gameplay, SAR brings back the simple fun and heart that early computer games overflowed with, whilst still having the QOL features and polish you'd expect from a 21st century online shooter.

The gameplay cycle is easy to learn, but as a newbie you should be prepared to die a lot - there are lots of us who have spent a long time gitting gud at SAR and with no system for level-based matching, you will find yourself with a challenge at peak hours.

Fortunately, if you get a good group of mates together, dying can be almost as funny and fun as winning. Just try to have fun and don't take it too seriously! The cute graphics really help. My advice is to maybe test the game out in the rotating modes (SVR and Bwoking) to get a feel for gunplay and movement; watch how more experienced players move, learn what spots and weapons work well, etc etc. If you are polite and friendly, you'll find players who are happy to help you improve.

Is it perfect? No, it has its problems, but no game is perfect. The weapon balance is pretty good at this stage. I would like to see more focus on the BR aspect, as the devs have switched a lot of resources to the time limited modes for a while... but on the other hand, I'd also like to see pure DM and/or TDM modes added for when you just want some brainless action.

It is perfectly possible to enjoy this game without paying a single penny, but I bought the founder's pack and super edition at full price to support the devs as I think they've made a wonderful little gem here. I've bought every season starter pack and will continue to support this game as long as they keep putting their love into it.",Recommended,20 people found this review helpful 1,3

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
great game, loved hotline miami and this lets me show off my hotline skills. for early access, very little bugs.

10/10 but hopefully non-furries eventually play this game

EDIT: So, after 300 hours, I got one major issue with this game and i wrote all this text cause of it.

TL;DR: separating the game into ""super free edition"" and a purchased version alienates f2p users, confuses prospective players, and ultimately slows the growth of the userbase. i know thats a mouthful but ima go through it lol.

-being f2p sucks. you can't queue up with friends through steam, only through discord. this means that even if just ONE of your friends doesnt have the full version, ya gotta all leave your steam lobby and create a new discord lobby and invite your friend that way... which is buggy. half the time the person can't see the invite on discord, you gotta switch the lobby host around and it's really just a pain (I just started buying people the game cause its ridiculous).

-so far, ive gotten about 15 people to try out this game, and roughly half of them have gotten confused when I told them it was free. And if you look at the store page, first thing they see is that it costs $12.99. then, they see that theres only a demo of the game. after that, when they open the demo to try out the game, they see “BUY THE FULL VERSION!” all over. not a great first impression.

I asked a SAR mod about this, and they said the purpose of separating versions like that is that F2P games get less exposure on steam… but is steam’s purpose to market your game? I think that’s where the community, youtube, and streaming come in… which brings me to my next point.

recently, ive been playing many games where there are only about 8 people in the game. 8 real people, and 56 bots. even on peak hours, just 25-30 people. I think its important to note, usually most of the people wearing cosmetics. Barely any F2P’s… the newbies that might actually BUY the game.

as of now, I think the community isn’t growing as fast as it should be… even if the game is only a year old, and even considering it’s still in early access. In the past, decent-sized youtubers and streamers (and even deadmau5!)... have brought new traffic, but we’re still out here playin in smaller lobbies than the week before.

I think this is where I restate my thesis. Frankly, I think seperating the two editions is stunting the growth of this game. Yes, I think F2P should get steam lobby invites, the base level gray cosmetics, and more animal customizations, cause unlike 3d battle royales, you gotta look at your guy a LOT. Yes, I think pixile is using a business model from 10 years ago. Yes, I really like this game and I just want it to do well.
Anyway, there’s my 3-point essay. Just had to get that off my chest. Forgot the hook tho. Its whatever.

Still 10/10.",Recommended,33,0

Super Animal Royale is a third-person shooter battle royale, where you play as a furry animal fighting to be the last animal standing in a battle royale arena. You can play alone or with a team of up to four. The game is divided up into 3 game modes: Solos, Duos, and Squads, based on the number of players in your party. A fourth game mode, SAW vs. Rebels, is a 32 vs 32 mode that is occasionally available as well.

The gameplay is pretty fun. There are a variety of weapons to find and choose from in the world, so there are options to suit your play style. The Epic and Legendary weapons are hard to find in the world, so you won't find them every game, but all of the weapons in the lowest 3 tiers are pretty abundant, so it shouldn't be too hard to explore and find what you need. It definitely takes some practice to get to know the map and get better at surviving, but winning is definitely possible, especially in the modes where you have teammates to back you up.

The backstory to the game is fun and is subtly incorporated into the map. There are fun little Easter eggs you can find, some of which come with bonus skins you can wear in game. The gameplay itself really doesn't have any story-related elements to it, even SAW vs. Rebels, but the backstory you can get from exploring the map is a fun bonus on top of the gameplay.

The biggest weakness of the game is the small playerbase. Almost every game you get will have some bots in the match. At peak times there might only be 10-20 bots needed to fill a 60 player lobby, but in off hours there might only be 10-20 human players in the lobby. Games with bots aren't that bad, as the bots usually end up killing each other or getting killed by players early on and the end of the game has a bunch of human players facing off. However, the games with more humans are much more unpredictable and fun, so more players will help the game improve.

The game has gone completely free-to-play in an effort to expand the player base, and in that regard it has been somewhat successful, as the player numbers have gone up from what they were when there was a paid version. Now the game is monetized through sales of cosmetics. There are some cosmetics you can obtain for free by playing the game and some that you have to pay for using SAW tickets, a paid in-game currency. I personally have no problem with these kinds of microtransactions, as they don't affect gameplay and you can earn some of the cosmetics through playing. There are also DLC packs which have exclusive animals breeds, emotes, cosmetics, and SAW tickets, or you can just buy the SAW tickets on their own.

Overall, Super Animal Royale is a really fun battle royale shooter that's great to play on your own or with your friends. The game is pretty great now, and I can't wait to see it improve as the player base expands and it's able to support more game modes. 9/10",Recommended,23,0

hi, I'm 43. I used to live (and work) at an animal rehabilitation center. Possums and Raccoons frequented the facility, and we would help them recover from their various addictions (ketamine, cocaine, glue). I've always been an avid fan of animals, hostile and friendly, and this game perfectly encapsulates the feeling I used to get when I walked into the facility every day at 3 am.

Why should you get this game? It's simple - you can bonk animals on the head, and animals can bonk you on the head. I see this as an absolute win.

So

This GORGEOUS little game has had me hooked for well over 500 hours of gameplay thus far, and its still only in early access.
It is every bit as adorable as the trailer would lead you to believe, and the game itself has been highly updated, the devs are VERY passionate and update the game highly regularly, and the game seldom seems to encounter many crashes of downtime.

The REAL gem though, the reason that keeps me playing this game more than the game itself, is the SUPER amazing community that the devs have carefully constructed. By keeping the game strictly PG rated, and enforcing good conduct both in game an in their discord server (which is VERY active), They have managed to cultivate a caring, supporting NONTOXIC community, which is SUPER rare to find in general, let alone in a BR Genre.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

PROS
*Cute adorable fuzzies!
*Many customisation options
*No paywalled content/ lootboxes/microtransactions
*Regular new content
*Active and LOVELY community
*Friendly active Moderators that react quickly to bad situations/drama
*short fast paced matches


Cons
*High learning curve for new players with no matchmaking or seperate areas/lobbies for high skill players and newer players
*NO HOODIES

Super Animal Royale is one of those games that will make you keep playing it after 500+ hours the gameplay is simple yet it can takes so many hours to master it. But let's start form beginning.

So SAR is an Battle Royale with 64 players in one map, it has unique camera placement. Most BR games are first person shooter or third person SAR on the other hand is top down shooter. The game is focused primarily on fast and quick combat, weapons in this game hit like a truck what makes dueling very stressful. Every single match (without dying first) last around 5 to 6 mins max, also the games end so quick that you can hop into one or two matches during your break time. Then we have guns that can literally kill you in a blink of an eye right nothing special but what's more? Well besides dying fast, the gameplay is also focused on the movement, yes your human like animal can turn into a sport car with a simple press of an spacebar, after clicking it your character performs a roll making you move faster for a short period of time and if you press it again in the right moment you gonna move even faster. Keep in mind timing this is kinda tricky.

Next thing that I wanna touch are the graphics. Putting simply the game is adorable and done in cartoony style, most of the unlockable animals are well done and after some time you're gonna have your favs and ones that you probably gonna hate (I'm looking at you hippo) and being honest there is nothing more to add. The graphics are simple but the style is what hook me up in the first place thanks to this game. Oh and did I mention that you can customize your character with items you get after leveling up? Yeah just like in TF2 you have vanity items you can equip on your characters, meaning if you are like me you will end up with 16 pages of loadouts.

Next aspect is community. I played a lot of online games in my past, mostly the popular ones and oh damn I gotta say some of them are known for their community. So when I witnessed how many wholesome people are out there I just could not believe what I saw. The community is small, but is very supportive, friendly and really seeing someone trash talk is an rarity.

The only issue for me is that after playing for some time the game gets stale. Yeah it is one of those easy to learn, hard to master type of games but there isn't that much content. Overall there's not that many different weapons. Updates drop for like every 2 to 3 months adding at most one new location to the map and new battle pass is added and after finishing it there isn't that much stuff to do out there so yeah for some people it might be a big drawback.

But overall the game is worth trying out. Even if some of you might find it not very promising by it's name or by how it looks. The gameplay is addicting and satisfying, the community is something that you don't see much in other titles, what more can I say is that if you've never played it maybe you could give it a shot and see how it works for you?",Recommended,29,5

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Overview of the game in it's current state:
I absolutely loved this game, and I still do, the gameplay is extremely fun, and the artstyle is adorable. However, the most recent update brought along a lot of changes that I personally would say were for the worst. I shall write two reviews, a review of how the game was, and my opinion on it, and a review on how the game is now, and my opinion on it.

My review of the previous versions:
This game is the perfect battle royale to me. It includes all of the best concepts of a battle royale, such as:
60 people free for all, playable in solo, duos, and squads.
Fast, fun, and varied gameplay.
Hundreds of fun and interesting cosmetics.
Addicting.
Great to play with friends.

However, unlike every other battle royale out there, it's missing all of the annoying parts of the typical battle royale, making it so much easier to focus on the best parts. It removes annoying things such as:
Cosmetics which are so expensive you have to pay for them.
A battlepass that you need to grind every day for multiple hours in order to unlock everything.
A toxic or overly competitive community.
Hackers.
A requirement to be generally quite good at aiming and have fast reaction times.
A system that makes it incredibly hard to get any of the cosmetics.

The game does an amazing job at removing all of these problems, simply by not including the most common features that hold back battle royales and makes them feel all the same, such as the ones listed above.
Instead for it's cosmetics it chooses to reward players with random cosmetics every 3-6 games, making the game feel very rewarding to play. Instead of grinding out to get currency, just so you can buy a skin you wanted on the store before it leaves until who knows when, you have no choice in the matter, and simply are given random items, some you want, some you don't. But no matter what you get, you have an extra fun thing to play around with when customising your character.

For it's games it even includes bots to fill out the remaining players, which makes it very common to fight these bots, which for a new player can be super fun and thrilling, while also being an easy enough fight for you to get used to the controls as you practice fighting them. But there can still be enough of them to take a skilled player down too.

Because of these two things, mixed with the fact that the game is a one time purchase, with no money-hungry decisions to be seen the game, it allows the game to feel extremely relaxed and fun, allowing even the most casual of players to fully enjoy and become addicted in this game.

Overall, it is the best battle royale, because of it's courage to stand out from the croud with no micro-transactions to be seen, and a fun, quick, addicting but also casual gameplay experience.



What positive changes were made:
I personally believe that the new UI is very nice, if not a bit cluttered. However, overall the new UI looks more professional over the previous one, so that is a plus.
It also added a lot of colour weapon skins that can be unlocked from killing a certain amount of players with those weapons, which is a very fun and encouraging update.
Unfortunately that's all I can praise from all of the changes, as even the new game mode that was added is very confusing and cluttered, and personally it isn't fun for a casual player.

What this update/version of the game ruined/did wrong:
To put in in as little words as possible, all of the previous praise I had for the game is gone. It now has micro-transactions, which feel extremely overpriced, especially considering previously the game only cost £10 to have everything in the game for you to unlock with no extra cost. It also has a battlepass, which is paid for with the premium currency, is very long and grindy to unlock items, and you don't even earn enough currency from completing it to get your money back.

Furthermore, this new paid battlepass removes the casual-friendly aspect of this game, making everyone who plays hungry for exp to not waste their battlepass, so you're a lot more likely to encounter full lobbies with players that will stop at nothing, and probably have 1000's of hours in the game more than you.

The random cosmetic drops which made the game feel so fun and rewarding has now also been placed with a shop of randomly shifting daily cosmetics, as to be expected from a battle royale game, and instead of getting a random cosmetic every 3-6 games, you get a small amount of coins per game, and it'll most likely take up to 15 games now just to be ale to buy one of the most cheap cosmetics on sale in the shop, that you probably don't even want.

Overall I feel that the game is now a lot worse, and I will continue playing once the squads gamemode has been added back in to see if that feels as fun as it once was, but overall the tone of the game is worse, the value for money is immensely worse, the reward for playing is worse, and it just feels like the game is forcing you to become addicted, rather than allowing you to play it at your own pace.



If I had to suggest a way to fix this, I would propose that the shop should be replaced with a catalogue of every item in the game, and simply allow players to save up for anything that they want, instead of tempting them by the randomness of the shop with an item they may never see again. As well as this, more of the currency should be rewarded, and if the battlepass is going to be paid, then it should at least give the player back the amount the spent on it, if they complete it. While quite hopeful and unrealistic, I would also want to see a ""Premium DLC"" or something, costing maybe £50 or so, just to have the battlepass not be paid for, maybe double exp drops, and maybe infinite premium currency, or at least a large amount.

I feel it is not worth complaining too much about the new changes and instead just offering suggestions as to how the new changes could be improved to keep the game how the developers want it, while also making it still enjoyable for fans of the previous versions. Currently I am very unhappy with the game in its current state and I will probably not play it nearly as much. I hope this review didn't come across as too negative or whiny, I simply want to give my opinion on the game and its new update from the opinion of a casual player, who loved the previous versions, but not the new game.

Idk how to end this thing so, bye I guess lol.",Not Recommended,56,2

This is my first review and probably my only review ever-

I love this game. I love that it's cute and I love that it gives everyone the chance to play the game for free and once you buy the game there's nothing else you need to buy for cosmetics like most battle royales! The game is adorable, the community is nice and I've made lots of friends with people in-game and streamers. The game is easy to play and easy to get into and I don't think I'll see myself not playing this game anytime soon. I went ahead and bought the founder's edition just because I think out of most games I've played this game is the one that deserves money the most. It's well developed, fun, not money hungry like most battle royales and the community is a blast!

With shorter rounds than many other battle royale games and plenty of free cosmetics to make yourself look fine as heck, Super Animal Royale is a fun game to play with friends. It's only gotten better through the time it's been in development, but support is still lacking. Having to join a discord server to report any cheating or unsavory players and having the game released for free means that the game is full of players who make the game less fun for the rest of us.",Recommended,22,0

I never write reviews for games, ever. But because I have 1300+ hours in this game, I feel like I can make a review that people should definitely consider.

This game is an absolute blast to play casually.

There's a reason why I come back to this game and just play it out of spite. It has a fantastic concepts, with great execution. I think the way to truly enjoy this game is to play with friends because you will die, a lot. And dying isn't fun in any game anyways so losing together and winning together is definitely the way to go. That being said, I'll move over to why I wouldn't recommend playing this game more than you think you should.

I have played this game for around 3 years at this point, since late May of 2019. I've watched this game transform in many ways. Both for the better and for the worse. I won't get in depth with everything, but I will mention the biggest issues that are still applicable as of writing this review.


I think the number one reason for this is because of the game's lag. In most of other games, lag is a disadvantage because of the fact you respond slower to enemy actions. But in Super Animal Royale, lag can actually be an advantage. I won't go completely in depth with how the net code and lag system works, but in the simplest words: if you hit the enemy on your screen, it counts. This is a huge issue (and I have over 40 video clips to back me up here) due to the fact that if you're trying really hard to learn the best skills and mechanics in getting good at this game (bullet dodging, efficient movement, leading aim, best load-outs, etc), then it becomes almost useless if you're facing against someone who's lagging. They will end up hitting you on their screen with their bullets, when on your screen, their bullets are missing and whiffing pass you. This becomes extremely annoying after it starts to happen consistently against you, and ends up making you lose matches because of it. Also to mention, people can lag so hard that they end up having jagged movement, causing you to miss a lot of your own shots.

I've also been the one to care for the numbers and statistics of weapon damage, METAs, and overall competitiveness of the game. And when I take a look at the current state of weapon balance, it's not good. There's always different types of playstyles in order to have better chances in winning against certain weapons, but most of time, it doesn't matter against automatic weapons, AK being the worst to play against. Now I'm not here to keep elaborating on every single reason why each and every weapon can be fixed, but I will say a couple. Shotguns and JAG-7s need to have lower bullet range (like seriously who thought a shotgun can be a long range weapon AND completely destroy level 3 armor, actually unbelievable). Sniper rifles need a revamp in recoil where slowing down and scoping in has significantly better accuracy than just straight pulling the weapon out of your pocket while super rolling all over the place and firing a straight lazer to your opponent. BCG has a tracer now, why does the bow not have a tracer? They're both charge up weapons, what makes the BCG have it and the bow doesn't? The crossbow kind of needs a buff if its going to be considered an epic/legendary weapon since the main issue being it can't take down people fast enough especially with its clip size being so small, even the Bow would be a better choice because of the fact it can infinitely shoot. Both the Bow and Crossbow almost serve the same purpose in the game, just the Bow being a straight upgrade. AKs, SMGs, M16s, Tommys, all auto weapons need some sort of nerf. I'm not saying to lower down their damage or fire rate directly. That's not what they need. They need some sort of counter play to those who click and hold their mouse down while spraying and praying to win the game. Because it legit is that easy to win the game as long as you have an AK. I can suggest adding a throwable item that slows down the rate of fire of the opponent's weapon to counter automatic weapons. All other weapons are completely fine as is. However, I do wish that there weren't just new weapons that are just upgrades of other weapons. For example, the Deagle is just a better Magnum. Why add a new weapon if it's just the same weapon but better? Same applies with the AK and M16. It makes no sense to me to add a new weapon that is quite literally the same exact thing. Also another thing to mention is to balance the movement speeds of each weapon, biggest issue being JAG-7 users who run at 100mph with only needing 2 shots to kill people.

I would also like to mention another issue with this game, that being the micro transactions.
There are a couple of things you can purchase with real money in game, all of which are cosmetics that do not provide a pay-to-win advantage. The premium currency in this game are SAW Tickets, which like other games, can buy you premium cosmetics that are unattainable through playing the game alone, or used to buy the Animal Pass (battle pass). Now let's take a closer look at the pricing.
You can basically just say that for $1, you can get 100 tickets. I am currently looking at the shop for what you can buy and, theres a fork in the game you can hold as a melee weapon for 500 tickets. An entire $5 for one single item you can hold, and you're probably like not going to even hold it for a while because you need to hold guns instead to kill. Lets go ahead and compare it with something like the cost of Undertale, which is $10. There are also other things you can buy such as a single mini pet in the game for 750 tickets. We can also compare it to another aspect of the game, that being the Animal Pass. The current Animal Pass is only 550, and if you end up completing it, you get 29 different cosmetics, a bunch of Carl Coins (which can be used to buy even more cosmetics), a mini pet, and get 350 Tickets back. So for basically 200 Tickets, you can get all of that. Now that is what the game's micro transactions should be. Just like how I have played Rocket League in the past, cars were only a dollar each (they aren't anymore but that's besides the point). And even then, I was able to trade up a few of my Rocket Pass items away to obtain the next pass and continue my pass.
In essence, SAR's battle passes are good, but buying single cosmetic items are way too costly.


It's completely valid to try and improve on winning in this game, but just remember that you will have those lost games you should have won.

Hopefully this helps!

Alright, I don't think I made it clear enough, my bad. I'm not trying to say that this is a bad game. It is a fabulous game for casual players like 99% of the community. It's fun to play with friends, and just a great game to play if you're running out of ideas. This game is extremely addictive, and in all ways, a well rounded one. I'm only not recommending this game to those who wish to see the game in a different light, the light I wanted to shed it on aka the competitive side of it. I know that there's also a player base who want to genuinely get good at games, and for those of you who want to get good at it, this isn't for you for the reasons I have stated above. Thus why I don't recommend it because I am a competitive player myself.",Not Recommended,116,30

This is the most competitive, uncompetitive Battle Royale game I've played. Seriously, this game is absolutely amazing. From the simple graphic and map layout design. To the locations of guns, ammo, healing from campire/coconuts/health juice, banan(as) vs. grenades, variety of cosmetics and weapons. There is always something to do. Grinding for more DNA and Serum to unlock skins for different animals in the game. Level Up, Collect DNA and Serum to get them all! More animals, skins, DNA conversion, etc in the future. This truly is a game worth buying. It also has controller support, solo/duo/SQUAD and SawVRebellion! - This also has cross party! This review will surely be updated as time passes.

There is small bugs that the Devs are truly passionate about listening for feedback and their discord is a great place to hang out in and get to know the community and staff.

**NOT P2W (Pay 2 Win) ** - You can get cosmetics through simply playing the game, earning coins and getting items from the Carl's Shop, or spend money on Tickets to get items. There is also a battle pass that may change in ticket price over time. This is the early stages of these concepts currently! Cosmetics is for visual only, nothing will help gain wins/skill. Simply play, learn the ropes, look at YouTube and steam community guides to help.

A stripped-down and super-fun top-down battle royale with super-cute animal characters weilding AK47s trying to avoid skunk gas.

Matches are very fast-paced compared to the norm for BR games which is enjoyable. Not to mention that it plays well on both K/M and controller, and microtransactions aren't pay-to-win.

I'm a bit worried about the possible longevity of this game since it is a bit on the simple side, but for a free download it is a blast to play and well worth trying, even if you're only remotely interested. Or if you've been burned out on the genre's typically long per-match runtime and are looking for something similar but a bit quicker and lighter, this could well fill that niche for you without the potential time commitment for each match.",Recommended,23,0

It's really a simple game. Formula is typical for a BR: Pregame lobby, everyone teleports into a plane, then drops somewhere they choose.

Notable things, and why I've been enjoying it:
-It's simple. Not bloated with any crazy gameplay features (Building, classes, etc.)
-Guns are responsive. Gameplay in general is snappy and satisfying.
-Community is small, but VERY friendly. I haven't had any encounters with toxic players here (Though maybe that will change with time)
-Collecting all the animals and clothing is fun, since the game has a really appealing aesthetic.

This game is super amazing and fun to play. Ever since i bought Super Animal Royale ive been playing it daily and for a long time. It always started alittle boring since i didnt know what to do and expect but the more i played the more fun i had playing it. The more i played it, the more friends i kept encountering to be friends with and play together. Playing with friends in this game makes this game 200% more fun. Super animal royale also has its super funny moments to be seen at any moment. Im sure there is alot of new players that dont expect alot and get bored easily and dont play anymore but, Super Animal Royale is filled with surprises too i can say. Its Always nice to see more new players everyday because it basically shows the game still gets funded and players to build the community. To add all to conclusion, Super Animal Royale is worth the money and being gifted to because its such a great game with new content and a lovely community.

Don't get me wrong.. I LOVE this game, I am lvl 1000+, play it constantly and have 1500 hours in it. This game in-and-of-itself? Super fun, addictive, and just overall great and I love it.

However.. The community sucks and there are a lot of minor things making this game hard to play. The few things that are the games fault itself:

-art contest(s) are rigged and pretty much a top 7 not a top 21 (the same people win over and over, and I have a hard time believing with 500+ entries that that was a mistake). I feel like it's just a way to not pay the artists they want to win, but who knows. I think they should avoid having the same people win cuz it gives people (ESPCIALLY KIDS) false hope of winning the contest, and trying their best just for flavorrr and Pome to win for the 6th time in a row.

-Im not sure about damage or gun balance but, from my personal experience, it's pretty badly balanced if surviving on a pixel of HP is common in your game, you can survive by a pixel in other games, however it's shocking and fun/funny when you do. In SAR it just feels like you got scammed or scammed someone else.

-The hamster balls are laggy af, and half the time I die to them, on my screen they were no where near me (this is also on my closest server).

-They have pride stuff in game, but if you say ""im gay"" or anything similar. You get a warning and possibly muted for 24hours. That.. is disgusting. When I complained about it they told me ""i was engaging in adult conversation"" which just sounds like the homophobic argument of ""don't tell the kids the ""gay"" word. Just overall disappointing and gross.

-There are NO IN GAME PENALTIES for dipping on your teammates, or DCing right as a match starts. This is even in other non-competitive games like DBD and such. I have literally seen people DC over and over for HOURS in squads. Just to make it where you are a person down.

-Last big one. When your teammate DCs mid match they aren't replaced by a bot, or anything. They just sit there. Idle. Until they die. Meaning that you, if you are dead, just have to sit and wait. You can't DC because if you do you get none of your ""rewards"" for the match (drops, DNA, XP, ect). That is.. the dumbest thing ever lol.

I love and am passionate about this game, but GOD does it need a clean up.

This isn't even mentioning the lack of balancing, the sweat try hards that ruin playing this game for fun, and.. many other things.

What I do like about this game:

-The gun play is AMAZING. It is SUPER addictive and fun, the guns feel nice to shoot, and that's a key thing in.. yaknow.. a SHOOTING game.

-The devs seem VERY invested in their community and the game they have created. Every update as of late really shows the talent of the team and how hard they work on this game, I cannot say enough this game is amazingly made.

-the gamemode saw vs rebellion was legit the best addition to SAR for me, its my favorite game mode. It's so fun.

-The overall style/aesthetic, SAR is so unique and interesting. I love the world, the art style, really almost everything. Its fun, silly and well put together

Would I recommend this game?

Yes and no. I really think they things that need to be fixed NEED fixing, and to not be rewarded. However, I don't see that happening. So if the things listed aren't a make or break for ya, go for it. The game is fun, and I am sure most people would like SAR.",Not Recommended,113,0

This is possibly the only Battle Royale game I'll ever recommend and for good reason. While it's still relatively new when it comes to BR games, it's got a decent-size playerbase, an active-as-hell Discord, and a quick turnover. That last part is key. It's hard to get salty when your games are done within minutes. Lastly, I'll be biased and admit that the cutesy atmosphere appeals to me overall. Again, hard to be angry when it's a hyena that shoots you. (Unless it's Song. Fear that yeen unless you have a death wish or are teamed up with him.)

On the downside, some of the bots could use some tinkering. At higher levels, you fear the shotgun bot coming after you.

All in all, I'd recommend it if you want a Battle Royale that isn't Fortnite and isn't gonna make you hate everything in a 20-mile radius.",Recommended,20,0

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
A battle royale game for people who don't usually like battle royale games.

PROS

- When my friends recommended I try this game I was genuinely not turned on by the idea, but after trying it I fell in love with it. It is not competitive, and it is easy to learn and get good at and also easy to play for someone like me who isn't good at games like this.

- The free version lets you play the whole game pretty much, minus all cosmetics, and buying the whole game gives you EVERYTHING pretty much, so you don't feel like it is shoving microtransactions down your throat 24/7 like other games love to do.

- The art style is just adorable and very polished. The map is BURSTING with personality in every corner, and you can tell a lot of love was put into this game. The music, though there is very little of it, is also boppin. All of the sound effects are very satisfying and everything wraps it up in an adorable little package of wholesomeness... if you ignore the fact you're murdering each other.

- The community is one of the kindest I have come across in an online game, which is a rare thing. People are welcoming, ready to answer questions, and most are really good sports. I love that this game is not competitive, because it lets you have more fun and really embrace what I think the game really is about... just being adorable animals and doing cute dances as you murder each other. As someone who struggles with my competitive nature, I never once felt angry from losing in this game. In fact, there were times when losing has been more fun than winning.

- the variety of animals and cosmetics is stunning for an early access game! I feel like I still have so much to work towards and I have already unlocked nearly every milestone, and leveled enough to reveal every animal. I enjoy when a game doesn't get stale too fast by running out of things to unlock or work towards achieving, and this game has done well in making unlocking each the animals a grind. I can appreciate that, as it feels like I have really earned them when I finally get to them.

CONS

- If you like competitive hardcore battle royales, this may not be the game for you. This game is definitely for casual players, and you wont find as many challenges. There are very good players in the community, but even they don't seem like they're competing for a leaderboard title.

- Replay value highly depends on what you enjoy on a game. I find it easy to keep playing over and over, but other people I know get bored quick of the same formula over and over again. The game can struggle to stay fresh unless you're working towards something like a new animal, or trying to get a certain cosmetic, or trying to level up.

- There aren't many people playing this game currently. I am not sure how many players will be on when the game finally comes out in full release, but as of now, the most players I have seen in a game has been less than 30 out of the 64 cap. That means matches are full of bots most of the time, and you frequently reach the top 10 whether you're a well practiced player or not. Sometimes it sucks playing with just bots in hours of the day when player traffic is low.

- There is a lot in this game already, but it feels like there should be more! And that is no fault of the game, as it is still early access! I am not including this point as a complaint necessarily, simply as a notice. If you feel as though it is lacking, remember that there is likely A LOT more to come!",Recommended,13 people found this review helpful 0,0

Charming, cute and fun!

You can tell the developers have put a lot of thought and care into the world, even with its lore, which is surprisingly fun to learn. Lots of customization options and cute animals are available for those who enjoy making outfits, such as myself. The game feels pretty balanced and the developers always seem to deliver when it comes to improvements and updates for the game, I always get really excited for them. I don't ever feel too "" pushed "" to purchase micro-transactions, as they just feel like optional drip, excluding super edition. I've had tons of fun playing by myself and with my friends, so I totally recommend it!",Recommended,27,0

Oh YES! A shooting cute animals game. Better than Fortnite and PUBG cause you don't need to constanlty give your last money to get some cool anime skin.

Well well well... Here we are, where to start?

this is one of the easiest games to pick up and play, with a kid-friendly aesthetic, a bopping soundtrack, and a mostly friendly community. It ditches all the technical fidelity, to make something just fun to play. And with past updates the game is accessible to anyone with a gaming platform, whether that be PC, PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch, anyone can play. it goes back to the roots of traditional battle royales, without extra technical mechanics in it, there's no proning (bc it's a top-down side-scroller perspective), no buying back, no bounties, no hero operators, no special perks, no load-outs, no attachments, no teleporting, it's just simple.

but all good things do come with flaws, or ""happy accidents"" some say the skill gap is quite large, with pro players that know every trick in the book compared to your little brother playing this game. As I've stated before, the game is easy to pick up, but it's hard to master. Some others say the weapons god awful, and I can partially agree (looking at you BCG) but in all seriousness, this is a more focused weapon sandbox, with no overlapping weapons what so ever... ok so maybe the Epic and Legendary overlap over base weapons, but still, each weapon can have a unique role within the sandbox, I won't spoil anything, that's for you to figure out.

The simplistic art style is one to cherish, as every animal is mostly unique and ofc ADORABLE. with every 10 levels, you get more animals, and there are so many to choose from, 369 in fact, and that number is continuing to increase over time. with seasonal updates and new modes and events to keep bringing players back. and with each base animal, you get tons of different and wacky variants of each animal.

The modes, oh boy... well you have your standard Battle Royale modes like solo, duo, and squads, but the event modes throw a monkey wrench into the mix, with a Battlefield type conquest mode with 32 v 32 action, a ""Mystery Mode"" which is standard squads but with a twist, and the most recent addition to the modes roster ""The Bwoking Dead"" it is essentially a horde based PvP mode where survivors try to fend off against a zombie infestation and extract. And the Zombie Chickens, well they will stop at nothing to try and infect all the other survivors. And this is only what we have now, who knows what the future might hold...

In the end, Super Animal Royale is def worth the time, it's free, it's a mostly friendly community, and it's just a blast to play... And no... you're not a furry for playing this.",Recommended,24,1

I'm not usually a fan of Battle Royale games. That said, because of the 2d top-down nature of this game, as well as the cute animals that you play as, I really like this one. It probably helps that I'm able to see other players before they kill me, unlike games such as Fortnite. The recently added Animal Pass and the in-game shop that takes coins earned in-game or tickets bought with real money both seem to give me a lot more incentive to play. There seems to be a lot more players joining in since the new free-to-play update, too!",Recommended,16,0

Step by Step of getting addicted to this game :o

1. Discover SAR
2. Find out you can play it for free
3. Play a game
- 64 players per match/ 40-60 of the slots will be filled with bots as not a lot of players are online at the same time unfortunatly =(
- games currently last 5-10minutes
- queue time is about 1-2 Minutes max
- bots difficulty lvl is absolutly ok and weapons are balanced

4. Be satisfied, not frustrated.
- The devs of SAR are taking the words ""line or sight"" really serious to make the game fair
(if you cant see the enemie, they cant see you either)
- no stupid sniper kills from a km away, this is an eye-to-eye-in-ya-face-shooter

5. Directly decide to buy the game to get all those animal skins and cosmetics unlocked
6. All Achievments as in cosmetics and progress will be kept when switching from free to payed version
7. Cant stap - furr real. HELP

I bought this game during the Easter sale and man, did I not anticipate to have this much fun in a game. Battle royales have always have had the same issues for me- long unrewarding matches (if you lose), toxic communities, and micro transactions to the max. None of these are present here. Matches are short- you don't feel super invested and devastated if you lose. The longer you're alive gives you more DNA for the next animal you want to become. Its addicting in that ""I can get one more game in before I need to sleep"" kind of way. I love it as my fiance can get into the game as she gets motion sick in any game that utilizes a camera. There is skill to be gained in this game- I feel I get better after every night of playing this. My only complaint would be the item drop rates. They released lightsabers- 85 hours in, still no lightsaber. They have a trade up system for items, but it doesn't help when you barely get items playing this game. In hindsight, the low drop rates means that diehards will still get rewards as they play (that I'll eventually become, if I'm not there yet already) Get the founders pack as a donation to the devs- they work hard at bringing constant updates to the game.",Recommended,12 people found this review helpful 0,0

Cute and fun game, if a bit barebones at times.
My biggest problem with it, however, is that the magic of it is lost once you learn that there's basically no players and you'll be fighting 30+ bots every match, which is a darn shame.
Other than that, it's really cheap to buy, you unlock all cosmetics by playing the game, and the demo is basically the full game without said cosmetics.",Recommended,17 people found this review helpful 0,2

Super Animal Royale, Overview and Experience.


I'm not gonna procrastinate on this review any longer.

Super Animal Royale or SAR as I'll call it, is a 2D, MMO, Battle royale Shooter-based game that's more focused on the community rather than a whole lot of content to it. At first glance, SAR may just seem like a children's game, but as the Developers themself admits, this game is aimed toward a more mature and older audience because behind its cute artstyle, it's a deep learning curve to its competitivety which I'll dive into in a moment.

Just to break down one part at a time, SAR has been some of the most amazing and memorable moments of my life, yet some of the most heartbreaking ones as well, I've seen people absolutely disgrace SAR, quit it, and a lot of drama around it, but I've also got to meet some of the most amazing people I've ever met through SAR, people I today have daily contact with.

As I mentioned, SAR completely relies on the community which means everyone you meet, and everyone you get in touch with will all create your experience and journey throughout SAR, and this comes from someone who has played 70% solo games. Without any company, SAR itself is pretty repetitive, same map (yet they do update some locations from time to time), but mainly with the same concept; become the last survivor. Not too much variation to it, but that's pretty typical for a Battle royale game.

Picture this, if everyone used a default skin, with no communication or interaction with others, no one would play SAR. That's the beauty about it, it's the complete opposite. Just cosmetics alone, you get a large library of customizations to personalize your character and identity, with every new set of cosmetics being requested by the community. And a very active centerpiece for SAR is the Chat and communication where you get to meet, talk, and even interact with others. This game is one of the few that has a rule to be ""Pawsetive"" which really brings up the welcoming, supporting, and loving atmosphere!

To highlight a negative aspect about this, the company you make, makes the whole experience, this means that all drama, all broken relationships, and every wrong path with the wrong guy linked to SAR will harshly affect your motivation to even wanna play it at all. But I prioritize forgiveness and moving on, however, this doesn't apply to everyone, which means you may very well stumble up on what you may consider a friend at first but later on backstab you when you least expect it. And that's the risk in laying all faith in the community.


Now, SAR is the best thing I know when it comes to fooling around with friends and just having a great time but when it comes to actual performance, there's a bit of contrast. Outside of SAR we have an unofficial leaderboard website where pretty much everything you do get's tracked on a top 100 players leaderboard in literally everything you can do in SAR, this makes a lot of players grind day and night just to reach the top of a specific or as many as possible leaderboards.

Here's where the competition strikes in, there are some known players that only play to top each other on those inhuman leaderboard numbers. I can tell by experience since I've at one part of my SAR career been grinding stats, it only makes it toxic and at one point I was really close to quitting SAR for good, till I realized how pointless leaderboards actually are, but it doesn't change the fact that some people don't view it that way, tryhards or sweats as we like to call them like to get together to create a literally unbeatable squad where they grind their 100% win streak for hours, which is what makes it so ridiculous for players who just want a casual game but have no chance of winning.

SAR is a game you have to put hundreds if not thousands of hours into to reach the top of your development state, because every gun and playstyle is unique and you can absolutely clear out your opponents if you just know how to place your cards right, you other predict someone's exact movement or doesn't at all, every gun and its playstyle is unique and it all comes down to your preference. So, if a sweat appears, unless you got hundreds of hours of experience, you can just get ready to become someone's prayer. Quote from a well experienced player;

Because of the PTSD SAR has created in me, from meeting the wrong people to becoming the sweat who only strived for getting that sweet top 15 position on the leaderboard. It made me write a negative review about this game which stayed for a long time till I realized how much good it actually has provided me, meeting some of my best friends today from SAR, interacting and taking a win or a loss with just as much joy!

Can't thank you enough SAR, it's been a long journey, with rollercoasters of all sorts but it has made me grow as a person. Yet it sometimes may feel a little repetitive, but it's still a fun game to play. For me, it's more then a silly game, it's a bond in between people, an acceptance and loving atmosphere you can't get anywhere else, it's like a bigger family!

I feel like there's still a lot more to cover but better wire it up than diving into every minor detail.",Recommended,17 people found this review helpful 8,4

Cannot recommend this game enough, even if I started playing it about 2 days ago, it's just so easy to pick up, and have fun in, alone or with friends.

This game is incredibly fast paced that if you die, you can't really get mad. You're done with the match and you can easily hop on to another one! I really love this game, I have also made art for it.

Thank you SAR devs for making such a nice and chill game!! <3",Recommended,15 people found this review helpful 0,0

I promised myself to review this game once I hit 1000+ hours / sorry for any mistake I might have on this-

Super Animal Royale, as other folks in these reviews say, is a 2D animal battle royale game, with hundreds of animal breeds to unlock and unique cosmetics to help you find out what you like to wear yourself or match with another player. Only unique animals/cosmetics that are locked behind paywall is the ones in the starter packs, super edition, and founder’s edition (which the last one is unobtainable and older starter packs are in the vault)

Gameplay wise, for a new player, can either be a hit or miss depending on what lobby you end up in. As the pro players can easily demolish you and bots can be a little messy depending on what they have (hunting rifle bots *shivers* ) continue on to this, this game is not exactly too friendly with new players as the tutorial is quite lacking. Although, finding and figuring out your game strategy and weapons, you can slowly get better at this game. Which inturn can have an addictive game play once you find the rhythm.

Community on this game? It can be difficult to explain but it's like any battle royale community, there’s some cool folks and rather toxic folks, being an ex-streamer and still pretty active in the CC communities around this game. You’ll figure out sooner or later on what folks to avoid and what folks to continue interactions with. As this game community is pretty open and friendly, yet feeling the need to have better “gems”, Season Pass Emotes (which can cost 7 dollars), and more, because it seems like the community isn't too open to Free to Play players or new players unless you have something unique to you, to continue interaction. Toxic parts of this community can be seen easily, yet these types of players do the toxic interactions outside of the game, and instead use discord,youtube,etc. To either harass or do negative stuff like that.
Toxic in game? Mainly just using the laugh emote, repeatedly gem flexing, or anything toxic like that. But again you can just ignore or report any suspicious activity. (plus most of the time these folks are young children)

The issues I have personally with this game is that, once you finish all your milestones and any current pass (which all of this can easily be done under 500 levels or even 350 levels if you are dedicated enough) there’s not much to do, the only things you can look forward to are events and new seasons. Or simply buying an archive pass and work on that, yet if you are a free to play player, this isnt an option for you to do. The only thing you can work for is having new gem colors and getting new breeds of animals, which is fine and I am currently doing this now- Yet the game doesn't reward you anything above 300 levels. Which inturn this game doesn't actually have much “longevity” towards it and this game only seem to update the SAW shop (place where you can spend ingame currency you buy with real money), barely any new updates towards the carl cart shop (in game currency for free players) unless a CC’s item you missed drops in the shop.

Cosmetics are wonderful on this game, These folks even take suggestions from the community and put them on the game (only discord) but my issue with it is that it can have a LONG waiting time to get a old item, as these folks do often put new cosmetics in shop every time a new season drops, yet this push back the rotation which in turn you have to wait a bit long or the increasing feeling of FOMO for the new item, because sometimes you have to wait HALF a year to get a damn item, so do you spend money on it now and not have money for an old item or you just wait AGAIN. On the Carl’s Cart from what I mentioned before doesn't have much dedication for it like the SAW shop.
Yet, I understand why due to them having to rely on cosmetics for monetization, yet it often feels like this said “free to play” game just sometimes kick FTP players to the curve and give them scraps of missed CC items and old event items from 3 years ago (which the last part is a new problem as in the past events ALL players can work for older event items but the new event layout, only gives the recent old items to super edition players)

But from my personal experiences, this game is addictive (as this game is the one I often play recently) and fun to play with friends, and even have new friends made along the way, I just said these negative parts to at least give you the recent taste of what's on this game. As well, I know the developers DO listen to their community and often try to improve. So I wish they listen to this one and take some notes. As I have discussed these problems with my CC friends and new players. This game is INSANELY fun and I am only discussing these with love. But, this is all I can say and thank you for reading-",Recommended,20,0

A super fun game, even better with a bunch of friends. Watch the 'owo's roll in the chat. Seeing as there aren't that much players and matches usually end up being filled with bots, I thought it wasn't very lively, but considering this is Early Access, I think those will increase. Speaking of bots, they're pretty great! The difficulty is just enough to make it hard to distinguish from a real person, because these guys will do their best to hunt them down.
Another worthy mention are the devs. My technical issue was approached by a developer, who did their best to help me, even allowing me to contact them through discord. Even though the issue resolved on its own, it's incredible to see developers so involved with their community. Honestly, almost every discussion has a reply from a dev. They're actually the reason I purchased the game, I believe that they're onto something great here and I'd really like to support their vision.",Recommended,38,0

At first I thought I was going to hate this game, as i'm not into battle royal games. But after a friend got me to play the super free edition, I was surprised at how much fun i had.
The game is simple, and has all the normal battle royal stuff. BUT, it doesn't have building, a battle pass, first/third person view, or combat which lasts more than a minute. Some might consider those as a complaint, but honestly, THANK GOD this game doesn't have those, and it makes the combat last for only a few seconds at a time, and with the map being small, your bound to run into another player/bot. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention this game has bots, tho the're not the best, they still do there job well enough, and can still kill you if you're careless.
The way you unlock cosmetics isn't threw a battle pass, but instead threw DNA for animals you get by playing the game, and you get cosmetics threw the in game achievements, and occasionally a drop per game, or a event in which you can quite easily get the cosmetics from. I love this cosmetics/character system sooo much

now with all that said, I honestly recommend this game. it's so easy to pick up and fun to play

perfect masterpiece of a game. I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest to be playing this game (if not the oldest). Last year I bought my 9 year old son a PC to help in the hard times of losing his mother. I felt as if with work I was not able to bond with my son and I wasn't able to be the father he needed. After awhile of having his PC my son brought this game up to me and I watched him play it for many hours. The games format is simply addictive in the way in which each game is so short that by the end of it you're begging to play another game just to get a win. I decided to buy myself a PC to play this game with my son. This is now the closest I have ever felt to my son and the most accomplished I have ever felt as a father. 75 hours later and this game is still a masterpiece with little to no flaws. God bless this game.",Recommended,24,2

There is nothing I don't like about this game.
The game-play is great.
The visuals are great.
The Level design is great.
The humor is great.
The music and sound effects is great.
The fact it paves new ground and is an overall excellent new entry in a oversaturated battle royale genre where devs often throw together PUBG clones in order to make a quick buck is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heroic.

One of two things are going to happen:

1) The other player or you is going to frantically run away.
2) The other player or you is going to curb stomp the other person.

There really isn't any in between. The fighting is not satisfying. The hamster balls have the jankiest physics and you will either hit someone a mile off or roll someone directly over and do nothing. The emu update was, quite frankly, pointless. The game is fun at first, but I can see why a chunk of their super content creators stopped playing.

Maybe that's a game for you. But it gets dull after having one unsatisfying game after another.




EDIT (April 4th, 2020):

I took a break from the game and tried it again after a while. My original thoughts on the game remain the same, but I want to make it clear:

This is not a bad game. I would not have put so much time into this game if it were not a good game. It really is a good game, and it's very disheartening that these feelings have come up for me. With a clearer head, I've been able to really narrow down the issues that I have with the game.

1) Vehicles. Yeah, the emus got nerfed since the original publishing of this review. Still feels ridiculous to go against them and to have them since you're essentially adding so many hit points to a player for free. But I think both Emus and Hamster Balls do not have a place in Super Animal Royale. You can outrun the skunk gas on foot easily enough. Ball hitboxes are still janky as hell, which I know is because of clientside ping. Still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

2) Time to Kill. This is what makes me the most unsatisfied in the game, I believe. The time to kill (ttk) feels very, very short. Too short, in a lot of cases. Players can melt each other in a flash and there is no saving grace or anything about what just happened. I get that the game is about positioning and mobility. But sometimes I would like to have a longer gunfight with other players. Doesn't have to last over a minute, but when one or the other gets KO'd in less than a second? Doesn't feel fun to me at all, even if I'm the one doing the curb stomping.


Play the game. Enjoy the game. I highly, highly recommend playing the free version to try the game out and see if you like it. If you do enjoy it, buy the game. Heck, get the Founder's Edition - I think Pixile did a good job with this game. These are just the gripes of a sky pirate at this point, anyways.

EDIT (February 15th, 2021)

I can't play the game alone anymore. But I don't want people to shy away from the game. Give it a try, see if you like it. Maybe the game's gotten stale for me after the 600+ hours I've put into it. But I still catch myself getting on the game with friends.

Play it with your friends.",Recommended,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0,1

This game seemed great at first, but i realized that when there's no player, they fill all the empty space with AI.
I was having a blast because i was winning all the time but realized that they were all AI because their names were very simple ones like Frank, Joe... and they all spawn at the same time at the last moment when the server realizes there's no one playing.
It was serious letdown for me so I'm giving a thumb down. Should have other option for filling the AI.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'm not normally into ""Battle Royale"" style games but this top-down 2D spin on the genre has gotten my attention. In the typical Battle Royal fashion, you're one of 64 animals dropped onto an island where the end goal is to kill other the animals (and do the winner dance!) and your reward is 'DNA' to unlock other animal types to play as, different dances, and lots of cosmetic stuff to customize your animal. There's lots to unlock and it's all pretty random and you get access to more DNA drops as you level up also.

At present there's a solo mode, where you go into the match alone against 63 other players and bots, or you can team up with a buddy in Duo mode. There is a squad mode but it's not available until there is a high enough playerbase to support that mode. The devs have also included some pretty nefarious bots to deal with to fill up the matches if there aren't enough players. The game controls very well with a keyboard and mouse and reminds me of stuff like Hotline Miami and Nuclear Throne. Matches are quick, and the challenge of staying alive as the poison gas closes in on the island is thrilling as you run about collecting whatever you can to defeat the competition.

The art style is colorful and the animations are very smooth and the overall polish of the game is amazing. The sound effects are cute and remind me of the old WORMS games I used to play on the Playstation back in 1999, and the soundtrack itself is pretty fantastic. The developers are very active in communicating with the players about working on the game, some even play the game (they have blue names in-game) and I appreciate that a lot, and I can't wait to see what they add over time.",Recommended,15,0

At first I was skeptical, due to the increase of radical B.R games, but after putting around 7 - 8 hours into this, I've fallen in love with it.

- The art-style is adorable, and it offers peaceful visuals mixed with an amazingly punchy and high-toned audio track.
- The game as well isn't pay to win at all, which is heaven on its own in today's world.
- Items in the game are random drops, or they're achievement oriented.
- The community is soft spoken and willing.

I genuinely can never be angry at this game, or the encounters I make in it as well.

* THE GAME AS A WHOLE *

- Offers little to no performance loss.
- Runs VERY well on all machines, and is dynamic.
- Graphics look amazing on low / high settings.
- Little to NO cheaters at all. I've never encountered one.
- Very fast-paced, and simple.
- Matchmaking time is amazing as well, something that a LOT of other B.R games can't offer. It takes around 3 - 4 seconds to find a new match.",Recommended,14 people found this review helpful 0,0

My only con about this is that there isn't enough people playing cause its filled with bots. I don't see why people can't get this game when its so cheap!

Never really played a royale style game, I know of them though and how they work.
This game looks cute though. It's been on my wishlist for a while.

- Boot up game.
- Pick your animal (I went with skull cat, but there's four to choose from, including a bear, fox, tiger).
- As you play you get experience and you get 'genes' to add more research to create more animals and breeds for your list, its all for fun, nothing complicated.

There's dancing too, because of course there is. Conga line.

Right now there's a Christmas event going on, so my cat - who is a calico - has a Christmas elf hat and jumper, and fights with a candy cane.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Honestly I don't know where to start. Typically I despise battle royale games. I've never enjoyed how tryhard-y and unenjoyable they can be and the communities never seem to be any good.

This is different. S.A.R is an absolutely amazing, yet simple game. It's like a parody that somehow outclasses the originals in every way. The gameplay is fun with a low skill floor and fairly high skill ceiling. Even losing match after match, I still find myself coming back, because win or not, the gameplay at it's core is balanced and polished to a degree I've rarely ever seen in games, it's so enjoyable and perfect for such a simple little game.

Not to mention it's charm, the game's artstyle is simple in a great way, everything looks relatively fresh and it's both eye catching and appealing without dragging your attention away from playing the game itself. The map is RIDDLED with little details you can spot mid-game and every one of the animals, whether you like them or not, is adorable.

Now one thing I will mention: If you genuinely hate furries, and have something against them, I wouldn't recommend this. This game draws them in like it's a safe haven, a majority of players you meet will be furs, and they make up a huge part of the community. That being said, this is one of if not the most pleasant, wholesome, genuinely nice and fun communities I have EVER seen in a game. Nobody is toxic, everybody is nice, and everybody is there to have fun.

Finally I'm going to add and say that the devs themselves are great. The game gets updated every few weeks or so with new content always flowing in, they're good, and active, and they care for the community.

TL;DR: It's REALLY damn good, nothing in the game costs money after initial purchase, constant updates, good community, GO BUY. NOW. WILL NOT REGRET. VERY WORTH.

Edit: Now with the super free edition! Seriously there's no reason not to at least give it a try now.",Recommended,8 people found this review helpful 0,0

When a friend showed me this game, I thought to myself ""Top-down Battle Royale? How on earth would that work?"" And to my surprise, the devs made it work out incredibly. The top-down perspective combined with simpler controls (compared to other BR games) make this easily one of the best games of this genre for me.

On top of that, the game has an incredible charm to it, that, even if you die in the stupidest way possible, you sometimes can't help but laugh at the chain reactions that happen subsequently after your death. Of course, this is only something that can happen if you're not one to have their lid blown easily by the slightest puff.

The community is a mixed bag from what I've seen: newbies, sweats and everything in between, but nothing toxic to any extremes, at least in my time of playing.

The events, battle passes (dubbed animal passes) and achievement milestones are rather grindy, but they do reward clothing and weapon skins, which will let you style up your super animal to your liking.

I know saying a battle royale being ""different"" sounds near impossible since they all follow the same blueprint of drop into the map and be the last one(s) standing but SARs makes the game feel painfully casual which is a good thing.

If you want to have that ""Mario Party"" feeling with some friends, buy it! Be sure to have at least one hour (better 2 hours) time for one round.

This game is hella fun and the developers have continued to update the game with new features without charging extra for them. Which is something we lack in the gaming industry these days, to some degree. If you are looking for a silly, multiplayer online or offline game to get drunk with your friends while playing then this is your jam. Trust me, it won't disappoint!

And if the developers read this, you guys are killing it. Keep up the amazing work, I always look forward to your updates.",Recommended,131,5

I know I got like 10 hours on Pummel but I'm a Mario Party Expert

PROS:
- Fun to play with 4+ people
- Teaming up against one another (y'all gonna find out quick who your true friends are)
- Good for the price (I'd wait for the sale honestly)
- Graphics are fun and colorful, it pops out

CONS:
- Mini-games can get old and I swear there's a rotation of them and it's very selected
- Can get boring and repetitive after a certain time period playing the game
- Price is a lil high (even though it's only $15, I think $10 is more reasonable for the game)

CONSIDERATIONS:
- Add a BUY STORE (where you can use your keys you've gained throughout the game) to purchase weapons
- More maps with Killers roaming (Pummeltown is more fun because of the killer, unlike the other maps)
- More mini-games

OVERALL:
- 8/10 game FOR THE SALE PRICE
- It is truly a fun experience with friends and it gets a good laugh outta everyone
- Recommend it to a group of friends who wants to try something else besides playing Rainbow Six Siege, League of Legends, Apex Legends, COD, and Path of Exile every damn day <3",Recommended,119,0

A PC game, with 4-player local co-op (full controller support), that is essentially a more mature version of Mario Party, that largely holds it's own! What's not to like!?! Whole heartedly recommend to anyone who wants party games on the PC.

A couple small Cons:
-Biggest complain is that several games should be longer. Who wants to play a mini-game that lasts less than 30 seconds? Or at least like 5 rounds instead of 1-3. (Mario party also suffers from this.) Or make it an option you can toggle in the menu?
-Controls in some of the games could be better.
-Not all of the games are amazing, but most are fun, if not great. (Mario Party also has some dud games.)

I would would recommend this game, but would like to say that I likely would not play this game further until there are some changes.

Pros:
-The mini-games are extremely fun
-Rewards being good at the mini-games (maybe too much)
-Excellent friendship-ruining simulator

Cons:
-Not enough mini-games!!
-Reward system is kind of broken: first place gets the best items (swap, rocket) at a much higher rate making it extremely punishing
-No point in playing the elements mini-game until the last 5s as only the last crystal matters
-Keys have no use late-game --> needs balanceing, perhaps something to spend them on other than trophies (cannon doesnt count)
-Needs more items, probably more utiliy or no-damage items
-Maps could be bigger

While i do recommend this, changes need to be made to be recommendable beyond several hours. Overall fun, great with friends, and probably the best mario-party-like game out there right now. WOULD BE AMAZINGG WITH UPDATES!

Errors found at time of play:
-In the one 1v3 game, green was always the 1
-With turn order, ties were resolved with who was in the colour order
-->Notes:
-Small sample size
-could not be colour but number (ie. order of joining the lobby)
-experience is mainly with pirate map",Recommended,57,0

This game is a looooooot of fun. I was impressed by the amount of minigames they had when I bought it, and they've added 20(?) more after that. There's 52 minigames right now (updating this when they add new) (EDIT: they've now added workshop support so you can make your own maps and minigames) Rebuilt Games is giving it a lot of love and attention still, and they listen to comments and attend to bugs.
You can play with 4-8 players BUT you can play by yourself and add 3 (or more) bots, no need to have 3 friends to enjoy it. You can even just add bots and watch them play without adding yourself, for some reason. The bots have 3 different difficulty settings. The bots work well and it's satisfying to play with them, although I've noticed them being allowed to cheat in a couple games.
There's a good diversity of maps that work in different ways, and the board-game side of the game is just as fun as the minigames to me. However, you can choose to only play with minigames if you want. (They've updated this now to support customizing your own maps in the workshop).
The minigames are very diverse, and they bring back some nostalgic memories of childhood games. If there's any games you don't really like you can remove them in the settings.
I know there's a local play option, but I haven't tried it yet. Online multiplayer works well, but lag can be a bit of a problem depending on your internet connection.
I really thoroughly enjoy this game, it always gives a good laugh.",Recommended,67,0

Basically a more ""mature"" version of Mario Party. It's refreshing that the order of turns changes every round, depending on the placement in minigames and also a wider variety of items to use, mixing up gameplay. However, even though the minigames are mostly fun to play, it can be repetitive playing mini game after minigame each round, with nothing to spice up the gameplay in general (except for the occasional map changes activated by landing on a specific space). Most of the minigames are a free for all, and I would prefer minigames where there's 2v2 teams and more 3v1 minigames.

It's also nearly impossible to find online lobbies to play, so if you don't have any friends to play this game with, I advise not to purchase. I've only played this game in single player, and I believe that's how I'll mostly play it. The game's price isn't justified with what is offered in single player.

Since the game doesn't have many online lobbies to join, there should be a price cut to bring more traction, thus the possibility of more online lobbies.",Recommended,43,0

I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.",Recommended,138,0

+ Amazing with Friends, Now 8 Players (And you can add AI who you can pretend are your friends)
+ Visually nice, Audio good too.
+ A lot of MiniGames and about 95% of them really good and re-playable.
+ 6 + Different game boards. And all are different with different hazards.
+ Price is fair. A lot of replay value.

It needs updates. It's a good game, but the devs put nothing into it anymore. If they only added a workshop or something with custom maps it would be better. Even better if they other custom things, but I don't have any hope of an update in the future.

UPDATE: I know workshop got added and they've been updating it, haven't really posted an update because I really don't even play many games anymore or have time for them. I am glad that the game isn't totally dead though, it genuinely is good my only problem with it really was repetitiveness. And at the time I posted this the last content update came out over a year ago. I think workshop being added will help keep the game fresh and keep players coming back.",Recommended,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 6,6

It's a Mario Party clone, but has it's own style and is great fun. The variety of boards to play on is great and 90% of the mini-games are great fun.

It does have a few issues and is a little rough in parts. Pretty much every time my friends and I select and customise our characters, the game still switches things around and forgets about custom names. It's a tad frustrating but not game breaking.

Here's to hoping they'll continue adding content. If they do, it'll easily become one of the best things to play whenever you have friends over.

***Updated at the end after playing with some updates, including the option allowing for end game bonus stars***

I skimmed some of the other reviews for the one, major complaint I have. And while it doesn't undo all of Pummel Party's great fun, it seriously hurts its long-term prospective.

Bonus stars.

If you're going to ""copy"" Mario Party's basic formula (and do it quite well, I assure) you are undermining the potential by allowing for too many anticlimactic finishes.
Too often have one of the players been a cup ahead, so to speak, that the final turn (or worse...final FEW) lacks any impact on the game's outcome.

All they need do is add in a customizable bonus star system similar to MP's. Further allow us to turn that feature on/off and everybody wins (for those of you who don't want/care about this aspect).

That one addition alone would make this a 10/10 experience. Add in a few more mini-games and an extra map or mode, and it would rival the King ;)

Lastly, if I'm being greedy, ;) I'd add in some sort of team game element. Either the 3v1 or 2v2 mini-game scenarios that MP does. Maybe the ability to see our mini-game score during the award screen, too (just so I can see how competitive or not I was during said mini-game). But these are not deal-breakers by any stretch.

Bonus stars could be...

***
The bonus star system was handled quite well. Allowing for some customization was a brilliant stroke and wholly appreciated.

I would tweak a couple of other things, but they are minor issues and would only improve quality of gamelife, and all.

Firstly, please add-somewhere on the screen- how many spaces the player has left upon reaching a crossroad. Sadly, I forget oftentimes how many spaces my toon has left to move. Counting those steps is crucial, at times.

Secondly, and far less important, might be, after a mini-game is done and the screen that showcases first through fourth place, leaving the game totals on screen. For instance, in a game that tallies kills, after the mini-game is over and the placing screen comes up, the kill totals are gone, off screen. It might be fun for us to get to discuss how close/dominant a particular score discrepancy is. Maybe not super important, but anything that encourages discussion of what just happened is a good thing in this type of game.

Really have been enjoying this game. I've always been a huge fan of Mario Party games so this game is almost as good but with the ability to play online. Which is the main reason why I keep coming back to this game, even more so over Super Mario Party. The mini games are fun but not that much variety compared to any other MP game. They could definitely use more patterns in some of the mini games as well. After playing them for a while you will naturally learn all of them and it becomes a bit repetitive. The board play aspect of the game is probably my favorite part about the game. There are only 4 boards as of now and they're all really fun to play but I would like to see them add more boards in the future. I really like the ability to combat with your opponents by collecting all the items and using them against others. Overall this game is a lot of fun to play has a lot of potential to be the better party game over MP but only if they keep adding content to the game.",Recommended,30,0

I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.",Recommended,206,0

Pummel Party is a multiplayer game with similarities to Mario Party. Like Mario Party, you roll the dice to move across the board, play mini-games, and try to collect the most stars to win. The game can be played with friends, random people online, or AI. There are different mini-games where you shoot each other, knock each other off cliffs, and many other activities.

It's all in good fun, but the biggest difference between Pummel Party and Mario Party is the level of violence. Pummel Party has blood, guts, and carnage, making it more suitable for adults. The graphics are reasonable, and there are plenty of customization options. The game is straightforward and doesn't require a complicated rulebook. It's a party game, and it's best played with friends who are willing to get hammered online for several hours. During hosting or joining games, I never experienced any disconnects or crashes. It's a fun solid title.",Recommended,23 people found this review helpful 3,1

This game when i first saw it Fusion Frenzy came to mind. Now its obviously not that same, it is different from Fusion and other party/minigame options out there with the boardgame mode. The way the boardgame mode is done is so fun and semmingly well thought out. You have your main objective to win which is to obatin as many trophies as possible before you run out of turns. Turns work in rounds, at the start you roll to see who goes first then after everyone has had their turn you play a minigame. Depending on how you place in the random minigame you get that dictate when you will go on the boardgame. (if you get 1st place in the minigame you get to go first etc..).

My only issues is i just wish there was more than 4 players",Recommended,33,0

It's Mario Party for the PC. I could go more in-depth about the minigames and stuff but that's honestly all you need to know.

I'm glad that the devs chose not to abandon the game and instead expanded on it. New minigames, new maps, and especially mod support for custom minigames push its replayability by a lot. It's really telling that me and my friends came back to this game almost 2 years later and had just as much fun as our pandemic sessions.

My main gripe with the game is how it handles disconnects, or rather how it DOESN'T handle disconnects. When you or your friend disconnects, that's it. They can't reconnect. It sucks, and is a problem since the game's launch that they still haven't addressed.",Recommended,20 people found this review helpful 1,0

This game saved my life.

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The board game is in itself quite fun, but the true magic lies in the minigames, of which there is plenty! If you have a group of friends to play this with, you'll have a great time, with lots of laughter and merryment.
One of the really great things about this game, is that it truly feels like a boardgame, meaning you have lots of relaxing downtime inbetween the minigames, where you can conversate, eat and drink etc. leading to a very balanced experience you won't get tired of quickly!

Pummel Party is a great game where you can have fun with both AI bots and your friends (highly recommended). To put it briefly, it is a board game in which you progress by rolling dice on several different maps and decide who will roll the dice first in each hand, in the minigame you play at the end of the previous hand.

Let me explain a little more:

+ You decide with the dice who will start the first hand. (numbers on the dice: 1-9)
+ The aim of the game is to win as many trophies as the target when setting up the room.
+ You must collect 40 keys for each trophy and go to a specific chest on the map to get it. If you don't have enough keys, you can't open the chest.
+ Each character has 30 health. They created this so that you can eliminate your competitors. If you die, you are reborn at the re-spawn point. (There are also separate items on the board, I talk about them below)
+ A random minigame opens after each hand is finished.
Minigame: These are small games that are logically derived from arcade and PC games such as bomberman, quidditch, fps, tanks, etc. and are very fun and end quickly.
+ When you return to the board game you are playing, in addition to beating your opponents with dice, there are items you can use if you are within sufficient range. (e.g. you can inflict 30hp damage to your opponent with boxing gloves, or you can use a portal to replace yourself and another opponent, and there is even a HP box as an item that you can use when your health is low)
But lastly, you can fight with some of your friends after this game. haha",Recommended,38 people found this review helpful 0,17

similar to Mario Party but with elements of violence and death. many minigames are included and other elements to make the game enjoyable and competitive with friends

the game works with both remote play and online play; however. i definitely recommend playing online over remote though because remote seems to have some latency but nothing too bad to where it makes it unplayable.

Pummel Party is a Mario Party-type party game. It is one of those games that you see Youtubers playing for a bit and then fading out of existence. That is the sad fate of a wide variety of party games if they even get the chance to have their short time in the Youtube spotlight. Despite this game actually being really good, it, unfortunately, fell to this all-too-common fate.

The overall experience of playing this game is incredibly enjoyable, thanks to its well-crafted gameplay, charming art style, and surprisingly good music. When it comes to gameplay, the game excels in all areas, from its well-designed minigames to its diverse boards and engaging items. Compared to the ever-popular Mario Party series, this game stands out as a more fun and polished experience.

One of the highlights of the game is the minigames, which are not only numerous but also expertly crafted. They are varied enough to keep things interesting, and they provide a nice balance of challenge and fun. The boards are also well thought out, offering different gameplay mechanics and obstacles that require players to use different strategies to win. The items outside of the minigames add an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, allowing players to gain advantages over their opponents or affect the game in different ways.

Moving on to the music, it is a pleasant surprise that adds to the overall experience. While it may not be something that players would listen to outside of the game, it does a fantastic job of setting the mood and creating an immersive atmosphere. It complements the gameplay well and helps to immerse players in the world of the game.

The art style is simple yet effective, and it perfectly suits the kind of game it is. The art style does not distract from the gameplay but rather enhances it by allowing players to focus on the gameplay mechanics and the objectives. It's a great stylistic choice that contributes to the overall charm and appeal of the game.

Overall, this is a good variation of a Mario Party-type party game. It does many things better than normal Mario Party but fails in having proper recognition and traction. I would recommend this game, but only if you have a group of friends to play it with. If you don't have a group of friends to play this with, then there are probably better options out there for you.",Recommended,20,1

This is a surprisingly fleshed out party game with many different methods of winning. With it's obscure and open-minded approach to party games, even with the minigame elements, Pummel Party excels in making sure every player involved has a chance to get one over on their friends (enemies). With that out of the way, in the same vain that Mario Kart or Smash Bros. may make you lose your friends, this will do the same. This will most likely come from your enemies (there are no friends anymore) abusing their RNG and make the game a living hell for you. Be advised. Either way, fun time. 7/10",Recommended,27,0

Great game for all ages from 6 years.

story:

This game is fun and ruins friendships.

It needs much more minigames to be fun for longer time and the controls need to be improved for some of them. Especially the First Person Games have hellish controls.
The light saber game is just horrible, doesn't feel like you have any control over whats happening.

am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Pummel Party is an evolution of the Mario Party formula. Finally the turn order isn't decided right at the start but after every minigame which makes the minigames even more important. As a player you can customise a lot of the settings like which items are allowed, which minigames can be selected, which special trophies should be distributed and many more.
With this customisation, Pummel Party can be the adult version but can be family friendly as well if you turn off blood effects and maybe some minigames.
The AI can be really good in some minigames but in others they are slightly overpowered. But at least you can select the difficulty level of them as well.
By adding health to the players, it can get really intense and fun, because your friends can hurt you with their items and kill you which ends in losing a lot of your keys and respawning on some dedicated points on the map.
The maps also have a great variety with a Christmas, Halloween, pirate, desert, space and forest-temple setting. Each map has special features like a killer hunting for pray at the end of the round or changing direction if a player activates a certain type of space.
These features make the maps feel unique in their own way.

But the most important aspect of this game is the new implemented mod editor. You need to keep in mind that the editor is still in beta, so some bugs can appear in mods and not every feature mentioned above is possible right now. But I have spend a lot of time in the editor and I have to say it makes so much fun creating your own maps and minigames. The editor is also really intuitive and you don't need to learn a lot to use it efficiently. Furthermore a nice community has evolved around the editor. After just seven months, in total the workshop has already 450 minigames and 402 maps for you to explore (of course some of them are not so great, but there are many maps and minigames that have gotten a lot of effort by the creators and you can find hidden gems in the workshop) and of course some Mario Party contend has already been created.
And despite the developers being a bit quiet with the community (I hope that will change soon), I am convinced that the editor will keep the game alive for a long time. So please support mod editors that are creating great contend for all of you for free.

That was a brief list of aspects why I think that Pummel Party is the best Mario Party game out there and I would definitely recommend you buying it and enjoying the rage of your friends when you kill them with an eggplant.",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 0,0

One of the best Co-op Puzzle games ever to be created (It's up there with Portal 2), true Co-op in which you HAVE to play cooperatively with another person in order to move forward in the puzzle, and alot of time you both will need to be in sync too.
The puzzles are challenging and very creative (again, up there with portal 2) and it's a great fun figuring the solution with a friend (especially if you two are on voice chat).
The music and Art design are both very good too, the only minor problem i had with this game is that the camera can be abit clunky at times.

Ibb & Obb offers an AMAZING art style I have never seen in any other game. The puzzle design is brilliant and difficult if you play it by yourself. (I recommend playing it in co-op mode, it will be easier than you think), It reminds me to Thomas Was Alone with a crazy gravity system (similar to Portal).
The soundtrack is enjoyable, relaxing, soft and makes me want to buy the OST.
The gameplay is a little confusing once you start playing, but you'll handle it later. Going back to the puzzles: although the puzzles are brilliant, once you have reached the fourth level, it will give you an instantly headache.

The good:

◘ Relaxing, and quiet soundtrack.

◘ Amazing art style

◘ Great puzzles

◘ Good gameplay quality (I recommend you to play it with a controller)

◘ Amazing PC port

I absolutely love ibb & obb so I just wanted to write a short review for those who are interested in getting this fantastic game! ♥

PROS
Genuinely amazing and challenging puzzle platformer (IMO: Difficulty spiked about halfway through the game.)
Visually stunning with its cutesy art (How can anyone resist the cuteness of ibb & obb! And the beautiful scenery! It just makes me want to take a screenshot every few seconds.)
Soundtrack is very soothing and relaxing, fits the game's theme perfectly!
Easy controls - all you can do is jump, run, walk, and draw!

CONS
Continuous lag during online co-op, particularly when I played the last level; the final boss glitched badly for my partner and I, which made the game a little bit frustrating but still fun
No clear storyline and narrative; players simply choose between playing the smaller green ibb or the taller pink obb and get to the end of each level by solving puzzles!

This game is a delight. It's simple and challenging in just the right amounts. Most of the puzzles stumped us when we first encountered them, but only for a few moments - never long enough to feel frustrating. It's a cycle of 'Whee! Wha...? Aha! Whee!'

This isn't something I would normally praise but I also appreciate the lack of a backstory or anything like that. You just drop in and go. It gives the game an admirable clarify of focus: ibb, obb and things that make ibb & obb pop. What more do you need?

Review by Games for Lovers - only GOOD local co-op games!

You want to play something with your significant other?

This cute side-scrolling jump'n run will have you solving gravity-based puzzles while enjoying the brightly colored world. You and your SO play as the titular ibb and obb, two little creatures trying to reach the level exit together.

With wide-eyed characters and rounded edges, this game is extremely sweet to look at, while the challenges are managable.

ibb & obb has been designed to be played in 2-player co-op, local or online. You can only succeed by working closely together. Playing alone is not possible. Works fine with XBox 360 gamepads.

TLDR: Great coop puzzle platformer, totally recommended.


POSITIVE
- It's very easy to get into, and fun to play.
- Great minimalistic artstyle, smooth controls and platforming. Good music.
- Puzzles are clever and needs team work.
- It really needs cooperative work, so will help to improve team communication.
- You dont need any controller to play, a keyboard is just enough for both players.
- Online coop just works fine just as local coop, so you wont face connection problem when playing with friend through internet.
- You can still play it alone but it'll be so hard without friend (so i recommend to get one lol)

NEGATIVE
-None

It's one of the best coop games I've ever seen and totally recommend to pick this up. Full price might be too much, but you can buy it on sale.



Suggestion for devs: It would be a great if you guys add a mini extra football mode to just play it casual. I loved kicking those little creatures, it could be a great extra soccer minigame. (maybe a DLC?)",Recommended,33,0

Okay, so im going to preface this review with the fact that I think ibb & obb is a well made game and the dev team deserves your money. That being said holy moley screw this game back to hell. I have never, EVER played a more frustraiting platformer in my life.

It starts off nice and easy, chillax almost, but about 2/3rds the way through the game the dificulty curve becomes a sheer cliff of ""go screw yourselves kiddos"" and on top of it your playing this CO-OP. Let me tell you a fun fact that will save you some frustration early on. IF YOU DIE, YOU BOTH DIE. So you get some puzzles that will litterally take you half an hour of throwing yourselves at the thing until it works to get, and then one of you (you or your friend) will just die and have to start over because this game is so oddly frustratingly hard. I litterally can't tell you how mad me and the bud I played through wthis with got. Normally me and him are the chillest buds and best of friends, but man did we both jsut wanna get up, drive to eachothers house, and put the other one in physical pain while screaming at them in pure rage.

Only buy this for you and you friend if you want to end the friendship.

I played Ibb & Obb with my partner and we enjoyed the platforming, puzzles, music, and art most of the time. And the victory dancing at the end of each level was very cute.

The second half of the game introduces some tricky puzzles which I didn't mind solving, but there was some difficult platforming that required accurate timing from both partners which led to some frustrating moments.

I'm lucky to have a great partner to help me overcome the difficult end levels and be part of the 10% of players that beat the game <3",Recommended,16 people found this review helpful 1,4

Really fun with a friend.
At first it starts with great friendship
After your friend makes a few timing mistakes, you laugh together
After repeating the same error on the same puzzle, and he apologizes, you just want to yell at him
But how worth it is when you end the game and you decide to delete your friend contact for ever for the little d33psh!t he is for playing like that

Me and my son traditionally play a coop puzzler on New Year's Eve and this time it was ibb & obb.
Even though we had some screens that we had to rack our brains (for at most 15 minutes) we managed to finish it in about 4 hours which is just the right length for us.
That of course doesn't include any extras.

We felt challenged to the right degree and well entertained.
The art style was appealing and the sound design very atmospheric.
The controls were straightforward and felt responsive.

The only technical issue we had was heavy stuttering when playing with vsync enabled on a TV screen via HDMI.
We solved it by force disabling vsync for the game in the AMD Radeon Software.

Since two player coop puzzlers are rather scarce I'm thankful for every good contribution to the genre and ibb & obb is definitely one!",Recommended,16 people found this review helpful 0,0

My Experience

I actually started playing ibb & obb with a friend like six months ago. We immediately found the visual design to be charming and the gameplay design to be clever.

However, and perhaps this is just me, I find puzzle games like this to be exhausting. In your more traditional AAA action/adventure games, you'll have an action segment, then a puzzle segment, then an action segment, etc. In ibb & obb, it's just puzzle after puzzle after puzzle. So, instead of the game itself managing the pacing, you'll need to manage it yourself. For me, this meant only playing ibb & obb in 30 minute to 1 hour increments. In addition, it could be one of the reasons that my co-op partner and I would put the game down for weeks at a time.

Additionally, please note that there is quite a bit of platforming in ibb & obb. It is much more of a puzzle-platformer than a pure puzzle game. There were multiple sections that required precise timing and movement to navigate, and these were difficult even after you figured out what you were supposed to do. The execution itself could be a roadblock.

Although ibb & obb seems to be a well-designed puzzle game, I can't claim to have really enjoyed my time with it that much. I'll give it a recommendation though, because it could be that I just don't like the puzzle game genre very much.",Recommended,16,0

Ibb & Obb * 7/10

No story. No settings. Just Puzzles. End of Review.

No, seriously, how can a game like this be so nice? Really, there's no story because it wouldn't change that much, the setting is irrelevant it's more about the art itself. The only thing that matters in this game is cooperative work, and that's because this game is Cooperative only, either local or via servers.

So, this is a sidescroll platform and you have to play with a friend as Ibb & Obb. All you have to do is run the two fellas along the world. A world split in half by the ground and you can switch side through occasional portals in order to get past dangers or obstacles. Obviously the other side has an inverted gravity and this is just one of the many little things that you will notice along your runs with your friend as there will be many more obstacles and situations that will require cooperation and teamwork, tight syncronization and creative solution as the more you'll progress through the levels, the more complicated and elaborated the situations will be.

The artistic aspect of the game is so minimalistic, but colorful and polished, kind of childish but it's not that kind of dumb childish. It's something relaxing and maybe a bit nostalgic. The music isn't anything outstanding but it's a very nice and light musical accompaniment that will encourage that relax sensation you have while playing this game.

I must admit that I kind of get angry when I get stuck with games both for difficulty or unsolvable puzzles, but with Ibb & Obb it just doesn't happen. I stand and wait, I try to figure a solution, a workaround, I discuss with my friend a possible way to pass through and if we just can't figure it out we'll just end our session to resume the next days (with success).",Recommended,13 people found this review helpful 0,0

So I played this for awhile with a friend that bought it for me. It made us feel like idiots, but we had fun. Well, I had fun, my friend got frustrated and ragequit.
Some choice quotes from our play session:

Friend: I'm too tired to do physics puzzles...
Me: Science is super hard, dood. That's why I does arts and voice stuffs.

Me: This reminds me of Antichamber, in the sense that I feel like I'm super smart for breezing through like 20% of the game then I get stuck and I'm like ""my brain is a soy nut"".

Friend: HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!
*3 seconds later, I figure it out and do it no problem*
Me: ...
Friend: Shut up. Just shut up.
Me: I said nothing.
Friend: I can hear your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ smugness through the microphone.

Friend: Wait, hold up, we have to go back for the floating crystal meth.
Me: Kay.
*Camera won't let us go back*
Friend: ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SERIOUS
Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAHAHA
Friend: gggrrrrrRRRRRRRRR
Me: Well, ♥♥♥♥ us, I guess.

Friend: Hey, what's that?
Me: I think it's a thing.
Friend: No ♥♥♥♥. Let's touch it's butt.
*We reach it, it's a portal to a hidden stage*
Me: Oooh, bonus level!
Friend: Awesome, let's do this.
Me: Mmk, it doesn't look too hard.
*30 minutes of failure later*
Me: I think we both need to get checked for brain damage.
Friend: THIS IS THE MOST CANCER

Friend: Oh, I guess we can get out, there's another portal down here.
Me: Yeah, I guess that's the ""I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up, I thought I was smart enough to do the bonus stage but I'm actually really dumb, please save me"" button.

Friend: I can't handle this right now. I need to go play something brainless. Like League.


My co-op experience was excellent; I laughed so hard that I had a coughing fit and got a nosebleed.
10/10 would ruin a new sweater by bleeding on it again.

EDIT: I should probably mention that for maximum co-op enjoyment, you and/or whoever you play it with should be drunk and/or exhausted, the two of you should be voice chatting via teamspeak or discord or whatever you prefer to use and one of you should record or stream it if possible so that your other friends can enjoy your failure and success (but mostly failure).",Recommended,43,0

This game does have a single player feature which requires you to simutaneously control Ibb and Obb. This is very challenging and it can be frustrating at times.

Starts out very interesting and follows a good principle: simple enough that they players always know that they have all the tools they need to solve a puzzle. They also use very frequent mini check points, so you don't have to start a whole level over.
...
But then it digresses into really tricky timing platforming with multiple challenging tasks in timed sequenses and the fun sort of drains off to exaspiration. Put another way, when you know how to solve a puzzle but they needlessly have easy to fail tight timing/positioning things that all have to be done as one continuous chain where either person can fail, and have to do it all over again. I think I'd rather play something else at that point.

If you really really love tricky platforming (both pricision/timing and intelectualy challenging), you may really like this game. I liked if for a short while and then hit a point where it felt like a chore and I didn't want to pick it up again.",Not Recommended,130,5

I don't write serious reviews often, but I just want to talk about how disappointed I was by this game. The first half of it was amazing. The co-op puzzles were very fun and satisfying to solve, and it had brilliant level design that gradually introduced the nuances of each gimmick. But in the second half, the puzzle aspects get dialed down in favor of platforming challenges, where the co-op aspect often feels like an afterthought. My friend and I often got stuck in later levels, not because we were stumped by a puzzle, but because dodging an enemy required stupidly precise movement (magnified by the fact that if one player dies, the other instantly dies too) and gravity bubble segments where you both have to complete it at the same time if you don't want to fight against the camera. Once the game introduced a darkness gimmick we just gave up and decided it wasn't worth completing. This game could've been amazing, but instead it was just saddening. But at the end of the day, that first half was a fun time, and I recommend it just for that, but I sincerely wish the rest of the game maintained that same design.",Recommended,12 people found this review helpful 0,0

A harmless looking, cute little platformer with relaxing music and some neat co-op mechanics like jumping on each others heads to reach higher places, killing upside down enemies so your friend can collect their gems, or pushing each other into angry shadow hedgehogs for the heck of it. Repeatedly. Even though that kills both of you.

When I say harmless looking, what I mean is, don't let the adorable little blobs deceive you. This game is actually evil. It's stressful, can be hectic, sometimes requires precise (co-operative) timing, will kill you over and over and over, and it might make you feel exceptionally dumb at times.

It took us about 7 hours to complete in co-op. Apparently, there is a speedrun somewhere out there which takes about half an hour and which I refuse to watch because my self-esteem can only take so many gut punches.
(To be fair, those 7 hours also include several cases of murder, some manslaughter, and quite a few occasions of ""giving up and looking up a walkthrough"".)

The graphics are very nice; somewhat simplistic, colourful yet easy on the eyes, and even aforementioned shadow hedgehogs (who are out to kill you) are oddly adorable.
Some might find the music a little too relaxing, it can create a very false sense of security, but I personally liked it a lot.

The gameplay isn't exactly special, it's a platformer. Sometimes it's a bit hard to land on a narrow platforms, especially in cases when you have to be quick about it, but overall I think it's alright. Occasionally you have to run from things that follow you, without being exactly sure what comes next, so a bit of trial & error is definitely involved, though as long as you're in the game, checkpoints are fairly frequent.
There are no save points within levels (or stages). You have to complete them before it's reasonable to throw your controller out the window in utter frustration; but technically, the levels are short enough to make that okay when you don't spend too much time staring at a puzzle in dumbfounded silence.

There are secret levels and hard to reach bonus gems in each stage which I can only assume are even more complicated to reach than the ways forward. We might have found one of those secrets way back at the start of the game, but if we did, it was an accident, and I'm not sure it ever happened in the first place. It's nice that this is a thing, though.

I very much recommend this game if you have someone to play co-op with and aren't likely to disown your friend just because they've thrown you into a shadow hedgehog one too many times. While it's possible to play it alone, you'd have to be utterly mad and maybe possessed by several demons to do that.",Recommended,14,5

Positive:
- Simplistic yet beautiful art style
- Nice calming music
- Simple, functional game mechanics
- Gradual learning curve
- Difficult challenges
- Very fun and fair
- Replay value (improve your score)

Negative:
- You need another player

Conclusion:
Ibb & Obb is a fantastic puzzle-platformer. It's mechanics and physics are simple enough but the game gradually becomes more complex such that you have to combine these simple mechanics to solve the later puzzles. While difficult, it is very fulfilling to finally solve them.
I haven't tried playing this game with strangers online, but I can imagine it can be frustrating if you can't communicate properly (there is an in-game function to communicate with your partner but a voice chat would probably be more useful). Thus I would only recommend getting this game if you have a reliable friend to play it through with you. Still an excellent game though.",Recommended,10,0

I have never wrote a review before but this game is so cute I had to. I bought this in a sale but I would say it's worth the full price as you will have so much fun with it!

This is a lovely and fun game to play with a friend or a loved one as it is a fantastic puzzle solver. You will enjoy playing it even more if you use a microphone in multiplayer so you can communicate and help each other to complete the levels.
It took me and my friend 20 hours to complete it and to do all of the achievements. The 'Quality Time' achievement was a lot of fun to do and took a couple of hours to achieve. Both of us enjoyed playing this and had a lot of fun dying throughout due to the varied difficulty. The levels start off simple and as you progress the later ones become frustrating and a little troublesome, but if you keep trying you will eventually finish the game. We both became stuck on some puzzles for awhile but we found the solution by trying many different ways.
It is quite interesting and difficult to find all the hidden crystals and obtaining the highest possible score on all levels, but there are guides that can help you with that.
In the game you can move your mouse and some paint follows which I thought was an excellent way to show the person you're playing with if you had an idea. Also, when you finish a level ibb & obb do a dance which I found adorable.
The whole of the game is bright and colourful, and is worth playing to the end so you can see the final cutscene.
After completing the game I decided to craft the badge. The emoticons turned out to be pleasant to use and the backgrounds are cute due to the little characters on them. I will be using these often as they are my favourites.
The only negative I'd have to say is that the last few levels were really difficult for me and I made my friend do most of the bits because I couldn't, I probably would have if I practiced over and over. This game involves teamwork if you're playing on multiplayer and patience to finish it. Oh, and another thing, I wish there were more levels!

I love this game. Bought the double pack for me and my fiance at Christmas and we just started playing it. We love it, logging 3.5 hours so far with only two sessions (the first was cut short due to Steam updates, but we couldn't wait to play more!).

This is an adorable co-op game (co-op required, unless you're skilled enough to run both players yourself in local co-op) with fun challenging puzzles. The annimations are really cute and the level design is excellent. Every obsticle requires work from both players working together (not idle for carrying). The preferred method of play would be with some one you can talk to either over voice chat or in the same room, communication and teamwork are key.

I first played this game on Ps4 with my Mom. We enjoyed just getting through it together and me being the achievement hunter I am sometimes made her replay levels with me over and over again until we got perfect scores. The computer version isn't any different I feel, and after my Mom passed I had to recruit a new achievement hunting buddy. Which was my husband until he got fed up with the same levels over and over XD. Instead I recruited a friend who is equally an achievement hunter. The puzzles aren't too difficult I'd say, but if you're trying to achievement hunt or not play levels over and over 20 times, you really need to be in sync with your partner. I tried playing this game solo a few times and never got any joy out of that. The little dancing guys at the end of each level really made me feel good. The better your score the better they dance. You have to stop and let Ibb and Obb groove out a little in reward for a hard fought level completion! I recommend this game to people who want to test their friendships and spouses with how well you can work as a team. It will either run like a well oiled machine or it will be complete chaos, but I loved practically every minute of this game despite how frustrating some of those levels could be.",Recommended,9 people found this review helpful 3,0

A fun game at the start but about halfway through it stops being a puzzle platformer and becomes far more focused on timing based jumps and less about actually solving anything.

Highly recommended if you've got a partner or a best friend that likes games, it's a joyful little experience. Even when you get hopelessly stuck. Then you can just laugh together about how dumb you are and come back and try again later.",Recommended,7 people found this review helpful 0,0

Marketing ibb & obb as an exclusively co-op game was a huge mistake,
because it is very possible to play, enjoy, and beat the game as a single player, using the keyboard to control both characters. The result is a really interesting and difficult puzzle-platformer, well worth the price if you're looking for a challenge.

It's also possible -- though very challenging (and very rewarding) -- to 100% the game as a single player controlling both characters. I wouldn't put it in quite the same box as other ""tough-as-nails"" platformers like Super Meat Boy, since it has puzzly mechanics that are quite different and unique. But that's really part of it's charm.

It's by no means a ""casual"" experience to play it as a single player. But if you dig stuff like SMB, you really should give it a go.",Recommended,8,0

I have a hard time reviewing games tbh. This game, however, is a part of a whimsical challenge attributed to the integrity of the friendship with the person you chooce to play it with. I have decided to play with a person I trust in the game world and not just a random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that wants to tell me what to do. These challenges, with your friend, are overcome through communcation with a mouse-trail of bubbles (or microphone lol) follow by lots of facedesk slamming, frustration, screen cracking, mouse breaking and blood-curdling, nightmarish bouts of war with the developers indirect laughs in your face. It is a brutal level design for each of the areas and even the smartest people lack common sense, I took a while to write this review because, this friend I chose, we both need breaks and a mutual time to participate in this game. It is well worth it and not only does it build onto the integrity of your friendship, but it creates hatred for self; the realization that one is not always the brightest and when you do finally realize something, how hard it is to communicate it.",Recommended,16,0

One of the most enjoyable co-op experiences I've had. Great puzzles, beautiful art style, cute characters, good music. Get a whole lot of mileage out of a handful of simple gameplay mechanics. You'll find yourself screaming in frustration, shouting and pumping your fist in triumph, erupting in cathartic laughter as it finally seems you and your friend will accomplish the intricate, difficult procedure you've spent so long figuring out and attempting, only to see your friend make a stupid mistake and ruin everything at the last second.

The game only lets you communicate with your online parter by drawing blobby, imprecise lines onscreen. This could be seen as a drawback, but in fact it becomes its own meta-puzzle: how do I explain this detailed series of actions that will involve precise timing, without using any words? You come to develop a rudimentary syntax; you start saying yes and no by moving back and forth and jumping up and down, respectively, or you draw frantic scribbles on the screen to indicate frustration. It's so much more satisfying to solve puzzles this way; you really feel like you've accomplished something beyond the game itself. Of course there are also those infuriating moments when you give up trying to use the in-game language and resort to Steam chat, or even make a phone call and talk through it in real time. And then there are transcendent moments when you and your partner both know exactly what to do without attempting any communication at all.

It's also great fun to be a jerk and push your partner over cliffs or into enemies.

If I have only one criticism it's that if you're playing with more than one friend (say, one online and one IRL) there's no reliable way to keep track of which levels you've finished with each friend. Like, I beat the game with friend A while I was only a few levels in with friend B, and then I'd start up the game with friend B and some of the puzzles would start to seem mighty familiar, and I couldn't be sure if it was only because I'd already played them with friend A, or because I'd also already played them with friend B. You can reset ALL of your progress, which would have made it easier to kow where I was with friend B if I'd started with them AFTER beating the game with friend A, but I had two games going at the same time so deleting my progress with friend A would have deleted the friend B's progress as well, and it wouldn't have been fair to friend A, either, if we ever decided we wanted to go back and try to get all the crystals on certain levels without replaying all the others. The option for separate play ""sessions"" could have solved this (I always thought having three save slots in the Zelda games was overkill, but now I see the reasoning behind it). But, lengthy complaint notwithstanding, this is really a minor problem.

I was lucky enough to get this in a double pack as part of a bundle, but It's definitely worth the full price.",Recommended,10,0

I have to really recommend this game, specially for those who enjoy retro games. Ibb and Obb is a cooperative game which I started playing with a friend online. Almost at the end of the game, there was some lag that made me finish the game by myself. However this game brought me so much fun and challenges due to its entertaining yet quite difficult levels. My only complain about this game is that it should have being longer, having more levels to play, as it was quite short.

Two friends out for a stroll.

Story:

There's not really a story in ibb & obb. The basic gist is that you're traversing through the environment to reach a party that's being thrown by your friends, but that's really all I can muster and I could be wrong. It's not really a story driven game and therefore not much to talk about here.

Graphics:

Visually ibb & obb is a delight to look at. The art style is described as a bunch of abstract shapes getting eyes slapped onto them and a very nice color palette. Honestly that's one of the most striking things about the game, is the colors. They have some very nice shading and it really pops during the night moments of the game with some genuinely great lighting.

Level from level usually looks pretty similar with very minor changes to the background. You'll mostly be encountering the same type of enemies, characters and similar backgrounds. The latter of which has some big changes, like a few different gimmicks that I won't mention here, but I wish there were more interesting environments.

Audio:

Both visually and from the audio perspective of the game, it's a very mellow game. Even in the more ""action"" packed moments of the game the soundtrack never really goes crazy. It's actually very nice to listen to and doesn't become grading, cause there will be moments where you will have to stop and think through a puzzle.

There's not much other sound effects to speak of. Killing enemies, squishing balls and other things make minor noises which some of them are pretty funny once you get playing, that's really all you'll be hearing. It's design is on point considering they're very soft and satisfying to listen to.

Gameplay:

ibb & obb is a puzzle platformer where the main focus is teamwork. The game is co-op only so you'll need to get a friend to tag along with you on this journey. The whole gist is that there's a lot of moments where you will need to help each other reach platforms and clear a pathway that the other player can cross.

ibb is a short and can't clear certain jumps so you need to use obb as a moving platform to get yourself up to platforms neither of you can reach. There's also gravity inverting pools split across the floor and the whole gist is that you need to build up momentum to clear them. That's what the puzzle boil down to, find a way to build enough momentum to clear a gap.

The puzzle design is genuinely difficult at times and had me and my co-op partner stumped because certain moments seem so tight on time that it requires borderline perfection to clear and it had us wondering if we're missing something. You can also die, but the game is generous enough with checkpoints that it's not that big of a problem.

The controls themselves are pretty simple and work really well. There's not much to mess up here as all you can really do is walk left and right and jump, so it works pretty well and although there is sometimes really tight jumps that are janky to make, it works fine for the majority.

However there is some big issues with the game. One of them is the online co-op of the game being incredibly broken. There are moments where the game will break and will lock one character in place and not let him move which will force you to restart the entire level from the beginning and certain levels are long. One of the hardest levels nearing the end of the game has a moment where you can quickly die multiple times at the end of the level and lock the game and end up having to go through all of it.

Verdict:

ibb & obb is a really fun co-op platformer that's both cute in it's design and surprisingly challenging once you get to the puzzles. I had a blast with my time and although there were some infuriating moments, it's still an experience worth going through with a friend.

Final Rating:
7.5/10

Pros:
+ Adorable art style
+ Soundtrack is easy on the ears so it doesn't get grading when you're stuck on puzzles
+ Some genuinely great puzzle design

Cons:
- Online CO-OP is pretty buggy
- Certain levels have incredibly tight windows for performing jumps

A great puzzle platformer dedicated around the momentum of gravity that you can experience with a dear friend, a significant other or in worst case, a random stranger from a place unknown. Do not try this alone.. The interesting combination of clever physics, precision jumping all clad in a quirky world that looks like something out of a psychonauts playbook makes this the perfect place to spend a few hours in while escaping the futile drudgery of meatspace..

I was looking for a good co op game to play with my girlfriend. She's an inexperienced gamer, but really wanted to find something we could enjoy together and this game fit the bill perfectly.

ibb & obb is the definitive co op platformer! The style is soft, colorful, and simple, yet beautiful.

The controls are simple run and jump and the gimmicks of bouncy floors, reversed gravity, spikes, etc. are familiar and easy enough to figure out, but used in a brilliant combination of ways.

Plus the enemies are defeated by one person moving to the upside or downside of the platforms to hit their weakness while the other person collects the loot so not only do you cooperate to traverse the platforms by jumping off each other, but you also cooperate to defeat enemies and collect loot.

Most puzzles are cool and the game definitely has its fun moments. However, sometimes the game forgets that it is a puzzle game and becomes a very precision-oriented skill-based game, especially during the last levels. That is something that can be quite annoying if you do not like those kind of games. Nevertheless, the game is not very special and its full price is too expensive for what it offers.

ibb & obb can offer:

1) 15 usual levels plus 8 hidden, secret levels; those regular levels will gradually increase in length, difficulty, number of enemies and score;

2) co-op mode as well as solo play-through; solo mode significantly toughens the game, because you will have to control two characters by yourself, meaning while Ibb (say, your left hand) jumps and runs away from a bunch of blackened hedgehogs, Obb (now your right hand) is rushing away and breaks down the same hedgehogs from another side of the surface. Either is upside down, that again, adds more challenge.

Solo gaming is still possible, but it might take a player slightly longer to reach the end of a level.
Oh, and Carry them through the traps, hedgehogs and puzzles, that's a sweet challenging goal.

... they can crawl, fly and dive, jump and chase you. Not to mention that they vary in sizes too.

A player will encounter them in quite places and during pursuits. Precision timings and coordination is the key to proceed. Clear instruction and trust is a must. Of course you may always play a silly sausage and push your friend off a cliff and hear him yelling at you. ;)",Recommended,7 people found this review helpful 0,0

The puzzles definitely get serious and there are plenty of levels to work through for the price. The double pack is a good deal. There are even little hidden levels to find and conquer.

ibb & obb: A Blissful Co-op Puzzle Delight

Meet ibb and obb: two adorable blobs that look like they've jumped straight out a DOTS candy box. Yep, Little gumdrop doodads.

Their simplicity, showcased through a straightforward color palette and vibrant saturation, offers a pleasant visual experience. From the little characters to the levels they inhabit, everything exudes charm.

Controlling these bouncy creatures is a joy. Jumps and movements feel precise, making any missteps entirely my own doing, or occasionally my partner's sneaky nudging—though, I can't really blame the game for that.

Be prepared to perish, often in your buddy's company. A single touch from an enemy sends both players back to a checkpoint. But fear not, the game is kind, offering generous checkpoints that quell the frustration of restarting.

One might assume that with just a jump button, the puzzles would be shallow. Prepare for a surprise, as ibb and obb defies this notion entirely. The puzzles are nothing short of ingenious, thanks to the ever-present normal and inverse planes. Switching between these realms is the key to solving these cunning enigmas.

Much revolves around momentum—a concept expertly wielded in challenges. Momentum must be passed from one player to the other with the precision of a maestro's baton. Picture the portal puzzles in Co-Op, but add infinite fall momentum to launch your partner like a lightning bolt.

Beyond puzzle-solving, points beckon to be collected. Destroying enemies in their vulnerable plane spawns these collectibles. Secret challenges and tucked-away corners house hidden points, adding an extra layer of exploration.

Communication between players is pivotal, and the game offers both voice chat and a quirky smoke signal. I highly advocate for voice chat unless you enjoy slamming your head agaisnt the wall and enjoy frustrating your partner.

Online multiplayer reigns supreme in this Co-Op adventure, but the partner search could use some fine-tuning. A limited search made me redo levels, repeatedly rescuing my game partner who I had trouble speaking with given they refused to use voice chat. Yet, the true essence of ibb and obb lies in its LOCAL co-op gameplay—this is where it truly shines.

When all is said and done, ibb and obb stands as a fantastic puzzle game, crafted with co-op camaraderie in mind. Partner up with a kindred spirit, and you're in for a whirlwind of challenges and exhilarating victories.

I will say Steam offers ibb and obb in two packages, one game or a two-game bundle for a great deal. I wholeheartedly recommend the latter, so you can gift one to your co-op buddy in crime!",Recommended,4 people found this review helpful 0,0

The artwork is very charming, but the game is deigned to be too much of a puzzle with a single set solution. Many mechanics are quite punishing for little reason.

I found that they made it all too easy to unintentionally grief your teammate, through no fault of your own.

There were some interesting concpts, but some of the puzzles required your coop partner to sit there and watch you as you failed over and over again despite knowing the solution to the puzzle.

There are a lot of creative things about this game, but I alsso believe they made a lot of questionable design choices.

Why do you die everytime your idiot ally dies?

Why is it that for a coop I never feel like I'm working together with my teammate?
Why am I always getting in the way of my teammate and greifing them?

Why do these puzzles only have one solution to get past them?

On the other hand they have beautiful stylization, and what aI believe to be a very pretty communication system that you use without words, But this game is very unintentional.

I did however love the pricing for a twopack and I believe that all coopgames should follow a similar model wherein you are required to play with someone else, but an extra copy of the game costs a little bit more.",Not Recommended,12,4

ibb & obb is a puzzle platformer wrapped up in a beautiful and cute art style. Its simple presentation gets the job done. I was never once confused by mechanics as the game introduced them to me by showing me... and I didn't have to read one word. I was, however, often very confused by the puzzles! Which is a very good thing! My coop partner and I thoroughly enjoyed working together to solve puzzles and get the platforming tricks done. It's very satisfying to finally get through a puzzle and get to that party at the end of the level! There were even times when we got a bit snippy with each other because of the level of cooperation needed to get through. If you're considering buying this, just do it. I loved it. It's a perfect game to play with a friend. It was a real pleasure to play this game and I hope to see more from this developer!",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

""Ibb & Obb"" is a small co-op puzzle - platformer with a minimalistic colorful world, adorable characters, effective gameplay mechanisms, great pace, well balanced difficulty and nice music. But most importantly it's a game designed to focus on the cooperative experience, which is absolutely fantastic. The numerous puzzles, full of portals and paradoxes, are creative and challenging and require good communication and synchronization by both players. The final result is absolutely enjoyable and you'll certainly have several entertaining hours playing it along with a friend.


Manometer: 9/10


The good
- Cute, minimalistic, colorful graphics. It isn't anything special but some levels are pretty nice looking.
- Fantastic co-op experience. The players always have to think and work together, sometimes also synchronized, in order to beat each puzzle. One of the best games out there that are based on communication and interactivity.
- There is a big variety of creative puzzles and clever gameplay mechanisms that require imagination in order to solve them. Each level offers new challenges. Some of them require more thinking, while others quickness and synchronization.
- Simple yet effective control mechanics. Although the game essentially uses only a stick and a button (for jumping), there are so many different things to do.
- Well balanced difficulty. Great pace. It is challenging but never extremely harsh. You will get stuck at some points for a while but not for too long. Also, it gets more difficult gradually in order to let you smoothly embrace its world and mechanisms.
- Cool animations. They are also simplistic but smooth and funny (especially when Ibb and Obb stand still or stare passing by objects).
- Nice, energetic music that helps player find rhythm.
- Sound design is simple but also works well. Some sounds, like dying one, are hilarious.
- Adorable characters. Ibb and Obb are loveable, small balls are cute.
- It has some scattered collectables and hidden routes to discover here and there, which makes it even more challenging and gives it more replayability.
- It's a great idea to allow you draw lines with the right analogue stick (or the mouse) in order to communicate with the other player. It allows you to play it with someone without even needing voice or text chat.
- You can play it solo by moving both characters using the same keyboard or gamepad. It's so hard though, that I wouldn't recommend even trying it.
- It is very relaxing.

The bad
- I'm not sure if this is a fault of my internet connection or their servers or the actual game but there was a continuous lag everywhere. Constant frame drops along with disappearing, freezing or teleported characters will cause multiple accidental deaths. It is playable for sure but these glitches can get extremely annoying and take away a lot from the game's magic.
- The most common gameplay mechanism is when a player needs to climb over the other player's head (in order to perform a bigger jump). So, I assume that the characters should have been designed with square heads instead of rounded ones. This would be a lot more helpful in order to exactly know where you stand or when you have to be precise.",Recommended,5 people found this review helpful 0,0

This game is cute, has great music and challenging puzzles. And you play it in cooperation with a buddy. What's not to like?

The puzzles are challenging not only in regard to their solution. They often require both players to perfectly execute several steps in a row, with very little room for error. This can mean that you have already figured out the solution and make it halfway there but then you misstep: Start over. Then, your friend is too fast: Start over. Then, you jump a little too early: Start over. Then, your friend hits an enemy: You know the drill. Solving a puzzle can get quite tedious.
Another issue is savegames: One level took us up to an hour (in the later stages), depending both of how well we could crack the puzzle logic and execute the steps. During that, the game saved our progress just fine; if we failed a puzzle, we'd only be back at its beginning. But whenever we had to quit before finishing the level (or had a desync or just didn't feel like trying the same puzzle for the umpteenth time), the next time, we'd have to restart the whole level from the beginning.
Finally, playing it with a friend across the ocean, we found that in-game voice chat was delayed by a few seconds. Maybe it doesn't happen with less of a distance between you and your co-player. For us, it didn't help, what with some puzzles needing near-perfect timing. Towards the end, we thought about using an external solution like Raidcall, but it never came to that.
Overall, the game can get quite frustrating.

Before this, we played Portal 2, which did a better job of e.g. the savegame issue by having many smaller levels, so if you had to quit at some point, you wouldn't have to replay as much as in this game. And there, when you already knew the steps leading up to where you'd left off, they were usually pretty easy to reproduce. If you're looking for a fun coop puzzler, I'd rather recommend Portal 2.",Not Recommended,17,3

Pros
This game has a very relaxing atmosphere, and the soundtrack/ambience that plays in the background is very calming.
The art of the characters and the levels are amazing and adorable! I feel bad whenever I accidentally pop one of the little yellow balls.





Get it if you have a friend to play it with! It's quite hard to play it solo and nearly impossible to get another random player online to play with you, others may have had different experiences though.

I'm sure I've missed some things in my tiny little ""review"", but overall this game is very solid. It doesn't have any problems opening or closing, has voice chat when you get the chance to play with a random player online, and challenges players to communicate via ingame mouse movement or voice chat to solve ""puzzles"", assuming they want to get all of the points.",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

Playing through this with someone who doesn't play many games will probably be great for the first 8ish levels but really hard for the last ones.

Ibb & Obb is a puzzle platformer, gravity shifts frequently, allowing you to use momentum to solve puzzles.
We're both idiots, so we did need a walkthrough a few times.

I enjoyed killing my co-op partner in Ibb & Obb, repeatedly killing them by pushing them towards danger, to my own detriment as one person dying kills both.

It's just, the game's okay really. Nothing more nothing less. It gets tedious way before the end. Having to completely redo an unfinished level if you quit the game was kind of annoying. Don't play this alone or with strangers.",Recommended,6,2

ibb&obb is a really fun and addicting game if you play it together with a good friend of yours. I highly recommend buying the 2-pack bundle and to play with a friend.

The game is kind of a physics puzzle platformer. It is self-explanatory, from the first to the last stage you will see new elements being introduced in a way that requires no further explanation. It's intuitive and fun to explore the new elements.

The music in this game is a highlight. It matches the clean, calming artstyle perfectly and fits the athmosphere of the stages perfectly. Get the soundtrack if you can, you won't regret it.

The replay-value of this game is ok. As long as you have more friends to play it with, there will always be one who you can introduce to this game and trying to get 100% of the crystals and secret stages with them is just as fun as trying it for the first time.

What I dislike is that the audio volume resets every time you start the game, it's far too loud. Also, when playing with friends from overseas, the game suffers heavily from lag - not really the games fault, but I found that to be annoying sometimes, anyway.

I'd recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet and who has a friend to play this together with. I could imagine that single player is too hard, as you'd have to control both characters at once, but maybe you'll like the challenge of that, too.",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

First of all, This game is so much fun in co-op mode when you are voice chatting with friends on like skype or teamspeak, the voice-chat in the game Ibb & Obb has a big delay and does not sound very good. So we used teamspeak instead. Some levels are pretty hard to get through but that makes the game even more fun, because my friend and I are raging the hell out of it.

The Design of the entire game is fantastic. It has that simple look and the colours are vibrant, which I really like. Also the music is so awesome in this game, the music is really dreamy and fantasy which I really enjoy while I was playing this game.

ibb & obb: Gravity-Defying Love Quest

ibb & obb isn't just a game; it's a journey my girlfriend and I embarked on to test the limits of our teamwork – and our patience. Navigating through gravity-twisting puzzles and laughing at our synchronized mishaps has turned this game into our favorite.

Pros:
Cool mechanics
Adorable visuals that made us go ""aww""
Shared victories that brought us closer, one puzzle at a time.

Cons:
Nope. No cons.

ibb & obb taught us that relationships are like gravity – they keep us grounded even when the world turns upside down. It's a game where our laughter echoed louder than our frustrated sighs, and where we discovered that sometimes the greatest adventures are the ones you take with the one you love.",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 2,0

A really great little game, the puzzles and the platforming were both sufficiently challenging. The online play also works surprisingly well. The artstyle and music were also a good touch.

My only criticism is the white collectible gems serve basically no purpose. In order to actually get all of them the levels would become atleast 4-5 times more difficult and collecting only some of them gives no rewards so unless you REALLY like this game and want to spend a lot of time grinding for 100% the gems are just a weird distraction from the rest of the game.

I've always liked these types of co-op games, where both players physically depend on each other at all times to solve the puzzle, instead of being locked away in seperate rooms solving 2 different but realted puzzles. Ibb & Obb is very simple in concept, but some of the levels get pretty clever, and actually require some thinking.*
That being said, i would not recommend to play this for a few reasons.
1. Theres is a noticable difference between what the two players see. When i played this with my friend situations where it looked like i jumped in midair from his perspective, but in actuality i jumped off of his head. Normally this wouldn't be too big of an issue in a puzzle game, but then theres the second problem
2. Towards the end of the game, it devolves from ""oh thats clever"" to ""i cant tell if this is the intended solution"", some later levels only require technical skill from both players, and almost no actual puzzle solving. Due to these two problems me and my friend couldnt finish the game, it was just too inconsistent and infuriating.
3. This ones not as bad as the others, but it still significantly lowered my enjoyment of the game. For some reason, this game is very slow, the loading times take forever and the time the frames often go below 30.

If its on sale, sure, you can have a few hours of fun, but i would definitely not recommend completing the whole game.",Not Recommended,6 people found this review helpful 1,0

It's a similar experience to what we had playing Portal 2 co-op, occasionally hurting our brains trying to solve a puzzle and then facepalming when it becomes blatantly obvious (after you've spent 15 mins trying to solve it of course). ibb & obb actually has us both in tears a few times, just dying with laughter as we repeatedly fail jumps and die to the Studio Ghibli-esque wandering soots.

The graphics are PHENOMENAL - the simplicity of it all works so well and the vibrant colours make me so happy. Even the darker levels were executed so well and add to the game: You have just enough vision so that it doesn't hinder you playing (like so many other games where you can't see 2 inches in front of your face) and it's fun not being able to see the soots. Nothing like a spikey lil surprise to make your day eh?

Not gonna lie, I normally rage a bit while playing platformer/repeatedly dying games. Like I said earlier I've had the exact opposite happen..I cry with laughter when we keep dying. The whole atmosphere of the game is very zen-like and relaxing, and the gameplay is just so fun (lots of wooshing and sounds are made while flying through the sky) that I haven't raged or gotten annoyed whatsoever..which is great. :)

Can't recommend this game highly enough. What're you waiting for go grab a friend! And if you don't have any friends...you should rent one for a day just so you can play this game. It'll be worth it, I promise.",Recommended,2 people found this review helpful 0,0

What a amazing game. You can read my rating from the numbers of hours played :) Especially I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a cool platformer with kids. I really enjoyed every moment of those nearly 50 hours of gameplay.

With my eldest 9-year-old daughter we played the most time. We tweaked our performance trying to hit zen in every level. And we did succeed. What a great way to teach your kids persistency! We got all the 10 achievements and that is something as you may realize if you buy and play this game. It's hard work with your friend but try it with your kids! I wish you luck with that one ;)

With my 6-year-old boy we got familiar with the levels and tried to conquer them but not minding the diamonds and zen. This was a great way co-operate and of course persistency was needed here as well. Sometimes there were demanding timing and syncing challenges to overcome. But we usually did it and if we didn't in some parts we asked her sister to help :)

With my 4-year-old daughter we played the first four levels again and again which both of us became very familiar with. She did enjoy those levels more than me but you have to treat your kids equally. And it's an important thing for a kid such young to enjoy same games as the rest of the family.

I tried this game also with my wife but she wasn't too keen on ibb & obb nor computer games in general.

I liked the graphics and artwork and the world where our friends ibb and obb operated. I liked the physics and the 2-way-gravity in the game. With simple ""trampolines"" and ports to different gravitys you can make wonderful things as I learned while playing. Game had nice problems to solve what included syncing and timing tweaking with a partner or just thinking your head off how to get through and move on. We just loved being carried by another player and we had great talks while playing and figuring out what to do next and who does what and when. A nice way to teach your kids to communicate and to achieve common goals.

Sometimes we had to watch videos from Youtube to figure out certain secret levels but usually we solved problems ourselves.

We played with arrows and WASD so there were 50 hours of quality co-operation in close contact.

I loved it!",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

My younger brother and I beat this game like 6 years ago. It was freaking incredible. I loved it. When you have a decent amount of mechanical skill, and a friend who also does, and you enjoy MAD chill music and fun-to-solve puzzles, play this flipping game. One of the coolest co-op experiences ever, me and my younger brother grew together and recall this memory to this day.

Spent very lovely hours dying and dying again (and dying a bit more after that) with a friend. Lots of nice memories that are definitely worth more than the price I paid for the game, so I'm very glad it exists. The game is harder than I expected, a pleasant surprise. The level design is great, the puzzles where very interesting (and a lot of times challenging to figure exactly what to do) and not relied only in timing too often like some other games in the same style do. Art is very very adorable, I love the cute and colourful world we are in.

That being said, online co-op is VERY buggy. The game became almost unplayable and simply broken. We could not experience the ending because of one of this bugs, it was very confusing. Be aware while buying, some patience (as in, a lot of) will be required if you want to play online, but I believe its a worthy game even so.",Recommended,2 people found this review helpful 0,0

ibb & obb is a very cute, charming, and colorful co-op puzzle platformer. The idea is straight forward - you must work with your teammate to navigate various terrains and help each other reach certain areas that are otherwise impossible to reach on your own, all the while collecting crystals and avoiding enemies. There are 15 levels and 8 bonus areas that vary in difficulty from straightforward to having to think quite creatively/coordinating very precisely. The last 4-5 levels are difficult in terms of 100%ing them, but are still fun to do. The game is best played via online co-op; remote play together works, but given the precision timing that's required in some areas, it can be finicky.

All in all, the game is a lot of fun and is a great co-op puzzle platforming option for people interested in the genre.",Recommended,3 people found this review helpful 0,0

This is a game that completely changes based on how you play it and how long you've played it for.

At the 0 hour mark,
BTD6 is a cute monkey tower defense game that seems fairly straight forward. You just place down monkeys, and these colored balloons called ""bloons"" come that your little monkeys pop with darts. Your favorite Hero is Quincy, because he's all you have.

At the 25 hour mark,
you might have had a couple of people tell you what's ""good"" or ""OP"" in the game, then you start using these towers and upgrades for all your games. However, you still have no real understanding of what's going on in the game whatsoever, fumbling around in the dark and dying randomly to rounds all of a sudden when you thought you were doing great. Your favorite Hero is Striker Jones, and certainly not for the right reasons.

At the 50 hour mark,
you seem to find more towers and upgrades that seem to work or seem good. You might even start to catch on to the common ""problem"" rounds like 63, or start to think that you know a thing or two about the game. This is however, a fleeting illusion. And I assure you that you know nothing. Your favorite Hero is Obyn, because RISE!

you've won many games on many maps and difficulties. You may have even won your first C.H.I.M.P.S. game by following a guide. You start to think you're good at the game. What short-sighted vision! 90% of the game can still completely crush you at this point. You may even be tempted into purchasing completely pointless micro-transactions now that you're already hooked. Rest assured that doing so is completely pointless and will not make you any better at the game. There are a few rather brutal (you think) game modes *cough* Half Cash *cough* Apopcalyse *cough* which for the life of you, just can't beat. Your favorite Hero is DJ Benjamin, because let's face it, we were all there someday.

you've really started raking in the Monkey Money just by finishing maps and playing the game. You've already bought all the heroes and their skins. At this point, you start becoming increasingly greedy for game completion, you want those fancy looking ""Black Borders"" everyone is talking about. Unfortunately, you just haven't put enough time into the game at this point to have the knowledge or skill to beat all the game modes legitimately, and so you spam Cash Drops for hard game modes like Half Cash, and beat C.H.I.M.P.S. by watching guides. You fool yourself into thinking that you're a superior Bloons player, when you are in reality just a chimp. Your favorite Hero is Adora, because you think she's good when she's not.

for the first time you truly start to wonder: what the **** is actually going on in this game? I've watched monkeys pop ""bloons"" for 500 hours, but in truth, I understand nothing. Your thirst for understanding game mechanics deepens and your search for the truth begins. You join Discord servers seeking for knowledge from superior Bloons players (who just troll you, reply in esoteric memes, and say things like ""vrej""), spending hours reading long complicated Reddit posts and crawling through Google spreadsheets. Finally, you learn some proper terminology like ""damage"" and ""pierce"". Where was all this information in the game? You ask yourself. The striking revelation hits you like roaring thunder: It's simply not there! Nothing in the game tells you anything! ""tHiS iS A bIg pLaNe"", really? You even start reading those long detailed patch notes from every update. Your favorite Hero is Pat Fusty, because he's actually good.

for the first time, you actually feel like you understand the game just a little bit. And rest assured, if you've put that many hours into the game, you probably do understand it just a little. At this point, you can finally beat every game mode in the game legitimately. You may have even completed the easier Expert maps on C.H.I.M.P.S. You've found your way. No longer do you rely on any of the intentionally badly designed game ""features"" characteristic of mobile games. Cash Drops, Powers, and Instas become completely useless and pointless. The last time you've pulled out a Cash Drop was more than 500 hours of playtime ago. They're probably all piling up in the back closet like a mass of adult toys. Now all you want is to beat those hardest maps in the game. What they didn't tell you is that simply beating them all is not the end. Your favorite Hero is Quincy, the starter Hero, because he can beat every map on every game mode.

your priorities shift again. Your only goal is to become even better at the game. You realize completion is pointless and the only real growth is in experience and skill. You challenge yourself with the hardest game modes on the hardest maps in the game. But even that isn't enough, so you move into Challenge Editor to create and beat even harder game modes that don't even exist in the main game. C.H.I.M.P.S.? Why not try C.H.I.M.P.S. with only 2 Towers, or only 4th Tier towers, or only 1 DPS tower, or A.B.R. C.H.I.M.P.S., or C.H.I.M.P.S. with Triple HP MOABs. The possibilities are truly endless. Original theorycrafting also starts to come online at this playtime. You tap into secret knowledge known only to the most elite high-level Bloons players and think of completely new ways of understanding different parts of the game. Mastered Mortar micro? Try Ace micro. Haven't heard of RNG-manip in Bloons? Maybe you'll be the first to discover it. You start to question your favorite Hero, because even he can't beat some of these tough challenges.

you break through into the league of God tier Bloons players. Anything even in the main game becomes completely trivial. Name any 3 towers, and you will beat almost any map on any game mode with them first try. You turn off Monkey Knowledge because it makes the game even easier than it already is. You play every game with C.H.I.M.P.S. rules, and not even intentionally. If it was possible, you would Half your Cash for all games just for kicks. #Ouch becomes Couch and Puddles becomes Cuddles. Custom Challenges become trivial too. 2TC is a joke. Try Half Cash C.H.I.M.P.S. on Rake. Your favorite Hero is Adora, because you did 2MPC on X Factor with her.

The next challenge... is Reverse Half Cash A.B.R. Triple HP MOABs Double HP Ceramics Quadruple Bloon Speed C.H.I.M.P.S. on Bloody Puddles.

you return to the depths of filthy and paltry casual gameplay. You've played this monkey game for so many hours that all the endless chasing of top 3 medals and pushing of the skill ceiling has become... meaningless. You've already done it all and yet you've accomplished... nothing. What is there left to do other than make meme custom maps, impossible challenges and play C.H.I.M.P.S. on ""Your Mom but at a different angle""? Or as DJ Benjamin says, ""Turn up the Double Cash!""

→ Bloons TD 6 is set in a near-orwellian dystopian future where humanity's evolution has taken an alternate path; Evolving us into hyper-intelligent monkeys running a banana-fueled economy, which has been propped up precariously with a monkey housing-market shadow-banking scheme (but with banana bucks and bloons). Use government sponsored bloon-money (read: blood-money) to hire genetically engineered super-monkeys, psychopathic mercenary soldiers, surgically-enhanced unfeeling cyborgs, feed live sacrifices to the monkey Sun God, and to generally create horrendous weapons of mass poppage that will help you on your monkey business preventing the EXTREMIST Bloon terrorists from passing through and INFLATING the monkey economy, POPPING the housing-market bubble your monkey government has entrusted you, Big Brother, to protect. Do your duty and prevent BILLIONS of innocent monkeys from spiralling into homelessness and poverty by keeping bloon-kind chained where they belong, floating the economy and holding up Big Banana Goverment.

== The gameplay ==
→ BTD6 is a highly addicting tower defense game with amusing and diverse paths to create the mystifyingly satisfying noise that is balloons popping. (If you like the sound made by messing with bubble wrap, you've just found your gamer crack.) You start off placing your typically cheap monkeys-for-hire on the track, and gain progressive account-bound experience that unlocks tower upgrades and points for a monkey talent-tree that keeps you coming back for another go, while also keeping you from being overwhelmed by the insane mass of tower options and build paths you eventually have straight from the beginning. By the end of it you'll be plopping down mortars that can focus fire anywhere on the screen, helicopters that follow your cursor (or the enemy bloons if you're lazy), druids who spam chain lightning, and even necromancers who resurrect zombie bloons that move backwards on the track, popping their former brethren.

== On the pay-to-win issue ==
→ Even if you're a player like me who typically hates grinding for unlocks, the gameplay is so satisfying I felt like I was making typical progress in a monkey RTS / RPG rather than being slogged down and penalized for not making in-game purchases. The pay-to-win isn't much of an issue in multiplayer either (it just means an easy co-op win).
→ If you're having trouble with the progression I recommend spiking your upgrade unlock rate without spending real money in a couple of ways:
(A) Git gud and out-scale the bloon waves past the end wave into freeplay mode for BIG wads of player XP
(B) Run a few maps blazing-fast over-and-over again for wave-based XP that goes towards towers present on the screen.
(C) Getting lots of free the micro-transaction currency from first time map wins and challenges (hint: there is sometimes big bonus currency for winning a randomly selected map on each difficulty tier even after you've 100%'d, bigger on higher difficulty, and quests given on the home screen for even more).
(D) use free OP towers you get from near-constant in-game events and map victories for play-to-win ez mode on challenges and maps you're too lazy to tryhard on, or
(E) get carried by the bored 1000-hour randos in easy/intermediate queue who've ended up with WAAAY too much free micro-transaction currency and map-victory towers in co-op queue.

== Some things of note + tips ==
1) In co-op mode, the dev has made a brilliant design decision to prevent actual text typing and you instead communicate through a monkey-see monkey-do style emote menu. Communicate like its monkey Dark Souls.
2) There is a massive, extremely NOT-casual difficulty spike as you go upwards towards expert maps. Get together with the bros for co-op and rip out your hair together while having tons of headache-inducing fun in voice chat on Discord, scheming how the hell you're supposed to win without backing onto your play-to-win towers that are straight-out disabled on certain challenges.
3) I've seen this game on sale for $0.99 at least twice so far at the time of this writing, pop it on your wishlist and you might catch it that way again.
4) By some form of dark magic, this game has an active Youtube community with lots of gameplay tips, tricks, and mind-exploding big brain tower micro for you to dig up. Give it a search!

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2020 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",Recommended,"1,323 people found this review helpful

So many times I'll see the dismissive and insulting put down of a game on here - ""it's a poor mobile port"". And I mean, in a lot of cases, they're not wrong. A lot of junk does get pulled over from mobile and often with an inflated price tag too, and often done quite lazily.

Happily while this IS very much a mobile game, it is a shining example of how to do it right, and just because it lives on mobile, it CAN exist here too.

Right off the bat, this is obviously a Tower Defence game, so of course it works well on mobile screens. However, it is not a lazy copy/paste of other games. It very much does it's own thing and after at least 5 other main entries, they've refined and added so much to make it a compelling and quite deep game all round.

Plenty of maps, and the ""towers"" in this game are the monkeys who have different abilities. YOu have your basics here - the basic single shot type, the area of effect blaster, the elemental or explosive attackers too. But it's more diverse than that. It's by no means a simple rock/paper/scissors that so many tower defence games descend into, where you have to pre-empt the next wave and build towers to suit.

No, this game has monkeys which can only be used on certain types of land (and in later stages, the land gets rather minimal too), have really diverse capabilities to combat enemies like camouflaged balloons that only they will track or reveal, or metal balloons that require a sniper or cannon type to pierce. So the balancing act here is much deeper and entertaining, especially when you get to harder difficulties.

The ""enemies"" in the game, being the balloons themselves, and they are MANY! There's something lovely and cathartic about hearing shedloads of balloons get popped at once, and this lends to the enjoyment well. Later waves will often become overwhelming instantly if you've made poor choices in tackling them ,as there's just that many that come in waves. But despite this, it's fair. If you mess up, you learn what you did wrong and fix it next time.

On top of this, there's a basic levelling/XP system where levelling up rewards you with XP points to improve your monkey's abilities slightly. Again, this is a great help with harder difficulties and later maps, and I feel is REALLY well balanced. You earn about at the right rate as you play. It's so easy to get that bit wrong.

On top of this, there's added frippery like cosmetics and UI changes and so on if you wish for it, as well as daily, weekly and monthly custom challenges and seasonal events. These are usually rewarded with different skins, or heroes or sometimes new monkeys themselves.

All in all it's not only well polished, well paced and deep enough to keep coming back to, but it has enough there for repeated play even if you finish the main game (which I'll point at out 60 hours in myself, I still have not finished).

So, as tower defence games go, this is right up there with Defense Grid, Sanctum and some of the other shining examples. Don't overlook it as a mobile cash in because it isn't. If you like tower defence you will absolutely love this, especially if you like the cute aesthetic. Ninja Kiwi seem well involved in keeping up interest with the events and challenges so I doubt anyone would tire of this quickly at all.",Recommended,231,9

The eighth entry in the Bloons Tower Defense universe, BTD6 does not dissapoint. It stands as a grisly and realistic representation of war, and it does a very good job of what it set out to be. An emotional journey from start to finish, forcing you to question the morality of your very being. It pits brother against brother in a violent war of attrition, and it doesn't shy away from covering controversial topics considered too problematic for media today. The protagonist himself isn't a cookie-cutter perfect individual either. He has flaws which are expressed extremely well and serve as a driving force for the main story, making you question his next move. BTD6 does a superb job of putting you in the shoes of its characters and forming connections to them. You feel what they feel every step of the way. It's chock full of emotional scenes that will leave you sobbing one moment, then filled with hope the next. BTD6 is a wonderfully crafted game, with substance that will keep you going for months.

If there is only one piece of media you need to experience in your life, it is Bloons Tower Defense 6.

Truly, a masterpiece of a game.",Recommended,348,11

I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be.

After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:

If you like tower defence games: I recommend.
If you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.
If you want something casual and chill: I recommend.
If you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.

The tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special ""paragon"" towers)
The game devs have been providing free updates for years.
There's lots of achievements and medals to get.
There's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.

The game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!",Recommended,145,9

I live in a one story house in the suburbs, my address is 308 Negro Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque New Mexico 87104, my name is Banana Bateman. I am 27 years old. I believe in wiping out bloons as a whole, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a bit bloon like I'll put on an ice pack while practicing throwing darts at bloons, I can pop a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I hop on my computer and boot up Bloons TD 6 to start my bloon poping genocide for the day. I pick my favorite map, Monkey Meadow. I usually like to start out with Sauda and a dart monkey. I'll save up to start buying banana farms which I upgrade to 2-0-0. I will then farm till I am able to buy my favorite tower, the super monkey. After I then start the process to obtain the vengeful true sun god, once done I leave my computer, grab my banana bunch, and leave for work. By the time I get back the game will usually end on round 268, my best is round 302. There is an idea of a bloons player. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real player. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our playstyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.",Recommended,231,0

For anyone who played btd4/btd5 and liked it, I would say BTD6 is a huge improvement and well worth getting. For people new to the BTD series, I think this is a good tower defence game with plenty of strategic possibility both for casual/lazy players and those keen on higher effort gameplay. Placement/combinations absolutely matter, and all towers can be put into reasonably effective use, but don't expect to just throw random towers around and win everything.

This game is NOT!!!! pay to win at all, despite containing one useful iap (double cash), and some typically irrelevant ones which nobody ever needs (the usual assortment, basically ingame money, skillpoints, and free consumable towers).

People who are more interested in achievements/full completion than just playing for fun, be aware that some achievements are grindy/slow and certain track sub-mode completion medals are ridiculously hard to get, involving VERY accurate placements, spot-on timing, and some random factors which effectively force multiple attempts. I have all singleplayer medals though and only one achievement left (cant be bothered buying race attempts to get it sooner) so it is doable.

I think this is a great single player game, co-op however, either stick to easy modes or play with a friend, else frustration is likely. And I will say this one more time, tower combinations matter. Buffing effects matter. Don't just throw random things around without thinking, learn what towers pair well or you will miss half the point of the game and fail to defend on basically anything above beginner difficulty.",Recommended,100,0

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to play BTD6. The sheer intellectual fortitude required to strategically place your monkey towers and pop those pesky bloons is simply unparalleled. It takes a superior level of cognitive prowess to comprehend the intricacies of the game's mechanics and the optimal placement strategies for each tower.

While you mere mortals waste your time on mindless games, the BTD6 connoisseurs engage in a mental dance of precision and calculation. Every placement decision must be weighed carefully, taking into account the pathing of the Bloons, the unique abilities of each tower, and the optimal combinations to create devastating strategies. It's a mind game that separates the intellectuals from the casual gamers.

And let's not forget the magnificent tower upgrades that add another layer of complexity. As you ascend to higher levels of play, the choices become more critical, requiring a deep understanding of the game's intricate mechanics. It's not just about popping bloons anymore; it's about mastering the art of synergy and finding the perfect balance between offence and defence.

Oh, and the diversity of bloons themselves! From the humble red bloon to the mighty BAD, each bloon presents its own challenge, demanding careful planning and adaptability. And let's not forget the DDT, which will end you in the blink of an eye if you're not prepared. Only the truly gifted can handle the ever-increasing waves of bloons, adjusting their strategies on the fly, performing godlike micro, and emerging victorious against overwhelming odds.

But let's face it, dear non-BTD6 players, you're missing out on an intellectual feast. While you fumble around with mind-numbing games that require no more than mere button mash, we conquer intricate monkey-based warfare with our genius minds. BTD6 is not just a game; it's an intellectual masterpiece, a testament to human ingenuity, and a celebration of strategic brilliance.

So go ahead, continue your mundane gaming endeavours, but remember, you'll never quite reach the heights of intellectual stimulation and mechanical complexity that BTD6 offers. The bloons await their demise at the hands of the chosen few, the intellectually elite players who can truly appreciate the unparalleled greatness of Bloons TD 6.",Recommended,309,17

This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",Recommended,571,0

War. War never changes. And now, the rubbers come again to decimate what remains of our people. We have managed to hold our ground against them on 5 separate occasions. Now, they think they are being crafty by sending in even MORE types of Bloons and blimps.

They thrive off of death - fueled by CO2 taken from the fallen. We taunt them by laughing directly at them - exhaling that precious resource they need to survive. Other's simply make a gesture. Just look at the face of the Sub Commander as he points at the next target. Our weapons have improved since the last crusade. New monkeys have joined our ranks. Proof that every life lost is a spark fueling the rebellion further.

As long as our darts are sharpened, our magics are prepared, our bombs and tacks are ready... we shall stand together. We shall pop wave after wave until they finally stop coming. They think lead and ceramic are protection enough but they are naive. The Bloons have even resorted to heresy and dark magics to gain an upper hand - and we brought in Druids and Alchemists. They are only stalling the inevitable. Though it seems they've created a new type of Blimp to simply blitzkrieg our defenses. We must remain stalwart and not completely underestimate them in their desperation to pillage our Monkey Villages.

We're taking the war to new Maps and Terrains - to places we've never gone before. We must live in unity rather than fear. And new Champions are rumoured to stand as Heroes alongside our fellow monkey brethren. These Heroes represent something we've not yet seen before. Hope.

There is no fear; for the Monkey Sun God is with is. And by His fire, the rubbers shall be cleansed, purged and redeemed. Let us pop until every last one of the rubbers is GONE and we can finally live in peace amongst our banana farms at last. There is much work to be done.",Recommended,195,4

This game is the epitome of casual fun. It's super accessible, fun, and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ challenging at times. I'm over 100 hours in, and not even close to black bordering everything or even getting all the Monkey Knowledge.

This is quite literally my favourite tower defence game. It improves on BTD5 in every way, and it's simplicity and fun loop places it above most tower defence games for me. Plus the game is super cheap. If the £7 asking price is too much for you, the game constantly goes on sale for about £1, so like... Get it. You got nothing to lose.

Plus y'know... Monke.

TLDR
Bloons TD 6 is the mick jagger of tower defense game. A little bit wacky, fun, unique style and definitely a jewel for TD gamers.

Non-TLDR
Bloons TD 6 (BTD 6), developed and published by Ninja Kiwi. The PC version was relased on Dec 17, 2018 and it is also available on the Iphone/Ipad. On Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bloons-td-6) it has:
0 Metascore from critic reviews
An average user score of 7.4 from 30 ratings

If you've played Flash games before, you'd probably come across bloon td. if you are someone who loves tower defense games, you'd probably slay a ton of bloons before ninja kiwi (and other flash game developers) migrated to steam because Flash is no longer supported by Adobe. So these group of people have seen how bloon td evolved till today.

As for the younger generations, this may seem like some wild, crazy, mess up monkey revenge business against balloons. Did i mention that it was also fun/can be frustrating at the same time?

BTD 6 offers players 40 over maps to play. it comes in 3 difficulty and each difficulty has different set of challenges - that will test your skill and knowledge. For some odd reasons, BTD 6 has a complicated map system for online/co-op game play.








Your towers have it's own leveling system. Aside from that, the more you play, you also gain up exp for your own account - this is the monkey knowledge system. As you level up, you gain monkey knowledge points which can be used to purchase ""perks"" for your towers or heroes tower. Yes, there are heroes tower which needs to be unlocked & purchased (not microtrans). If i am not mistaken, the first 2 heroes can be unlocked and given to you after you reach certain levels.

Other than all of the above, you now have:


On top of all of this, it has a trophy store, where you can purchase various in-game elements; visuals/ui/emoticons. Nothing that can affect the gameplay. You earn trophy from odyssey game mode. finally, it has a microtransaction shop.

BTD 6 isn't just your standard Tower Defense game with all this features.

Visuals: It's 3d'ish looking. colorful, clean. certain maps have objects to interact/block your line of sight. Monkeys and bloons have been properly designed. no complains. +1 to the team

Audio: Energetic vibe. I believe you can purchase additional soundtrack from the trophy store. (yet to try). There's a jukebox to enable. +1 to the team

Controls: Mouse. For more advanced/hardcore gamers, you can use keyboard keys.

As a tower defense game, your goal is to prevent the bloons from exiting the map. If it does, your life will be deducted. Once you lose all of your life, the game ends. At this point, you can either replay from scratch or use monkey cash to re-try again.

What makes BTD 6 complicated is the difficulty and what game mode you are playing on. A standard easy vs Deflation easy is 2 totally different game mode while they share the ""common"" easy rules. Same concept applies to the other difficulty/harder maps.

On the surface it may seem like all the maps and bloons are the same. So, what exactly makes the game ""harder""?
The first criteria is the game mode which you are playing. It will set the tone on how hard/what sort of challenge you will be presented. (1 hp game, magicians tower only, reverse path, half cash etc)

The second criteria is the difficulty levels. On a general note, the higher difficulty you play, you will be required to play more levels. easy: 40 levels. medium 60. hard 80. you will encounter much harder bloon types (mix and match from various properties: camo, ceramic, metal, rainbow, regrow, FORTIFIED! etc). The bloon type is what dictates ""how hard the game"" will be.

In order to beat hard maps, you will definitely need to max out your tower levels and invest into monkey knowledge. Heroes are not prominent until you start to play on hard maps or you have a particular way of playing/sync it with other towers.

The tower themselves are unique and depending on your style of play, you can mix and match certain tower styles. In this sense it gives flexibility to the players - some may opt of the ninja tower but others prefer the sniper.

Bloon TD has come a long way. I wouldn't say BTD 6 has revolutionize tower defense games but it's certainly not your average tower defense. What makes it fun/challenging is the bloons. Knowing your enemy properties and spawn at which level will greatly increase the gameplay experience else its going to be bonkers.

40 over maps playing solo can feel repetitive and boring. On harder maps, where you are required to play 80 levels or more (more time spent) can be a turn off after xxx hours.

Going co-op, you will have to stick with the map layout and without a proper way to communicate, can turn the game into a messy monkey business. Spamming of emoticons that doesnt make sense. I dont voice chat unless i am playing with my friends. in other words, playing online with public you have to bare with the: 1) map layout (free for all or play in a section of the map), 2) communication limitation 3) knowledge of the person..and style of play
can lead to a experience.

ever played in a co-op map where one of the player just build 1 tower in a hard game map?
or leaves immediately once the game starts?
or mass tower hugging at the entrance?

On the other hand, if you are playing with knowledgeable people, you learn and have more fun. I wished there was a way to add them into your friend list. I would love to have more co-op maps that are free to play style than sections though.

So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Bloon TD 6 is a no-monkey business, creative coconut mess that is fun. An easy 8/10.",Recommended,98,0

--- REVIEW ---

I am going to list my resons for and against buying this game and will conclude the review with my personal opinion.

PROS:
+ Easy to learn (even my 60 year old father understands the game's mechanics)
+ Nice graphics and effects
+ Relaxing soundtracks
+ Daily challenges and more events (e.g. Boss battles, contested territory, odysseys)
+ Lots of ways to customize your experience as a player (many unlockables in the trophy shop)
+ MANY playable maps (at LEAST 10)
+ Many ways to play the same maps (not in terms of official gamemodes, but you can limit yourself by using only one type of tower for example)
+ A lot of achievements (they help you in-game by giving you useful stuff like monkey money, insta-towers and more and outside of the game, you can flex with them around your friends)
+ Playable both solo or with up to 3 other players (multiplayer CAN make the game much easier at the beginning, gets chaotic really fast)
+ No P2W (you can, if you want to, but everything can be done without spending a single cent)
+ Runs pretty smoothly as long as you stop playing at a round higher than 100
+ This game gets frequently new content added (most recently a new paragon tower)
+ The game has an active modding community (BEWARE: Mods can get you ""banned"" when used in multiplayer or on ranked events!)

CONS:
- This game used to be half the price it is currently (RECOMMENDATION: Wait for a sale!)
- Once you reach a high round (100+), the screen will be full of monkeys and more, making finding your cursor is as difficult as finding Waldo (or Wally, depending where you are from)
- The gameplay itself stays the same (what I am trying to say is that once you found a consistent strategy to win, you will probably not try new things out and that makes the game really boring, especially on high rounds when all you can do is stare at the screen and hope that the 1 FPS hell finally comes to an end (usually at round ~150)
- There is no motivation to play further than round 100 (seriously, no achievement, no better insta-monkeys, NOTHING)
- We tried the coop-mode many times on many occasions and we found out that the connection is really unstable (either you or your friends get kicked out and in the end you play solo again)

CONCLUDING WORDS:
I recommend this game, because it is a pretty fun single player game, which can be modded and also played together. I got this game for about 6€, which is half the current normal price, therefore I recommend you to wait for a sale (honestly, always wait for sales). If you are looking for a game with deep lore, that is also made for multiplayer only, then you are wrong here. BTD6 is made for casual players with a hatred against the evil bloons, who also play solo most of the time. New content is being added frequently, which makes the game feel more alive. If you are looking for a game with many achievents, which are also tricky to unlock, then this game is made for you. You also definitely need good strategic knowledge to properly advance in this game.

I went into this game with a deep fondness for the fifth installment of the series and actually held off playing this for the longest time. Maybe it was because I just needed to get used to the art style or something, but either way, I got some motivation to sit down and play it once and for all.

The comments below are my thoughts!


* A downright ludicrous amount of upgrades, with three paths per tower that now go into the fifth tier
* Extremely tight balance that's only getting better via patch updates
* The art style really grew on me as I played it, it looks fluid in motion and very pretty
* While some songs are certainly taken from 5, the new tracks are beautifully composed
* Between unlocking all of the upgrades, monkey knowledge, and heroes, alongside the vast amount of tracks to play, rest assured you're getting bang for your buck
* Between the purple bloons, DDTs, and BADs, there are more bloons to assassinate than ever before!


* Microtransactions are here, but far from mandatory to get the most out of BTD6. I actually purchased Double Cash mode alongside a decently large number of Monkey Knowledge points, though half of the reason was to support the developers.
* While there have been many improvements and new additions to the game, some cool features from 5 are missing, such as the specialty buildings and a select few towers


* There's still quite a few visual bugs to be ironed out, such as upgrades on your monkeys showing the incorrect description (but rather the description for the next upgrade) and a pretty bad bug with the tutorial that leaves you stuck in it forever with no way out (other than to just leave).
* I hate to be that guy, but Bloonchippers and Dartlings were pretty sad removals


I was utterly blown away by how good this game is right now. The balance, look, feel, all of it is incredibly addicting and charming to play. And while it could certainly use some additions and fix some kinks, BTD6 is here to stay and I'm very glad it turned out the way it did. Even I, a hardcore BTD5 enthusiast, cannot see myself going back to that game anymore now that 6 is here and offers so much more. Support the developers, guys!",Recommended,61,0

In the 21st century, war has evolved to a far more pressing issue: BLOONS. The world’s most menacing adversaries are no longer armies or empires but a horde of colorful, floating menace. The bloons are everywhere—popping up in every corner of the globe, from peaceful villages to sprawling cities. The only strategy for survival? Defend yourself with an arsenal of towers and monkeys, and keep those bloons from reaching their goal.

In 2077, the apopalypse reached a fever pitch. For hours on end, every street, every neighborhood, every patch of land was under siege from an endless stream of bloons. From this chaos, a new kind of defense force emerged—a squad of brave monkeys, armed with darts, lasers, and explosive pineapples, determined to stem the tide of the bloon onslaught.",Recommended,149,0

I have been a happy btd player since I first picked up btd 3 on coolmathgames.com in 1st grade. The series has always made me happy, and btd 6 is no exception. nice sountrack, good ui, and gameplay that stays faithful to the base and earlier games, and improves on it without feeling too unfamiliar. There are challenging aspects of the game for those who want them, and there are easy ways to get long runs and tons of pops for those who want a more casual experience. I love btd6.",Recommended,71,2

Most of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother giving the game a chance.

The microtransactions barely do anything and are pretty irrelevant, you don't need them. All they do is level you up in the game which is something that is pretty easy to do and you don't earn much for levelling up; just some bonuses for your towers which are disabled on the higher difficulties anyway.

The game itself is very fun and in my opinion the best Bloons game so far. Every tower has three upgrade paths and 5th tier upgrades. There are lots of maps at various difficulty levels as well as lots of different challenge modes. I played the game on my phone since launch and only recently got the steam version and this version runs a lot better than the phone version. I was having trouble on the phone because on high rounds the game will lag and sometimes crash but on here this doesn't happen. You can also transfer over your data between the different versions and it also transfers over to your steam achievements as well.

I only have one real problem with the game which is that if you put too many towers the game will crash and this is nothing to do with your pc, it's to do with the game engine itself.

This is a minor issue since i had to get every single max upgrade tower in the game down plus many other random towers in order for it to crash like this but at the same time it's a little disappointing if you're trying to see what the max round you can reach is. In the normal modes you probably won't encounter this issue because you won't be able to get enough money, you'll only encounter it in freeplay.

Despite some old towers not being in the game yet, the game is being updated relatively frequently and one has already been added back in the past so hopefully the others (especially engineer) will be added soon.

Bloons TD 6 is a highly addictive, top-down, 3D, tower defense game.
A game that might look like a flash or mobile port at first glance, but has way more depth and strategy than expected.

Each fight starts of in a map with a path running through it, your goal is to position monkeys to ensure that none of the enemy balloons make to the end of that path.
There are several different monkeys, all with their own special ability and upgrade trees.
As you make progress the enemy balloons get harder to pop and some balloons later in the waves can only be killed by monkeys that have the right upgrades.

There are special monkeys in the game too which are called Heroes, those can be bought with monkey money which is a in game currency.
This currency can be bought with real money but also earned by completing missions.
Heroes are special monkeys that you can bring into play, but unlike the standard monkeys, you are limited to only one of them in the fight at a time.
These special and strong heroes automatically upgrade each round until level 20, with each level unlocking a new buff or skill.

At level 30 you unlock Monkey Knowledge, which is another skill tree to make your monkey troopes even stronger.
Together with the tons of maps which vary in difficulty, challenges, events, achievements and CO-OP mode there is enough to do to keep you busy for many hours.

The graphics look fantastic, sharp, fun and colorful.
A really nice feature is that with each upgrade, that you buy for the monkeys they slightly change in appearance to make it easy to distinguish them.
The game is capable to suck me in and keep my attention by making it feel rewarding completing each wave and achieve a perfect highscore.

It's super addictive and it's by far my best 0,79€ spend.",Recommended,86,0

Leading up to Hitler’s rise to power, a Russian biologist named Ilya Ivanov garnered a great deal of infamy by perpetrating crimes against nature. At the behest of Joseph Stalin, Ivanov attempted to impregnate human women with chimpanzee sperm and female chimpanzees with human sperm. Stalin believed that human/ape hybrids would make the perfect soldiers, and could be used in combat operations. These hybrids would lack the mental capacity to challenge Stalin’s orders, but maintain the ferocity and strength to carry out these orders in ways that no regular men could.

Like it or not, the series is as close as we can get to Stalin’s dream, albeit a kid-friendly version.

I’d say it’s definitely worth it. I mean, you’ll have to come to terms with the fact that you are contributing to the romanticizing of botched chimp-man experiments, but the game is definitely fun. You might even say it’s addictive. But it’s only $10 at full price. What else can you get that’s addictive and only $10 at full price?— lasts more than 1 hour? Exactly.

Bought the game for $9.99, one day later it was on sale for $0.99. Does it matter? Maybe. Just looking an the incredible value in terms of hours played the game, I can say this has to be one of the best games I ever purchased. The game is still receiving new content updates, many events going on and if you like achievements - this is a great game too! Get together with some friends to pop some 'bloons' and I promise you, you'll have a great time.",Recommended,92,0

Update, 11/26/2023: Everything still rings true. The dedication of this development team is the stuff legends are forged with. Mostly forged into metallic objects that pop balloons.

Full disclosure: I started with Bloons TD1 that used to run on what is now an archaeological find known as Adobe Flash!

Before continuing: There is a cash shop in this game. It is not very intrusive and is only there when accessing the daily challenges or if you go looking for it. I have never once needed to purchase anything from this cash shop in my 440 hours of playing Bloons TD6. It is strictly for and that's it. Everything can be earned simply by playing the game and ! With that out of the way...

If you were to dismiss Bloons TD6 as a – I would not blame you. It is the finest in cartoon silliness. The game is filled with a multitude of monkeys using high powered, dart throwing weaponry to pop, deflate, or otherwise protect their home from balloons, or as these apes call them. From lasers to icicle spike throwers to literal catapults – This game has it all and more in weaponry.

Once you break through all this silliness in the presentation, you will realize that higher level play Efficient methods to properly manage money generation, minimal tower placement, reselling already placed towers to quickly change builds, counters for specific waves, or countering bosses – Just to name a few. It quickly goes from an fun distraction to a bit of a nerve wracking display of skill and planning.

Couple this together with an absolute love from the developers to keep adding in more content – New maps, new heroes, new towers, new bosses, new game modes, new aesthetics to unlock, etc. – It will be multiple hundreds of hours before you run out of stuff to work towards – I should know, I'm still at 440 hours and climbing. Yes, some of it can be more of the same – But there is just enough variety and difference in maps that it has a lot to offer in terms of new ways to challenge yourself.

Another advantage - For those who are looking for an approachable and fairly easy game for their young kids to play - This game definitely fits the bill. Easy enough to simply be fun on the lower difficulty modes and still offers rewards for your kiddos to unlock, they'll be finding new ways to throw darts at Bloons. Harder difficulties reward the kids with new monkeys they normally cannot afford to see on the lower difficulties, which in turn might make them challenge themselves. The game is rather brilliant in design for something that is just monkeys flinging sharp metal objects and air filled rubber balls.

There is online co-op, but from my limited experience most interactions are through predefined emotes to cut down on language barriers and introducing your 5 year old to George Carlin. This will not stop that one player from just sitting there and placing only farms and not sharing their money with you to just be a troll, but that is just open internet co-op these days. You could, in theory, be that awesome parent that just plays with their kids though. Be awesome Mom or Dad! There is only one form of competitive play that has recently released and it is fully PvE competitions for high scores rather than PvP competitions against other players.

With all of this, the beauty of Bloons TD6 is the fact that it can both be a fun distraction for when you just need some chill Bloon popping fun in your life or an extremely technical display of your gaming knowledge. Often times on sale for less than $10 USD. Pick it up if you like tower defense games and need something to fill that void for both fun and challenging.",Recommended,76,0
